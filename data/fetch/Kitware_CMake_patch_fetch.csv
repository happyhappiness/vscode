variable to ""http://localhost/CDash-trunk-Testing"" so that the CMake tests

The CTestSubmitLargeOutput test runs a dashboard that has a test that produces
very large amount of output on stdout/stderr. Since we do not even want	 to
attempt to send such large output over the wire, this test is off by default
unless the CMAKE_TESTS_CDASH_SERVER server is localhost. This test is expected
to cause a submission failure when sent to CDash. It passes if the submit
results contain error output. It fails if the submit succeeds.

network are skipped.
