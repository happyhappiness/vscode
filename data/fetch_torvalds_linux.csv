Pull XFS fixes from Darrick Wong:
 ""Here are three more fixes for 4.11.

  The first one reworks the inline directory verifier to check the
  working copy of the directory metadata and to avoid triggering a
  periodic crash in xfs/348. The second patch fixes a regression in hole
  punching at EOF that corrupts files; and the third patch closes a
  kernel memory disclosure bug.

  Summary:

   - rework the inline directory verifier to avoid crashes on disk
     corruption

   - don't change file size when punching holes w/ KEEP_SIZE

   - close a kernel memory exposure bug""
