/* ============================ Maxmemory directive  ======================== */

/* freeMemoryIfNeeded() gets called when 'maxmemory' is set on the config
 * file to limit the max memory used by the server, before processing a
 * command.
 *
 * The goal of the function is to free enough memory to keep Redis under the
 * configured memory limit.
 *
 * The function starts calculating how many bytes should be freed to keep
 * Redis under the limit, and enters a loop selecting the best keys to
 * evict accordingly to the configured policy.
 *
 * If all the bytes needed to return back under the limit were freed the
 * function returns C_OK, otherwise C_ERR is returned, and the caller
 * should block the execution of commands that will result in more memory
 * used by the server.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * LRU approximation algorithm
 *
 * Redis uses an approximation of the LRU algorithm that runs in constant
 * memory. Every time there is a key to expire, we sample N keys (with
 * N very small, usually in around 5) to populate a pool of best keys to
 * evict of M keys (the pool size is defined by MAXMEMORY_EVICTION_POOL_SIZE).
 *
 * The N keys sampled are added in the pool of good keys to expire (the one
 * with an old access time) if they are better than one of the current keys
 * in the pool.
 *
 * After the pool is populated, the best key we have in the pool is expired.
 * However note that we don't remove keys from the pool when they are deleted
 * so the pool may contain keys that no longer exist.
 *
 * When we try to evict a key, and all the entries in the pool don't exist
 * we populate it again. This time we'll be sure that the pool has at least
 * one key that can be evicted, if there is at least one key that can be
 * evicted in the whole database. */
