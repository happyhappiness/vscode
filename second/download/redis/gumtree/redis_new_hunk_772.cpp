 * PSYNC_CONTINUE: If the PSYNC command succeded and we can continue.
 * PSYNC_FULLRESYNC: If PSYNC is supported but a full resync is needed.
 *                   In this case the master run_id and global replication
 *                   offset is saved.
 * PSYNC_NOT_SUPPORTED: If the server does not understand PSYNC at all and
 *                      the caller should fall back to SYNC.
 * PSYNC_WRITE_ERROR: There was an error writing the command to the socket.
 * PSYNC_WAIT_REPLY: Call again the function with read_reply set to 1.
 * PSYNC_TRY_LATER: Master is currently in a transient error condition.
 *
 * Notable side effects:
 *
 * 1) As a side effect of the function call the function removes the readable
 *    event handler from "fd", unless the return value is PSYNC_WAIT_REPLY.
 * 2) server.master_initial_offset is set to the right value according
 *    to the master reply. This will be used to populate the 'server.master'
 *    structure replication offset.
