 *    when the slave finds that its master is fine (no FAIL flag).
 * 2) Also, the log is emitted again if the master is still down and
 *    the reason for not failing over is still the same, but more than
 *    REDIS_CLUSTER_CANT_FAILOVER_RELOG_PERIOD seconds elapsed.
 * 3) Finally, the function only logs if the slave is down for more than
 *    five seconds + NODE_TIMEOUT. This way nothing is logged when a
 *    failover starts in a reasonable time.
 *
 * The function is called with the reason why the slave can't failover
 * which is one of the integer macros REDIS_CLUSTER_CANT_FAILOVER_*.
 *
 * The function is guaranteed to be called only if 'myself' is a slave. */
