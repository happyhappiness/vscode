 * If NULL is used for 'init' the string is initialized with zero bytes.
 *
 * The string is always null-termined (all the sds strings are, always) so
 * even if you create an sds string with:
 *
 * mystring = sdsnewlen("abc",3");
 *
 * You can print the string with printf() as there is an implicit \0 at the
 * end of the string. However the string is binary safe and can contain
 * \0 characters in the middle, as the length is stored in the sds header. */
