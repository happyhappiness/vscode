/* The Redis HyperLogLog implementation is based on the following ideas:
 *
 * * The use of a 64 bit hash function as proposed in [1], in order to don't
 *   limited to cardinalities up to 10^9, at the cost of just 1 additional
 *   bit per register.
 * * The use of 16384 6-bit registers for a great level of accuracy, using
 *   a total of 12k per key.
 * * The use of the Redis string data type. No new type is introduced.
 * * No attempt is made to compress the data structure as in [1]. Also the
 *   algorithm used is the original HyperLogLog Algorithm as in [2], with
 *   the only difference that a 64 bit hash function is used, so no correction
 *   is performed for values near 2^32 as in [1].

/* =========================== Low level bit macros ========================= */

/* We need to get and set 6 bit counters in an array of 8 bit bytes.
 * We use macros to make sure the code is inlined since speed is critical
 * especially in order to compute the approximated cardinality in
 * HLLCOUNT where we need to access all the registers at once.
 *
 * +--------+--------+--------+------//
 * |00000011|11112222|22333333|444444
 * +--------+--------+--------+------//
 *
 * Assuming we want to access counter at zero based index 'pos' = 2.
 * (In the example it is "222222")
 *
 * The first byte "b" containing our data is:
 *   b = 6 * pos / 8 -> 1
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |11112222|  <- Our byte at "b"
 *   +--------+
 *
 * The amount of left shifting "ls" in the first byte is:
 *   ls = 6 * pos & 7 -> 4
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |2222    |  <- Left shift 4 pos.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * To add the bits in the next byte b+1, we need to right shift them right of
 * "rs" bits positions before xoring it to our current value in the first byte
 * (after the left shift):
 *   rs = 8 - ls -> 4
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |    2233|  <- Byte "b+1" right shifted 4 pos.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * Now we can just bitwise-OR the two bytes and mask for 2^6-1 in order to
 * clear bits 6 and 7 if they are set, that are not part of our 6 bit unsigned
 * integer.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Setting the register is a bit more complex, let's assume that 'val'
 * is the value we want to set, already in the right range.
 *
 * We need two steps, in one we need to clear the bits, and in the other
 * we need to bitwise-OR the new bits.
 *
 * This time let's try with 'pos' = 1, so our first byte at 'b' is 0,
 * "ls" is 6, and "rs" is 2.
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |00000011|  <- Our initial byte at "b"
 *   +--------+
 *
 * We store at "mask" the value 255, consisting of a byte with all bits
 * set to 1. We left-shift it of "rs" bits to the left.
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |11111100|  <- "mask" after the left-shift of 'rs' bits.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * Now we can bitwise-AND the byte at "b" with the mask, and bitwise-OR
 * it with "val" right-shifted of "ls" to set the new bits.
 *
 * Now let's focus on the next byte b+1:
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |11112222| <- byte at b+1
 *   +--------+
 *
 * To build the AND mask for the next byte b+1 we left shift it by "rs"
 * amount of bits a byte with value 2^6-1. Later we negate (bitwise-not) it.
 *
 *   +--------+
 *   |11111100|  <- "filter" set at 2&6-1
 *   |11110000|  <- "filter" after the left shift of "rs" bits.
 *   |00001111|  <- "filter" after bitwise not.
 *   +--------+
 *
 * Now we can mask it with b+1 to clear the old bits, and bitwise-OR
 * with "val" left-shifted by "rs" bits to set the new value.

/* Note: if we access the last counter, we will also access the b+1 byte
 * that is out of the array, but sds strings always have an implicit null
 * term, so the byte exists, and we can skip the conditional (or the need
