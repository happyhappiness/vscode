     * XXX: other_child - we need the process handles to the other children
     *      in order to map them to apr_proc_other_child_read (which is not
     *      named well, it's more like a_p_o_c_died.)
     *
     * XXX: however - if we get a_p_o_c handle inheritance working, and
     *      the parent process creates other children and passes the pipes
     *      to our worker processes, then we have no business doing such
     *      things in the child_main loop, but should happen in master_main.
