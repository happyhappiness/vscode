     *
     * | 7.2.1. Closure alerts
     * |
     * | The client and the server must share knowledge that the connection is
     * | ending in order to avoid a truncation attack. Either party may
     * | initiate the exchange of closing messages.
     * |
     * | close_notify
     * |     This message notifies the recipient that the sender will not send
     * |     any more messages on this connection. The session becomes
     * |     unresumable if any connection is terminated without proper
     * |     close_notify messages with level equal to warning.
     * |
     * | Either party may initiate a close by sending a close_notify alert.
     * | Any data received after a closure alert is ignored.
     * |
     * | Each party is required to send a close_notify alert before closing
     * | the write side of the connection. It is required that the other party
     * | respond with a close_notify alert of its own and close down the
     * | connection immediately, discarding any pending writes. It is not
     * | required for the initiator of the close to wait for the responding
     * | close_notify alert before closing the read side of the connection.
     *
     * This means we've to send a close notify message, but haven't to wait
     * for the close notify of the client. Actually we cannot wait for the
     * close notify of the client because some clients (including Netscape
     * 4.x) don't send one, so we would hang.
