  optimization can save a huge amount of backtracking in patterns with nested
  unlimited repeats that aren't going to match. Writing separate code for
  cased/caseless versions makes it go faster, as does using an autoincrement
  and backing off on a match.

  HOWEVER: when the subject string is very, very long, searching to its end can
  take a long time, and give bad performance on quite ordinary patterns. This
  showed up when somebody was matching /^C/ on a 32-megabyte string... so we
  don't do this when the string is sufficiently long.

  ALSO: this processing is disabled when partial matching is requested.
