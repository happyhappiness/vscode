      data a coherent message has not been delivered and the client
      can't read any of it.

      If we wanted to buffer the unwritten encrypted bytes, we would
      tell the client that all data it has requested to be sent has been
      sent. The unwritten encrypted bytes would be the first bytes to
      send on the next invocation.
      Here's the catch with this - if we tell the client that all the
      bytes have been sent, will the client call this method again to
      send the buffered data?  Looking at who calls this function, it
      seems the answer is NO.
