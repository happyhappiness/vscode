+- build-wolfssl: Update VS properties for wolfSSL v3.9.0
+  
+  - Do not use wolfSSL's sample user-setting files.
+  
+  wolfSSL starting in v3.9.0 has added their own sample user settings that
+  are applied by default, but we don't use them because we have our own
+  settings.
+  
+  - Do not use wolfSSL's Visual Studio Unicode character setting.
+  
+  wolfSSL Visual Studio projects use the Unicode character set however our
+  settings and options imitate mingw build which does not use the Unicode
+  character set. This does not appear to have any effect at the moment but
+  better safe than sorry.
+  
+  
+  These changes are backwards compatible with earlier versions.

-- tool_doswin: Use type SANITIZEcode in sanitize_file_name
+Steve Holme (19 Mar 2016)
+- build: Added missing Visual Studio filter files for VC10 onwards
+  
+  As these files don't need to contain references to the source files,
+  although typically do, added basic files which only include three
+  filters and don't require the project file generator to be modified.
+  
+  These files allow the source code to be viewed in the Solution Explorer
+  in versions of Visual Studio from 2010 onwards in the same manner as
+  previous versions did rather than one large view of files.
 
-- tool_doswin: Improve sanitization processing
+- ftp/imap/pop3/smtp: Fixed compilation warning when /Wall enabled
   
-  - Add unit test 1604 to test the sanitize_file_name function.
+  warning C4706: assignment within conditional expression
+
+- config-w32.h: Fixed compilation warning when /Wall enabled
   
-  - Use -DCURL_STATICLIB when building libcurltool for unit testing.
+  warning C4668: 'USE_IPV6' is not defined as a preprocessor macro,
+                 replacing with '0' for '#if/#elif'
+
+- imap.c: Fixed compilation warning with /Wall enabled
   
-  - Better detection of reserved DOS device names.
+  warning C4701: potentially uninitialized local variable 'size' used
   
-  - New flags to modify sanitize behavior:
+  Technically this can't happen, as the usage of 'size' is protected by
+  'if(parsed)' and 'parsed' is only set after 'size' has been parsed.
   
-  SANITIZE_ALLOW_COLONS: Allow colons
-  SANITIZE_ALLOW_PATH: Allow path separators and colons
-  SANITIZE_ALLOW_RESERVED: Allow reserved device names
-  SANITIZE_ALLOW_TRUNCATE: Allow truncating a long filename
+  Anyway, lets keep the compiler happy.
+
+- KNOWN_BUGS: #93 Issue with CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN in arrays on 32-bit platforms
+
+Daniel Stenberg (18 Mar 2016)
+- bump: the coming release is 7.48.0
+
+- configure: use cpp -P when needed
   
-  - Restore sanitization of banned characters from user-specified outfile.
+  Since gcc 5, the processor output can get split up on multiple lines
+  that made the configure script fail to figure out values from
+  definitions. The fix is to use cpp -P, and this fix now first checks if
+  cpp -P is necessary and then if cpp -P works before it uses that to
+  extract defined values.
   
-  Prior to this commit sanitization of a user-specified outfile was
-  temporarily disabled in 2b6dadc because there was no way to allow path
-  separators and colons through while replacing other banned characters.
-  Now in such a case we call the sanitize function with
-  SANITIZE_ALLOW_PATH which allows path separators and colons to pass
-  through.
+  Fixes #719
+
+Steve Holme (18 Mar 2016)
+- formdata.c: Fixed compilation warning
   
+  formdata.c:390: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
   
-  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/624
-  Reported-by: Octavio Schroeder
+  Introduced in commit ca5f9341ef this happens because a char*, which is
+  32-bits wide in 32-bit land, is being cast to a curl_off_t which is
+  64-bits wide where 64-bit integers are supported by the compiler.
+  
+  This doesn't happen in 64-bit land as a pointer is the same size as a
+  curl_off_t.
+  
+  This fix doesn't address the fact that a 64-bit value cannot be used
+  for CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN when set in a form array and compiled on a
+  32-bit platforms, it does at least suppress the compilation warning.

-  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/issues/624
-  Reported-by: Octavio Schroeder
+  Simplify the code by using a single entry that looks for a socket in the
+  socket hash. As indicated in #712, the code looked for CURL_SOCKET_BAD
+  at some point and that is ineffective/wrong and this makes it easier to
+  avoid that.

-  NTLM: Fix ConnectionExists to compare Proxy credentials
+- ftp: remove a check for NULL(!)
   
-  Proxy NTLM authentication should compare credentials when
-  re-using a connection similar to host authentication, as it
-  authenticate the connection.
+  ... as it implies we need to check for that on all the other variable
+  references as well (as Coverity otherwise warns us for missing NULL
+  checks), and we're alredy making sure that the pointer is never NULL.
+
+- cookies: first n/v pair in Set-Cookie: is the cookie, then parameters
   
-  Example:
-  curl -v -x http://proxy:port http://host/ -U good_user:good_pwd
-    --proxy-ntlm --next -x http://proxy:port http://host/
-      [-U fake_user:fake_pwd --proxy-ntlm]
+  RFC 6265 section 4.1.1 spells out that the first name/value pair in the
+  header is the actual cookie name and content, while the following are
+  the parameters.
   
-  CVE-2016-0755
+  libcurl previously had a more liberal approach which causes significant
+  problems when introducing new cookie parameters, like the suggested new
+  cookie priority draft.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20160127A.html
+  The previous logic read all n/v pairs from left-to-right and the first
+  name used that wassn't a known parameter name would be used as the
+  cookie name, thus accepting "Set-Cookie: Max-Age=2; person=daniel" to be
+  a cookie named 'person' while an RFC 6265 compliant parser should
+  consider that to be a cookie named 'Max-Age' with an (unknown) parameter
+  'person'.

+  TFTP: add option to suppress TFTP option requests (Part 1)
+  
+  Some TFTP server implementations ignore the "TFTP Option extension"
+  (RFC 1782-1784, 2347-2349), or implement it in a flawed way, causing
+  problems with libcurl. Another switch for curl_easy_setopt

-  http2: Support trailer fields
+- KNOWN_BUGS: Update #92 - Windows device prefix
+
+- tool_doswin: Support for literal path prefix \\?\
   
-  This commit adds trailer support in HTTP/2.  In HTTP/1.1, chunked
-  encoding must be used to send trialer fields.  HTTP/2 deprecated any
-  trandfer-encoding, including chunked.  But trailer fields are now
-  always available.
+  For example something like --output \\?\C:\foo
+
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Feb 2016)
+- configure: state "BoringSSL" in summary when that was detected
+
+- [David Benjamin brought this change]
+
+  openssl: remove most BoringSSL #ifdefs.
   
-  Since trailer fields are relatively rare these days (gRPC uses them
-  extensively though), allocating buffer for trailer fields is done when
-  we detect that HEADERS frame containing trailer fields is started.  We
-  use Curl_add_buffer_* functions to buffer all trailers, just like we
-  do for regular header fields.  And then deliver them when stream is
-  closed.  We have to be careful here so that all data are delivered to
-  upper layer before sending trailers to the application.
+  As of https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/#/c/6980/, almost all of
+  BoringSSL #ifdefs in cURL should be unnecessary:
   
-  We can deliver trailer field one by one using NGHTTP2_ERR_PAUSE
-  mechanism, but current method is far more simple.
+  - BoringSSL provides no-op stubs for compatibility which replaces most
+    #ifdefs.
   
-  Another possibility is use chunked encoding internally for HTTP/2
-  traffic.  I have not tested it, but it could add another overhead.
+  - DES_set_odd_parity has been in BoringSSL for nearly a year now. Remove
+    the compatibility codepath.
   
-  Closes #564
+  - With a small tweak to an extend_key_56_to_64 call, the NTLM code
+    builds fine.
+  
+  - Switch OCSP-related #ifdefs to the more generally useful
+    OPENSSL_NO_OCSP.
+  
+  The only #ifdefs which remain are Curl_ossl_version and the #undefs to
+  work around OpenSSL and wincrypt.h name conflicts. (BoringSSL leaves
+  that to the consumer. The in-header workaround makes things sensitive to
+  include order.)
+  
+  This change errs on the side of removing conditionals despite many of
+  the restored codepaths being no-ops. (BoringSSL generally adds no-op
+  compatibility stubs when possible. OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER #ifdefs are
+  bad enough!)
+  
+  Closes #640

+  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
   
-  Following the fix in commit d6d58dd558 it is necessary to re-introduce
-  XOAUTH2 in the default enabled authentication mechanism, which was
-  removed in commit 7b2012f262, otherwise users will have to specify
-  AUTH=XOAUTH2 in the URL.
+  Previously, when HTTP/2 is enabled and used, and stream has content
+  length known, Curl_read was not called when there was no bytes left to
+  read. Because of this, we could not make sure that
+  http2_handle_stream_close was called for every stream. Since we use
+  http2_handle_stream_close to emit trailer fields, they were
+  effectively ignored. This commit changes the code so that Curl_read is
+  called even if no bytes left to read, to ensure that
+  http2_handle_stream_close is called for every stream.

-  Background:
-  
-  Last week in 14d5a86 a change was made to allow the user to set the
-  PKGCONFIG variable. Today in 72d99f2 I supplemented that to allow the
-  more common PKG_CONFIG as an alternative if PKGCONFIG is not set.

+- sockfilt.c: added some debug output to select_ws
+
+- sockfilt.c: keep lines shorter than 80 chars
+
+- sockfilt.c: do not wait on unreliable file or pipe handle
   
-  Neither of those changes worked as expected because PKGCONFIG is
-  occasionally reset in configure and by the CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG macro.
-  Instead in this commit I take the approach that the user may set
-  PKG_CONFIG only.
+  The previous implementation caused issues on modern MSYS2 runtimes.

-
-  ftp: allow CURLOPT_IGNORE_CONTENT_LENGTH to ignore size
+  This commit adds trailer support in HTTP/2.  In HTTP/1.1, chunked
+  encoding must be used to send trialer fields.  HTTP/2 deprecated any
+  trandfer-encoding, including chunked.  But trailer fields are now
+  always available.
   
-  This allows FTP transfers with growing (or shrinking) files without
-  causing a transfer error.
+  Since trailer fields are relatively rare these days (gRPC uses them
+  extensively though), allocating buffer for trailer fields is done when
+  we detect that HEADERS frame containing trailer fields is started.  We
+  use Curl_add_buffer_* functions to buffer all trailers, just like we
+  do for regular header fields.  And then deliver them when stream is
+  closed.  We have to be careful here so that all data are delivered to
+  upper layer before sending trailers to the application.
   
-  Closes #480

-- CURLOPT_STREAM_WEIGHT.3: call argument 'weight' too

-  proportion of bandwidth".
-
-- http2: add stream options to dist and curl_easy_setopt.3

-- fread_func: move callback pointer from set to state struct
+  Other fixes:
   
-  ... and assign it from the set.fread_func_set pointer in the
-  Curl_init_CONNECT function. This A) avoids that we have code that
-  assigns fields in the 'set' struct (which we always knew was bad) and
-  more importantly B) it makes it impossibly to accidentally leave the
-  wrong value for when the handle is re-used etc.
+  - In curl_setup.h, the problem with an old PSDK doesn't apply if lwIP is
+  used.
   
-  Introducing a state-init functionality in multi.c, so that we can set a
-  specific function to get called when we enter a state. The
-  Curl_init_CONNECT is thus called when switching to the CONNECT state.
+  - In memdebug.h, the 'socket' should be undefined first due to lwIP's
+  lwip_socket() macro.
   
-  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/issues/346
+  - In curl_addrinfo.c lwIP's getaddrinfo() + freeaddrinfo() macros need
+  special handling because they were undef'ed in memdebug.h.
   
-  Closes #346
+  - In select.c we can't use preprocessor conditionals inside select if
+  MSVC and select is a macro, as it is with lwIP.

-- nss: prevent NSS from incorrectly re-using a session
+- curl.h: introducing the STRINGPOINT alias
   
-  Without this workaround, NSS re-uses a session cache entry despite the
-  server name does not match.  This causes SNI host name to differ from
-  the actual host name.  Consequently, certain servers (e.g. github.com)
-  respond by 400 to such requests.
+  As an alias for OBJECTPOINT. Provided to allow us to grep for all string
+  options easier.

+  tool: generate easysrc only on --libcurl
   
-  I spotted this while debugging <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1248389>
-  where the http_disconnect() handler was called on an FTP session handle
-  causing 'dnf' to crash.  conn->data->req.protop of type (struct FTP *)
-  was reinterpreted as type (struct HTTP *) which resulted in SIGSEGV in
-  Curl_add_buffer_free() after printing the "Connection cache is full,
-  closing the oldest one." message.
+  Code should only be generated when --libcurl is used.
   
-  A previously working version of libcurl started to crash after it was
-  recompiled with the HTTP/2 support despite the HTTP/2 protocol was not
-  actually used.  This commit makes it work again although I suspect the
-  root cause (reinterpreting session handle data of incompatible protocol)
-  still has to be fixed.  Otherwise the same will happen when mixing FTP
-  and HTTP/2 connections and exceeding the connection cache limit.

+- NTLM: recent boringssl brought DES_set_odd_parity back
   
-  The symbol SSL3_MT_NEWSESSION_TICKET appears to have been introduced at

-- FTP: do the HTTP CONNECT for data connection blocking

-  ** WORK-AROUND **
+- configure: detect latest boringssl
   
-  The introduced non-blocking general behaviour for Curl_proxyCONNECT()
-  didn't work for the data connection establishment unless it was very
-  fast. The newly introduced function argument makes it operate in a more
-  blocking manner, more like it used to work in the past. This blocking
-  approach is only used when the FTP data connecting through HTTP proxy.
+  Since boringssl brought back DES_set_odd_parity again, it cannot be used
+  to differentiate from boringssl. Using the OPENSSL_IS_BORINGSSL define
+  seems better anyway.
   
-  Blocking like this is bad. A better fix would make it work more
-  asynchronously.

-  
-  - Change fopen calls to use FOPEN_READTEXT instead of "r" or "rt"
-  - Change fopen calls to use FOPEN_WRITETEXT instead of "w" or "wt"
-  
-  This change is to explicitly specify when we need to read/write text.
-  Unfortunately 't' is not part of POSIX fopen so we can't specify it
-  directly. Instead we now have FOPEN_READTEXT, FOPEN_WRITETEXT.
+  NTLM: handle auth for only a single request
   
-  Prior to this change we had an issue on Windows if an application that
-  uses libcurl overrides the default file mode to binary. The default file
-  mode in Windows is normally text mode (translation mode) and that's what
-  libcurl expects.
+  Currently when the server responds with 401 on NTLM authenticated
+  connection (re-used) we consider it to have failed.  However this is
+  legitimate and may happen when for example IIS is set configured to
+  'authPersistSingleRequest' or when the request goes thru a proxy (with
+  'via' header).

-  http2: Copy data passed in Curl_http2_switched into HTTP/2 connection buffer
+- win32: Fix compilation warnings from commit 40c921f8b8
   
-  Previously, after seeing upgrade to HTTP/2, we feed data followed by
-  upgrade response headers directly to nghttp2_session_mem_recv() in
-  Curl_http2_switched().  But it turns out that passed buffer, mem, is
-  part of stream->mem, and callbacks called by
-  nghttp2_session_mem_recv() will write stream specific data into
-  stream->mem, overwriting input data.  This will corrupt input, and
-  most likely frame length error is detected by nghttp2 library.  The
-  fix is first copy the passed data to HTTP/2 connection buffer,
-  httpc->inbuf, and call nghttp2_session_mem_recv().

+- http: move HTTP/2 cleanup code off http_disconnect()
   
-  Coverity CID 1299424 identified dead code because of checks that could
-  never equal true (if the mechanism's name was NULL).
+  Otherwise it would never be called for an HTTP/2 connection, which has
+  its own disconnect handler.
   
-  Simplified the function by removing a level of pointers and removing the
-  loop and array that weren't used.
-
-- RTSP: catch attempted unsupported requests better
+  I spotted this while debugging <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1248389>
+  where the http_disconnect() handler was called on an FTP session handle
+  causing 'dnf' to crash.  conn->data->req.protop of type (struct FTP *)
+  was reinterpreted as type (struct HTTP *) which resulted in SIGSEGV in
+  Curl_add_buffer_free() after printing the "Connection cache is full,
+  closing the oldest one." message.
   
-  Replace use of assert with code that properly catches bad input at
-  run-time even in non-debug builds.
+  A previously working version of libcurl started to crash after it was
+  recompiled with the HTTP/2 support despite the HTTP/2 protocol was not
+  actually used.  This commit makes it work again although I suspect the
+  root cause (reinterpreting session handle data of incompatible protocol)
+  still has to be fixed.  Otherwise the same will happen when mixing FTP
+  and HTTP/2 connections and exceeding the connection cache limit.
   
-  This flaw was sort of detected by Coverity CID 1299425 which claimed the
-  "case RTSPREQ_NONE" was dead code.

+
+- test1902: attempt to make the test more reliable
   
-  Previously, when we send all given buffer in data_source_callback, we

-  temporarily for writing.  This itself is good.  If this is the sole
-  stream in the session, nghttp2_session_want_write() returns zero,
-  which means that libcurl does not check writeability of the underlying
-  socket.  This leads to very slow upload, because it seems curl only
-  upload 16k something per 1 second.  To fix this, if we still have data
-  to send, call nghttp2_session_resume_data after nghttp2_session_send.
-  This makes nghttp2_session_want_write() returns nonzero (if connection
-  window still opens), and as a result, socket writeability is checked,
-  and upload speed becomes normal.

-  Require nghttp2 v1.0.0
+  ntlm_wb: Fix theoretical memory leak
   
-  This commit requires nghttp2 v1.0.0 to compile, and migrate to v1.0.0,
-  and utilize recent version of nghttp2 to simplify the code,
+  Static analysis indicated that my commit 9008f3d564 ("ntlm_wb: Fix
+  hard-coded limit on NTLM auth packet size") introduced a potential
+  memory leak on an error path, because we forget to free the buffer
+  before returning an error.
   
-  First we use nghttp2_option_set_no_recv_client_magic function to
-  detect nghttp2 v1.0.0.  That function only exists since v1.0.0.
+  Fix this.
   
-  Since nghttp2 v0.7.5, nghttp2 ensures header field ordering, and
-  validates received header field.  If it found error, RST_STREAM with
-  PROTOCOL_ERROR is issued.  Since we require v1.0.0, we can utilize
-  this feature to simplify libcurl code.  This commit does this.
+  Although actually, it never happens in practice because we never *get*
+  here with state == NTLMSTATE_TYPE1. The state is always zero. That
+  might want cleaning up in a separate patch.
   
-  Migration from 0.7 series are done based on nghttp2 migration
-  document.  For libcurl, we removed the code sending first 24 bytes
-  client magic.  It is now done by nghttp2 library.
-  on_invalid_frame_recv callback signature changed, and is updated
-  accordingly.

+  - return 0 if len == 0. that will have to be documented.
+  - continue on and process the caches regardless of raw recv
+  - if decrypted data will be returned then set the error code to CURLE_OK
+  and return its count
+  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection has closed
+  (eg nread == 0) then return 0 and CURLE_OK
+  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection *hasn't*
+  closed then set the error code to CURLE_AGAIN --only if an error code
+  isn't already set-- and return -1

+  - Save connection closed state
+  - Change special Win2k check to use connection closed state
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 5
+  %%
+  - Default to CURLE_AGAIN in cleanup if an error code wasn't set and the
+  connection isn't closed.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 6
+  %%
+  - Save the last error only if it is an unrecoverable error.
+  
+  Prior to this I saved the last error state in all cases; unfortunately
+  the logic to cover that in all cases would lead to some muddle and I'm
+  concerned that could then lead to a bug in the future so I've replaced
+  it by only recording an unrecoverable error and that state will persist.
+  
+  - Do not recurse on renegotiation.
+  
+  Instead we'll continue on to process any trailing encrypted data
+  received during the renegotiation only.
+  
+  - Move the err checks in cleanup after the check for decrypted data.
+  
+  In either case decrypted data is always returned but I think it's easier
+  to understand when those err checks come after the decrypted data check.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 7
+  %%
+  - Regardless of len value go directly to cleanup if there is an
+  unrecoverable error or a close_notify was already received. Prior to
+  this change we only acknowledged those two states if len != 0.
+  
+  - Fix a bug in connection closed behavior: Set the error state in the
+  cleanup, because we don't know for sure it's an error until that time.
+  
+  - (Related to above) In the case the connection is closed go "greedy"
+  with the decryption to make sure all remaining encrypted data has been
+  decrypted even if it is not needed at that time by the caller. This is
+  necessary because we can only tell if the connection closed gracefully
+  (close_notify) once all encrypted data has been decrypted.
+  
+  - Do not renegotiate when an unrecoverable error is pending.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 8
+  %%
+  - Don't show 'server closed the connection' info message twice.
+  
+  - Show an info message if server closed abruptly (missing close_notify).

-  test(1) on HP-UX requires a single equals sign and fails with two.
-  Let's use one and make every OS happy.
+  Some servers will request a client certificate, but not require one.
+  This change allows libcurl to connect to such servers when using
+  schannel as its ssl/tls backend. When a server requests a client
+  certificate, libcurl will now continue the handshake without one,
+  rather than terminating the handshake. The server can then decide
+  if that is acceptable or not. Prior to this change, libcurl would
+  terminate the handshake, reporting a SEC_I_INCOMPLETE_CREDENTIALS
+  error.

-- openssl: fix serial number output
+  This change is to explicitly specify when we need to read/write text.
+  Unfortunately 't' is not part of POSIX fopen so we can't specify it

-  The code extracting the cert serial number was broken and didn't display
-  it properly.
+  Prior to this change we had an issue on Windows if an application that
+  uses libcurl overrides the default file mode to binary. The default file
+  mode in Windows is normally text mode (translation mode) and that's what

+  http2: Copy data passed in Curl_http2_switched into HTTP/2 connection buffer
   
-  Mistake-caught-by: Kamil Dudka
+  Previously, after seeing upgrade to HTTP/2, we feed data followed by
+  upgrade response headers directly to nghttp2_session_mem_recv() in
+  Curl_http2_switched().  But it turns out that passed buffer, mem, is
+  part of stream->mem, and callbacks called by
+  nghttp2_session_mem_recv() will write stream specific data into
+  stream->mem, overwriting input data.  This will corrupt input, and
+  most likely frame length error is detected by nghttp2 library.  The
+  fix is first copy the passed data to HTTP/2 connection buffer,
+  httpc->inbuf, and call nghttp2_session_mem_recv().

-  If a URL is given with a zero-length host name, like in "http://:80" or

-  vtls_openssl: improve client certificate load failure error messages
+  http2: Faster http2 upload
+  
+  Previously, when we send all given buffer in data_source_callback, we
+  return NGHTTP2_ERR_DEFERRED, and nghttp2 library removes this stream
+  temporarily for writing.  This itself is good.  If this is the sole
+  stream in the session, nghttp2_session_want_write() returns zero,
+  which means that libcurl does not check writeability of the underlying
+  socket.  This leads to very slow upload, because it seems curl only
+  upload 16k something per 1 second.  To fix this, if we still have data
+  to send, call nghttp2_session_resume_data after nghttp2_session_send.
+  This makes nghttp2_session_want_write() returns nonzero (if connection
+  window still opens), and as a result, socket writeability is checked,
+  and upload speed becomes normal.

+- Curl_conncache_add_conn: fix memory leak on OOM
 
-Dan Fandrich (24 Mar 2015)
-- symbols-in-versions: added CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS
+- CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS: host = host name + port number
 
-- testcurl.pl: add the --notes option to supply more info about a build
+- conncache: keep bundles on host+port bases, not only host names
   
-  Support for notes has been in place for a while, but it required
-  being added to the setup file manually.
+  Previously we counted all connections to a specific host name and that
+  would be used for the CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS check for example,
+  while servers on different port numbers are normally considered
+  different "origins" on the web and should thus be considered different
+  hosts.
 
-- curl_memory: make curl_memory.h the second-last header file loaded
+- bundles: merged into conncache.c
   
-  This header file must be included after all header files except
-  memdebug.h, as it does similar memory function redefinitions and can be
-  similarly affected by conflicting definitions in system or dependent
-  library headers.
+  All the existing Curl_bundle* functions were only ever used from within
+  the conncache.c file, so I moved them over and made them static (and
+  removed the Curl_ prefix).

  Source code, the man pages, the INTERNALS document, TODO, KNOWN_BUGS and the
  most recent changes in the git log. Just lurking on the curl-library mailing
  list is gonna give you a lot of insights on what's going on right now. Asking
  there is a good idea too.
 
-2. cURL Coding Standards
+2. Write a good patch
 
-2.1 Naming
+2.1 Follow code style
 
- Try using a non-confusing naming scheme for your new functions and variable
- names. It doesn't necessarily have to mean that you should use the same as in
- other places of the code, just that the names should be logical,
- understandable and be named according to what they're used for. File-local
- functions should be made static. We like lower case names.
+ When writing C code, follow the CODE_STYLE already established in the
+ project. Consistent style makes code easier to read and mistakes less likely
+ to happen.
 
- See the INTERNALS document on how we name non-exported library-global
- symbols.
-
-2.2 Indenting
-
- Use the same indenting levels and bracing method as all the other code
- already does. It makes the source code easier to follow if all of it is
- written using the same style. We don't ask you to like it, we just ask you to
- follow the tradition! ;-) This mainly means: 2-level indents, using spaces
- only (no tabs) and having the opening brace ({) on the same line as the if()
- or while().
-
- Also note that we use if() and while() with no space before the parenthesis.
-
-2.3 Commenting
-
- Comment your source code extensively using C comments (/* comment */), DO NOT
- use C++ comments (// this style). Commented code is quality code and enables
- future modifications much more. Uncommented code risk having to be completely
- replaced when someone wants to extend things, since other persons' source
- code can get quite hard to read.
-
-2.4 Line Lengths
-
- We write source lines shorter than 80 columns.
-
-2.5 General Style
-
- Keep your functions small. If they're small you avoid a lot of mistakes and
- you don't accidentally mix up variables etc.
-
-2.6 Non-clobbering All Over
+2.2 Non-clobbering All Over
 
  When you write new functionality or fix bugs, it is important that you don't
  fiddle all over the source files and functions. Remember that it is likely
  that other people have done changes in the same source files as you have and
  possibly even in the same functions. If you bring completely new
  functionality, try writing it in a new source file. If you fix bugs, try to
  fix one bug at a time and send them as separate patches.
 
-2.7 Platform Dependent Code
-
- Use #ifdef HAVE_FEATURE to do conditional code. We avoid checking for
- particular operating systems or hardware in the #ifdef lines. The
- HAVE_FEATURE shall be generated by the configure script for unix-like systems
- and they are hard-coded in the config-[system].h files for the others.
-
-2.8 Write Separate Patches
+2.3 Write Separate Patches
 
  It is annoying when you get a huge patch from someone that is said to fix 511
  odd problems, but discussions and opinions don't agree with 510 of them - or
  509 of them were already fixed in a different way. Then the patcher needs to
  extract the single interesting patch from somewhere within the huge pile of
  source, and that gives a lot of extra work. Preferably, all fixes that

  description exactly what they correct so that all patches can be selectively
  applied by the maintainer or other interested parties.
 
  Also, separate patches enable bisecting much better when we track problems in
  the future.
 
-2.9 Patch Against Recent Sources
+2.4 Patch Against Recent Sources
 
  Please try to get the latest available sources to make your patches
  against. It makes the life of the developers so much easier. The very best is
  if you get the most up-to-date sources from the git repository, but the
  latest release archive is quite OK as well!
 
-2.10 Document
+2.5 Document
 
  Writing docs is dead boring and one of the big problems with many open source

The command is designed to work without user interaction. 
 <p class="level0">curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume, Metalink, and more. As you will see below, the number of features will make your head spin!

 <p class="level0">The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed description in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986</a>.

You can limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the <a class="emphasis" href="#--max-redirs">--max-redirs</a> option. 
 <p class="level1">When curl follows a redirect and the request is not a plain GET (for example POST or PUT), it will do the following request with a GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303.

 If `CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION` is set to `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0`, libcurl will use

 an option that will cause libcurl to fail if not possible to use HTTP/2.

+`CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS` was added in 7.47.0 as a way to ask libcurl to prefer

 ALPN is the TLS extension that HTTP/2 is expected to use. The NPN extension is
 for a similar purpose, was made prior to ALPN and is used for SPDY so early
 HTTP/2 servers are implemented using NPN before ALPN support is widespread.

 Alt-Svc is a suggested extension with a corresponding frame (ALTSVC) in HTTP/2

 <p class="level1">A redirect to a file: URL would cause the libcurl to read (or write) arbitrary files from the local filesystem.  If the application returns the data back to the user (as would happen in some kinds of CGI scripts), an attacker could leverage this to read otherwise forbidden data (e.g. file://localhost/etc/passwd).

A redirect such as <a href="ftp://some-internal-server/private-file">ftp://some-internal-server/private-file</a> would then return data even when the server is password protected.

Apps can mitigate against this by setting a <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION(3)</span> and checking the address before a connection.

 CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_TLS_SESSION,
                            struct curl_tlssessioninfo **session);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-Pass a pointer to a 'struct curl_tlssessioninfo *'.  The pointer will be
-initialized to refer to a 'struct curl_tlssessioninfo *' that will contain an
-enum indicating the SSL library used for the handshake and the respective
-internal TLS session structure of this underlying SSL library.
+\fBThis option has been superseded\fP by \fICURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR(3)\fP which
+was added in 7.48.0. The only reason you would use this option instead is if
+you could be using a version of libcurl earlier than 7.48.0.
 
-This may then be used to extract certificate information in a format
-convenient for further processing, such as manual validation. NOTE: this
-option may not be available for all SSL backends; unsupported SSL backends
-will always return NULL in the \fIinternals\fP pointer to indicate that they
-are not supported.
+This option is exactly the same as \fICURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR(3)\fP except in the
+case of OpenSSL. If the session \fIbackend\fP is CURLSSLBACKEND_OPENSSL the
+session \fIinternals\fP pointer varies depending on the option:
 
-.nf
-struct curl_tlssessioninfo {
-  curl_sslbackend backend;
-  void *internals;
-};
-.fi
+CURLINFO_TLS_SESSION OpenSSL session \fIinternals\fP is SSL_CTX *.
 
-The \fIbackend\fP struct member is one of the defines in the CURLSSLBACKEND_*
-series: CURLSSLBACKEND_NONE (when built without TLS support),
-CURLSSLBACKEND_OPENSSL, CURLSSLBACKEND_GNUTLS, CURLSSLBACKEND_NSS,
-CURLSSLBACKEND_GSKIT, CURLSSLBACKEND_POLARSSL, CURLSSLBACKEND_CYASSL,
-CURLSSLBACKEND_SCHANNEL, CURLSSLBACKEND_DARWINSSL or
-CURLSSLBACKEND_AXTLS. (Note that the OpenSSL forks are all reported as just
-OpenSSL here.)
+CURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR OpenSSL session \fIinternals\fP is SSL *.
 
-The \fIinternals\fP struct member will point to a TLS library specific pointer
-with the following underlying types:
-.RS
-.IP OpenSSL
-SSL_CTX *
-.IP GnuTLS
-gnutls_session_t
-.IP NSS
-PRFileDesc *
-.IP gskit
-gsk_handle
-.RE
+You can obtain an SSL_CTX pointer from an SSL pointer using OpenSSL function
+SSL_get_SSL_CTX. Therefore unless you need compatibility with older versions of
+libcurl use \fICURLINFO_TLS_SSL_PTR(3)\fP. Refer to that document for more
+information.

+This instructs libcurl to NOT squash sequences of "/../" or "/./" that may

+RFC 3986 section 5.2.4.
 
 Some server implementations are known to (erroneously) require the dot dot
 sequences to remain in the path and some clients want to pass these on in
 order to try out server implementations.
 
 By default libcurl will merge such sequences before using the path.

 <p class="level0"><a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS.html">CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS</a> can be used to limit what protocols libcurl will use for this transfer, independent of what libcurl has been compiled to support.

For example:

 <p class="level0">The port is optional and when not specified libcurl will use the default port based on the determined or specified protocol: 80 for HTTP, 21 for FTP and 25 for SMTP, etc. The following examples show how to specify the port:

 Certificate Verification with NSS
 ---------------------------------
 
 If libcurl was built with NSS support, then depending on the OS distribution,
 it is probably required to take some additional steps to use the system-wide
 CA cert db. RedHat ships with an additional module, libnsspem.so, which
-enables NSS to read the OpenSSL PEM CA bundle. This library is missing in
-OpenSuSE, and without it, NSS can only work with its own internal formats. NSS
+enables NSS to read the OpenSSL PEM CA bundle. On openSUSE you can install
+p11-kit-nss-trust which makes NSS use the system wide CA certificate store. NSS
 also has a new [database format](https://wiki.mozilla.org/NSS_Shared_DB).
 
 Starting with version 7.19.7, libcurl automatically adds the 'sql:' prefix to
 the certdb directory (either the hardcoded default /etc/pki/nssdb or the
 directory configured with SSL_DIR environment variable). To check which certdb
 format your distribution provides, examine the default certdb location:

+
+ A test suite made for HTTP cookies (RFC 6265) by Adam Barth is available at
+ https://github.com/abarth/http-state/tree/master/tests
+
+ It'd be really awesome if someone would write a script/setup that would run
+ curl with that test suite and detect deviances. Ideally, that would even be
+ incorporated into our regular test suite.

+## ------ ##
+## Usage. ##
+## ------ ##
+
+# This file is a library for parsing options in your shell scripts along
+# with assorted other useful supporting features that you can make use
+# of too.
+#
+# For the simplest scripts you might need only:
+#
+#   #!/bin/sh
+#   . relative/path/to/funclib.sh
+#   . relative/path/to/options-parser
+#   scriptversion=1.0
+#   func_options ${1+"$@"}
+#   eval set dummy "$func_options_result"; shift
+#   ...rest of your script...
+#
+# In order for the '--version' option to work, you will need to have a
+# suitably formatted comment like the one at the top of this file
+# starting with '# Written by ' and ending with '# warranty; '.
+#
+# For '-h' and '--help' to work, you will also need a one line
+# description of your script's purpose in a comment directly above the
+# '# Written by ' line, like the one at the top of this file.
+#
+# The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
+# execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
+# use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
+# to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
+# '--verbose'.
+#
+# After sourcing this file, you can plug processing for additional
+# options by amending the variables from the 'Configuration' section
+# below, and following the instructions in the 'Option parsing'
+# section further down.
+
+## -------------- ##
+## Configuration. ##
+## -------------- ##
+
+# You should override these variables in your script after sourcing this
+# file so that they reflect the customisations you have added to the
+# option parser.
+
+# The usage line for option parsing errors and the start of '-h' and
+# '--help' output messages. You can embed shell variables for delayed
+# expansion at the time the message is displayed, but you will need to

+# expanded when the contents are evaled.
+usage='$progpath [OPTION]...'

+# override it after sourcing this library to reflect the full set of

    These project files are a recent addition to the curl source code and as such
    are not 100% complete. This is a list of things that are still todo:
 
    * Support zlib
    * Use of static runtime libraries
-   * Generate *.vcxproj.filters files for VC10, VC11 and VC12
    * Add the Test Suite components
    * Support for other development IDEs
    * Add PATH environment variables for third-party DLLs
 
    Any additional help would be appreciated ;-)
