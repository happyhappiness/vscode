-  Most notable the security advisory:
-  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20130412.html
+  Security problem: CVE-2013-2174
+  
+  If a program would give a string like "%FF" to curl_easy_unescape() but
+  ask for it to decode only the first byte, it would still parse and
+  decode the full hex sequence. The function then not only read beyond the
+  allowed buffer but it would also deduct the *unsigned* counter variable
+  for how many more bytes there's left to read in the buffer by two,
+  making the counter wrap. Continuing this, the function would go on
+  reading beyond the buffer and soon writing beyond the allocated target
+  buffer...

+- Use opened body.out file and write content to it.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Jun 2013)
+- multi_socket: react on socket close immediately
   
-  ... and make 1216 also verify it with a file input
+  As a remedy to the problem when a socket gets closed and a new one is
+  opened with the same file descriptor number and as a result
+  multi.c:singlesocket() doesn't detect the difference, the new function
+  Curl_multi_closed() gets told when a socket is closed so that it can be
+  removed from the socket hash. When the old one has been removed, a new
+  socket should be detected fine by the singlesocket() on next invoke.
   
-  These tests verify commit 3604fde3d3c9b0d, the fix for the "cookie
-  domain tailmatch" vulnerability. See

-  When doing PWD, there's a 257 response which apparently some servers

-  otherwise the norm.
+  When curl_multi_wait() finds no file descriptor to wait for, it returns

-- darwinssl: disable insecure ciphers by default
+- cert_stuff: avoid double free in the PKCS12 code
   
-  I noticed that aria2's SecureTransport code disables insecure ciphers such
-  as NULL, anonymous, IDEA, and weak-key ciphers used by SSLv3 and later.
-  That's a good idea, and now we do the same thing in order to prevent curl
-  from accessing a "secure" site that only negotiates insecure ciphersuites.
+  In the pkcs12 code, we get a list of x509 records returned from
+  PKCS12_parse but when iterating over the list and passing each to
+  SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert() we didn't also properly remove them from
+  the "stack", which made them get freed twice (both in sk_X509_pop_free()
+  and then later in SSL_CTX_free).
+  
+  This isn't really documented anywhere...

-  proxy: make ConnectionExists() check credential of proxyconnections too
+- lib1500: remove bad check
   
-  Previously it only compared credentials if the requested needle
-  connection wasn't using a proxy. This caused NTLM authentication
-  failures when using proxies as the authentication code wasn't send on
-  the connection where the challenge arrived.
+  After curl_multi_wait() returns, this test checked that we got exactly

+  true. curl_multi_wait() will sometimes return earlier without any file
+  descriptor to handle, just just because it is a suitable time to call
+  *perform().
   
-  Added test 1215 to verify: NTLM server authentication through a proxy

+  commit 29bf0598aad5 introduced a problem when the "internal" timeout is
+  prefered to the given if shorter, as it didn't consider the case where
+  -1 was returned. Now the internal timeout is only considered if not -1.

-  cookie.c: Made cookie sort function more deterministic
+Dan Fandrich (3 Jun 2013)
+- libcurl-tutorial.3: added a section on IPv6
   
-  Since qsort implementations vary with regards to handling the order
-  of similiar elements, this change makes the internal sort function
-  more deterministic by comparing path length first, then domain length
-  and finally the cookie name. Spotted with testcase 62 on Windows.
+  Also added a (correctly-escaped) backslash to the autoexec.bat
+  example file and a new Windows character device name with
+  a colon as examples of other characters that are special
+  and potentially dangerous (this reverts and reworks commit
+  7d8d2a54).

-- ftp tests: libcurl returns CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_FAILED better now
+  ossl_send: SSL_write() returning 0 is an error too
   
-  Since commit 57aeabcc1a20f, it handles errors on the control connection
-  while waiting for the data connection better.
+  We found that in specific cases if the connection is abruptly closed,
+  the underlying socket is listed in a close_wait state. We continue to
+  call the curl_multi_perform, curl_mutli_fdset etc. None of these APIs
+  report the socket closed / connection finished.  Since we have cases
+  where the multi connection is only used once, this can pose a problem
+  for us. I've read that if another connection was to come in, curl would
+  see the socket as bad and attempt to close it at that time -
+  unfortunately, this does not work for us.
   
-  Test 591 and 592 are updated accordingly.
+  I found that in specific situations, if SSL_write returns 0, curl did
+  not recognize the socket as closed (or errored out) and did not report
+  it to the application. I believe we need to change the code slightly, to
+  check if ssl_write returns 0. If so, treat it as an error - the same as
+  a negative return code.

+  For OpenSSL - the ssl_write documentation is here:

-- FTP: wait on both connections during active STOR state
+- KNOWN_BUGS: curl -OJC- fails to resume

+
+- Curl_cookie_add: handle IPv6 hosts
   
-  This flaw caused active connections to become unnecessary slow but they
-  would still often work due to the normal polling on a timeout. The bug
-  also would not occur if the server connected back very fast, like when
-  testing on local networks.
+  1 - don't skip host names with a colon in them in an attempt to bail out

+  cookies: only consider full path matches
   
-  cURL attempts to connect to the IPv6 address first.
+  I found a bug which cURL sends cookies to the path not to aim at.
+  For example:
+  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hoge/
+  - server returns cookie which with path=/hoge;
+    the point is there is NOT the '/' end of path string.
+  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hogege/ with the cookie.
   
-  bindlocal (in lib/connect.c) fails because Curl_if2ip cannot find an
-  IPv6 address on the interface.
+  The reason for this old "feature" is because that behavior is what is
+  described in the original netscape cookie spec:
+  http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html
   
-  This is a fatal error in singleipconnect()

+  The function wrongly checked for the CURLOPT_PROXY variable to be set,
+  which made it act wrongly if the proxy information was set with an
+  environment variable.
+  
+  Added test case 711 to verify (based on 707 which uses --socks5). Also

+- test709: clarify the test in the name
 
-- WIN32 MemoryTracking: track wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() usage
+- sshserver: disable StrictHostKeyChecking
   
-  As of 25-mar-2013 wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() are only used in
-  WIN32 specific code, so tracking of these has not been extended for
-  other build targets. Without this fix, memory tracking system on
-  WIN32 builds, when using these functions, would provide misleading
-  results.
+  I couldn't figure out why the host key logic isn't working, but having
+  it set to yes prevents my SSH-based test cases to run. I also don't see
+  a strong need to use strict host key checking on this test server.
   
-  In order to properly extend this support for all targets curl.h
-  would have to define curl_wcsdup_callback prototype and consequently
-  wchar_t should be visible before that in curl.h.  IOW curl_wchar_t
-  defined in curlbuild.h and this pulling whatever system header is
-  required to get wchar_t definition.
+  So I disabled it.
+
+- runtests: log more commands in verbose mode
   
-  Additionally a new curl_global_init_mem() function that also receives
-  user defined wcsdup() callback would be required.
+  ... to aid tracking down failures

+- url: Fixed missing length check in parse_proxy()
   
-  Corrected some incorrectly positioned pointer variable declarations to

+  old scanf() code.
 
-- multi.c: Corrected a couple of violations of the curl coding standards
+- url: Fixed crash when no username or password supplied for proxy
   
-  Corrected some incorrectly positioned pointer variable declarations to

+  Fixed an issue in parse_proxy(), introduced in commit 11332577b3cb,
+  where an empty username or password (For example: http://:@example.com)

-  turned off until the next point release of OS X.
+  Added bounds checking when searching for the separator characters within

+- url: Added support for parsing login options from the URL
   
-  CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - A pipelined connection will not
-  be reused if it is currently processing a chunk larger than this.
+  As well as parsing the username and password from the URL, added support
+  for parsing the optional options part from the login details, to allow

+  
+  This flaw caused active connections to become unnecessary slow but they

-  - check __ILP32__ before 32 and 64bit processor architectures in

-    which, of course, also support LP64 programming model, when using

-  - keep 32bit processor architecture checks in order to support gcc
-    versions older than 4.7 which don't define __ILP32__
+  bindlocal (in lib/connect.c) fails because Curl_if2ip cannot find an
+  IPv6 address on the interface.

-  handles any responses by sending them to the client as body data.
+  As of 25-mar-2013 wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() are only used in

-  imap: Implemented APPEND final processing
+  build_vms.com: use existing curlbuild.h and parsing fix
   
-  The APPEND operation needs to be performed in several steps:
-    1) We send "<tag> APPEND <mailbox> <flags> {<size>}\r\n"
-    2) Server responds with continuation respose "+ ...\r\n"
-    3) We start the transfer and send <size> bytes of data
-    4) Only now we end the request command line by sending "\r\n"
-    5) Server responds with "<tag> OK ...\r\n"
+  This patch removes building curlbuild.h from the build_vms.com procedure
+  and uses the one in the daily or release tarball instead.
   
-  This commit performs steps 4 and 5, in the DONE phase, as more
-  processing is required after the transfer.

-- pop3: Refactored the mailbox variable as it didn't reflect it's purpose

-  imap: Added the ability to FETCH a specific UID and SECTION
+- email-tests: Renamed the IMAP test to be 800
   
-  Updated the FETCH command to send the UID and SECTION parsed from the
-  URL. By default the BODY specifier doesn't include a section, BODY[] is
-  now sent whereas BODY[TEXT] was previously sent. In my opinion
-  retrieving just the message text is rarely useful when dealing with

 - [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
 
-  pingpong: Introduce Curl_pp_moredata()
-  
-  A simple function to test whether the PP is not sending and there are
-  still more data in its receiver cache. This will be later utilized to:
-  
-  1) Change Curl_pp_multi_statemach() and Curl_pp_easy_statemach() to
-     not test socket state and just call user's statemach_act() function
-     when there are more data to process, because otherwise the task would
-     just hang, waiting for more data from the socket.
+  imap: Fixed test801 and test1321 to specify a message UID
   
-  2) Allow PP users to read multiple responses by looping as long as there
-     are more data available and current phase is not finished.
-     (Currently needed for correct processing of IMAP SELECT responses.)
+  Just a folder list would be retrieved if UID was not specified now.

-  follow-up to commit ed7174c6f66, rename 'wait' to 'block'
+  * Added support for APPEND - Saves uploaded data to log/upload.$testno
+  * Added support for LIST - Returns the contents of <reply/> section in
+    the current test, like e.g FETCH.
+  * Added support for STORE - Returns hardcoded updated flags
+  * Changed handling of SELECT - Returns much more information in the
+    usual set of untagged responses; uses hardcoded data from an example
+    in the IMAP RFC
+  * Changed handling of FETCH - Fixed response format
 
-- compiler warning fix: declaration of 'wait' shadows a global declaration
+- imap: Added check for empty UID in FETCH command
   
-  It seems older gcc installations (at least) will cause warnings if we
-  name a variable 'wait'. Now changed to 'block' instead.
+  As the UID has to be specified by the user for the FETCH command to work
+  correctly, added a check to imap_fetch(), although strictly speaking it
+  is protected by the call from imap_perform().

-  Due to the reordering of functions in commit 586f5d361474 the forward
-  declaration to state_upgrade_tls() are no longer required.
+  If the server hung up the connection without sending a closure alert,
+  then we'd keep probing the socket for data even though it's dead. Now
+  we're ready for this situation.

-- metalink_cleanup: yet another follow-up fix
+- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
 
-- metalink_cleanup: define it without argument
+  imap: Added custom request perform and response handler functions
   
-  Since the function takes no argument, the macro shouldn't take one as
-  some compilers will error out on that.
+  Added imap_custom(), which initiates the custom command processing,
+  and an associated response handler imap_state_custom_resp(), which

+  
+  All untagged responses with the same name as the first word of the

-  Remove tailing whitespace introduced in commit 7ed689d24a4e.
+  Introduced the result code variable to simplify the state changes and
+  remove the hard returns.
 
-- pop3: Fixed blocking SSL connect when connecting via POP3S
+- imap: Changed successful response logic in imap_state_append_resp()
   
-  A call to Curl_ssl_connect() was accidentally left in when the SSL/TLS
-  connection layer was reworked in 7.29. Not only would this cause the
-  connection to block but had the additional overhead of calling the
-  non-blocking connect a little bit later.
+  For consistency changed the logic of the imap_state_append_resp()
+  function to test for an unsucessful continuation response rather than a
+  succesful one.
 
-- smtp: Refactored the smtp_state_auth_resp() function
+- imap: Standardised imapcode condition tests
   
-  Renamed smtp_state_auth_resp() function to match the implementations in

+- imap: Moved imap_append() to be with the other perform functions
 
-- strlcat: remove function
-  
-  This function was only used twice, both in places where performance
-  isn't crucial (socks + if2ip). Removing the use of this function removes
-  the need to have our private version for systems without it == reduced
-  amount of code.
-  
-  Also, in the SOCKS case it is clearly better to fail gracefully rather
-  than to truncate the results.
-  
-  This work was triggered by a bug report on the strcal prototype in
-  strequal.h.
-  
-  strlcat was added in commit db70cd28 in February 2001!

-  commit ad7291c1a9d), it is now renamed to formboundary() and is made
-  static.
+  Added logic in imap_perform() to perform an APPEND rather than SELECT
+  and FETCH if an upload has been specified.
 
-- ossl_seed: fix the last resort PRNG seeding
-  
-  Instead of just abusing the pseudo-randomizer from Curl_FormBoundary(),

-- email: Tidy up before additional IMAP work
+  imap: Implemented APPEND final processing
   
-  Replaced two explicit comparisons of CURLE_OK with boolean alternatives.
+  The APPEND operation needs to be performed in several steps:
+    1) We send "<tag> APPEND <mailbox> <flags> {<size>}\r\n"
+    2) Server responds with continuation respose "+ ...\r\n"
+    3) We start the transfer and send <size> bytes of data
+    4) Only now we end the request command line by sending "\r\n"
+    5) Server responds with "<tag> OK ...\r\n"
   
-  General tidy up of comments.
+  This commit performs steps 4 and 5, in the DONE phase, as more
+  processing is required after the transfer.
 
-- smtp: Removed duplicate pingpong structure initialisation

+- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
+
+  imap: Updated setting of transfer variables in imap_state_fetch_resp()
   
-  Version 7.29.0 uses Makefiles generated with a newer version of the
-  autotools than the previous 7.28.1. These Makefiles try to install
-  e.g. header files by calling install-sh with multiple source files as
-  arguments. The bundled install-sh is to old and does not support this.
+  Add number of bytes retrieved from the PP cache to req.bytecount and set
+  req.maxdownload only when starting a proper download.
+
+- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
+
+  imap: Improved FETCH response parsing
   
-  The problem only occurs, if install-sh is actually being used, ie. the
-  platform install executable is to old or not usable. Example: Solaris
-  10.
+  Added safer parsing of the untagged FETCH response line and the size of
+  continuation data.
+
+- imap: Fixed accidentally lossing the result code
   
-  The files install-sh and mkinstalldirs are now updated with the automake
-  1.11.3 versions. A better fix might be to completely remove them from
-  git and force the files to be added/created during buildconf.

+  imap: Fixed error code returned for invalid FETCH response
   
-  An ambiguity in the SSLWrite() documentation lead to a bad inference in the
-  code where we assumed SSLWrite() returned the amount of bytes written to
-  the socket, when that is not actually true; it returns the amount of data
-  that is buffered for writing to the socket if it returns errSSLWouldBlock.
-  Now darwinssl_send() returns CURLE_AGAIN if data is buffered but not written.

+  A typical FETCH response can be broken down into four parts:
   
-  Additionally changed the int return type to bool as this is more

+    1) "* <uid> FETCH (<what> {<size>}\r\n", using continuation syntax
+    2) <size> bytes of the actual message
+    3) ")\r\n", finishing the untagged response

-- DONE: consider callback-aborted transfers premature
-  
-  This bug report properly identified that when doing SMTP and aborting
-  the transfer with a callback, it must be considered aborted prematurely
-  by the code to avoid QUIT etc to be attempted as that would cause a
-  hang.
+- smtp: Removed bytecountp from the per-request structure
   
-  The new test case 1507 verifies this behavior.
+  Removed this pointer to a downloaded bytes counter because it was set in
+  smtp_init() to point to the same variable the transfer functions keep
+  the count in (k->bytecount), effectively making the code in transfer.c
+  "*k->bytecountp = k->bytecount" a no-op.

-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message: fix buffer overflow
+- DOCS: Corrected layout of POP3 and IMAP URL examples
   
-  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
-  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
-  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.
+  Corrected layout issues with the POP3 and IMAP URL examples introduced
+  in commit cb3ae6894fb2.
+
+- DOCS: Updated CURLOPT_URL section following recent POP3 and IMAP changes
   
-  This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a
-  server that a libcurl based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or
-  IMAP. For applications that accept user provided URLs, it is also
-  thinkable that a malicious user would feed an application with a URL to
-  a server hosting code targetting this flaw.
+  Updated the POP3 sub-section to refer to message ID rather than mailbox.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20130206.html
+  Added an IMAP sub-section with example URLs depicting the specification
+  of mailbox, uid and section.

+  name mailbox was a leftover from when IMAP and POP3 support was

+  now sent whereas BODY[TEXT] was previously sent. In my opinion
+  retrieving just the message text is rarely useful when dealing with

+- remove ifdefs
   
-  When running a configure script that has nested packages (for example
-  libcurl's configure with --enable-ares and c-ares sources embedded in
-  curl tree) and AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([nested-subdir]) machinery is used to
-  automatically run the nested configure script from within the parent
-  configure script, it happens that the nested _shell_ script will
-  inherit shell variables exported from the parent _shell_ script.
+  Clarify the code by reducing ifdefs
+
+- strlcat: remove function
   
-  If for example parent configure script sets and exports LDFLAGS and LIBS
-  variables with proper values in order to link either a parent library or
-  program with a library which will be configured and built by a nested
-  package; It will happen that when the nested configure script runs, the
-  nested library does not exist yet and _any_ link-test done in the nested
-  configure will fail, such as those that autoconf macros perform in order
-  to detect existing compiler and its characteristics, the result is that
-  the nested configure script will fail with errors such as:
+  This function was only used twice, both in places where performance
+  isn't crucial (socks + if2ip). Removing the use of this function removes
+  the need to have our private version for systems without it == reduced
+  amount of code.
   
-  configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
+  Also, in the SOCKS case it is clearly better to fail gracefully rather
+  than to truncate the results.
   
-  For now, we no longer export variables previously exported here.
+  This work was triggered by a bug report on the strcal prototype in
+  strequal.h.
   
-  On the other hand, AC_SUBST'ing them is appropriate and even with nested
-  packages each package's config.status gets its own package values.
+  strlcat was added in commit db70cd28 in February 2001!
   
-  So we reinstate AC_SUBST'ing previously AC_SUBST'ed variables.

+
+- smtp: Added support for the STLS capability (Part One)
   
-  NSS caches certs/keys returned by the SSL_GetClientAuthDataHook callback
-  and if we connect second time to the same server, the cached cert/key
-  pair is used.  If we use multiple client certificates for different
-  paths on the same server, we need to clear the session cache to force
-  NSS to call the hook again.  The commit 052a08ff prevented the session

+  ntlm: fix memory leak
   
-  Removes the need and presence of an alarming notice we carried
-  in old setup_once.h [2]
+  Running tests\libtest\libntlmconnect.exe reveals a 1 byte (!) leak in
+  ./lib/curl_ntlm_msgs.c:
   
-  ----------------------------------------
+  perl ..\memanalyze.pl c:memdebug.curl
+  Leak detected: memory still allocated: 1 bytes
+  At 9771e8, there's 1 bytes.
+  allocated by curl_ntlm_msgs.c:399
   
-  1 - lib/setup_once.h used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro as header inclusion guard
-      up to commit ec691ca3 which changed this to HEADER_CURL_SETUP_ONCE_H,
-      this single inclusion guard is enough to ensure that inclusion of
-      lib/setup_once.h done from lib/setup.h is only done once.
+  Snippet from curl_ntlm_msgs.c:
+     /* setup ntlm identity's domain and length */
+     dup_domain.tchar_ptr = malloc(sizeof(TCHAR) * (domlen + 1));
   
-      Additionally lib/setup.h has always used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro to
-      protect inclusion of setup_once.h even after commit ec691ca3, this
-      was to avoid a circular header inclusion triggered when building a
-      c-ares enabled version with c-ares sources available which also has
-      a setup_once.h header. Commit ec691ca3 exposes the real nature of
-      __SETUP_ONCE_H usage in lib/setup.h, it is a header inclusion guard
-      foreign to libcurl belonging to c-ares's setup_once.h
+  (my domlen == 0).
   
-      The renaming this commit does, fixes the circular header inclusion,
-      and as such removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard
-      foreign to libcurl. Macro __SETUP_ONCE_H no longer used in libcurl.
+  'dup_domain.tbyte_ptr' looks to be freed in Curl_ntlm_sspi_cleanup() via
+  'ntlm->identity.Domain'. But I see no freeing of 'dup_domain.tchar_ptr'.
+
+- DONE: consider callback-aborted transfers premature
   
-  2 - Due to the circular interdependency of old lib/setup_once.h and the
-      c-ares setup_once.h header, old file lib/setup_once.h has carried
-      back from 2006 up to now days an alarming and prominent notice about
-      the need of keeping libcurl's and c-ares's setup_once.h in sync.
+  This bug report properly identified that when doing SMTP and aborting
+  the transfer with a callback, it must be considered aborted prematurely
+  by the code to avoid QUIT etc to be attempted as that would cause a
+  hang.
   
-      Given that this commit fixes the circular interdependency, the need
-      and presence of mentioned notice is removed.
+  The new test case 1507 verifies this behavior.
   
-      All mentioned interdependencies come back from now old days when
-      the c-ares project lived inside a curl subdirectory. This commit
-      removes last traces of such fact.

+  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function

+  
+  This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a

+  VMS: fix and generate the VMS build config
   
-    http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-01/0012.html
+  config_h.com is a new file that generates a config.h file based on the
+  curl_config.h.in file and a quick scan of the configure script.  This is
+  actually a generic procedure that is shared with other VMS packages.
   
-  Asking for confirmation on pushing this revertion commit:
+  The existing pre-built config-vms.h had over 100 entries that were not
+  correct and in some cases conflicted with the build options available in
+  the build_vms.com.
   
-    http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-01/0048.html
+  generate_config_vms_h_curl.com is a helper procedure to the
+  config_h.com.  It covers the cases that the generic config_h.com is not
+  able to figure out, and accepts input from the build_vms.com procedure.
   
-  Confirmation summary:
+  build_curlbuild_h.com is a new file to generate the curlbuild.h file
+  that Curl is now using when it is using a curl_config.h file.
   
-    http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-01/0079.html
+  post-config-vms.h is a new file that is needed to provide VMS specific
+  definitions, and most of them need to be set before the system header
+  files are included.
   
-  NOTICE: The list of 2 files that have been modified by other
-  intermixed commits, while renamed, and also by at least one
-  of the 6 commits this one reverts follows below. These 2 files
-  will exhibit a hole in history unless git's '--follow' option
-  is used when viewing logs.
+  The VMS build procedure is fixed:
   
-    lib/curl_imap.h
-    lib/curl_smtp.h
+     1. Fixed to link in the correct HP ssl library.
+     2. Fixed to detect if HP Kerberos is installed.
+     3. Fixed to detect if HP LDAP is installed.
+     4. Fixed to detect if gnv$libzshr is installed.
+     5. Simplified the input parameter parsing to not use a loop.
+     6. Warn that 64 bit pointer option support is not complete
+        in comments.
+     7. Default to IEEE floating if platform supports it so
+        resulting libcurl will be compatible with other
+        open source projects on VMS.
+     8. Default to LARGEFILE if platform supports it.
+     9. Default to enable SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, libz
+        if the libraries are present.
+     10. Build with exact case global symbols for libcurl.

-- mk-ca-bundle.1: convert syntax to what's used elsewhere
+- Curl_proxyCONNECT: return once CONNECT is sent
   
-  ... mostly to make sure roffit works better on it, but also to make our
-  man pages use a more unified style.
-
-- mk-ca-bundle.1: mention new -f, fix outputfile output
+  By doing this unconditionally, we infer a simpler and more defined
+  behavior. This also has the upside that test 1021 no longer fails for me
+  even if I run with valgrind.
   
-  also edited a few sentences to become more verbose
+  Also fixed some wrong comments.
 
-- mk-ca-bundle: add -f, support passing to stdout and more
-  
-  1. When the downloaded data file from Mozilla is current, but the output
-  bundle does not exist: continue processing to create the bundle.  The
-  goal is to have the output file - not just download the latest input.
+Steve Holme (5 Feb 2013)
+- email: Reworked comments in the endofresp() functions
   
-  2. added -f option to force re-processing the file.  Useful for
-  debugging/testing the process.
+  Tidied up the comments in the endofresp() functions to be more
+  meaningful prior to release.
+
+Marc Hoersken (5 Feb 2013)
+- schannel: Removed extended error connection setup flag
   
-  3. added support for output to '-' (stdout), allowing the output to be
-  piped.
+  According KB975858 this flag may cause problems on Windows 7 and
+  Windows Server 2008 R2 systems. Extended error information is not
+  currently used by libcurl and therefore not a requirement.
   
-  4. All progress and error messages go to STDERR rather than STDOUT (3)
+  The flag may improve the SSL-connection shutdown in case of an
+  error. This means it might be a good improvement in the future.
   
-  5. The script opened and closed the output file many times
-  unnecessarily.  It now opens it once, does the output and closes it.
+  Fixes bug/issue #1187 - thanks for the report

+- xc-cc-check.m4: re-evaluate exporting and AC_SUBST'ing vars
+  
+  Notes:
+  
+  When running a configure script that has nested packages (for example
+  libcurl's configure with --enable-ares and c-ares sources embedded in
+  curl tree) and AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([nested-subdir]) machinery is used to
+  automatically run the nested configure script from within the parent
+  configure script, it happens that the nested _shell_ script will
+  inherit shell variables exported from the parent _shell_ script.
+  
+  If for example parent configure script sets and exports LDFLAGS and LIBS
+  variables with proper values in order to link either a parent library or
+  program with a library which will be configured and built by a nested
+  package; It will happen that when the nested configure script runs, the
+  nested library does not exist yet and _any_ link-test done in the nested
+  configure will fail, such as those that autoconf macros perform in order
+  to detect existing compiler and its characteristics, the result is that
+  the nested configure script will fail with errors such as:
+  
+  configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
+  
+  For now, we no longer export variables previously exported here.
+  
+  On the other hand, AC_SUBST'ing them is appropriate and even with nested
+  packages each package's config.status gets its own package values.
+  
+  So we reinstate AC_SUBST'ing previously AC_SUBST'ed variables.

-  configure: fix cross pkg-config detection
+- always-multi: always use non-blocking internals
   
-  When cross-compiling, CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG was checking for the cross
-  pkg-config using ${host}-pkg-config.
+  Remove internal separated behavior of the easy vs multi intercace.
+  curl_easy_perform() is now using the multi interface itself.
   
-  The gold standard for doing this correctly is pkg-config's own macro,
-  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG.  However, on the assumption that you have a good
-  reason not to use that directly (reduced dependencies for maintainer
-  builds?), the behaviour of cURL's version should at least match.
-  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG uses AC_PATH_TOOL, which ultimately ends up trying
-  ${host_alias}-pkg-config; this is not quite the same as what cURL does,
-  and may differ because ${host} has been run through config.sub.  For
-  instance, when cross-building to the armhf architecture on Ubuntu,
-  ${host_alias} is arm-linux-gnueabihf while ${host} is
-  arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.  This may also have been the cause of the
-  problem reported at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0224.html.
+  Several minor multi interface quirks and bugs have been fixed in the
+  process.
   
-  AC_PATH_TOOL is significantly simpler than cURL's current code, and
-  dates back to well before the current minimum of Autoconf 2.57, so let's
-  use it instead.

-  Introducing a new persistent connection caching system using "bundles".
+Yang Tse (17 Jan 2013)
+- url.c: fix HTTP CONNECT tunnel establishment upon delayed response
   
-  A bundle is a list of all persistent connections to the same host.
-  The connection cache consists of a hash of bundles, with the
-  hostname as the key.
-  The benefits may not be obvious, but they are two:
+  Fixes initial proxy response being processed by the tunneled protocol
+  handler instead of the HTTP wrapper handler. This issue would trigger
+  upon delayed CONNECT response from the proxy.
   
-  1) Faster search for connections to reuse, since the hash
-     lookup only finds connections to the host in question.
-  2) It lays out the groundworks for an upcoming patch,
-     which will introduce multiple HTTP pipelines.
+  Additionally fixes a multi interface code-path in which connections
+  would not time out properly.
   
-  This patch also removes the awkward list of "closure handles",
-  which were needed to send QUIT commands to the FTP server
-  when closing a connection.
-  Now we allocate a separate closure handle and use that
-  one to close all connections.
+  This does not fix known bug #39.
   
-  This has been tested in a live system for a few weeks, and of
-  course passes the test suite.

+      a setup_once.h header. Commit ec691ca3 exposes the real nature of
+      __SETUP_ONCE_H usage in lib/setup.h, it is a header inclusion guard

-  Do not mix CRLF and LF header endings in a couple of HTTP tests
+      The renaming this commit does, fixes the circular header inclusion,
+      and as such removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard
+      foreign to libcurl. Macro __SETUP_ONCE_H no longer used in libcurl.
   
-  Consistently use CRLF instead. The mixed endings weren't
-  documented so I assume they were unintentional.
+  2 - Due to the circular interdependency of old lib/setup_once.h and the
+      c-ares setup_once.h header, old file lib/setup_once.h has carried
+      back from 2006 up to now days an alarming and prominent notice about
+      the need of keeping libcurl's and c-ares's setup_once.h in sync.
   
-  This change doesn't matter for curl itself but makes using
-  the tests with a proxy between curl and the test server
-  more convenient.
+      Given that this commit fixes the circular interdependency, the need
+      and presence of mentioned notice is removed.
   
-  Tests that consistently use no carriage returns were
-  left unmodified as one can easily work around this.
+      All mentioned interdependencies come back from now old days when
+      the c-ares project lived inside a curl subdirectory. This commit
+      removes last traces of such fact.

-  When nothing is told to configure, we should not enforce switching off

-  that situaion and therefore allow the user's CFLAGS settings possibly
-  dictate what to do.

-  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=100976&aid=3578163&group_id=976
+  1. When the downloaded data file from Mozilla is current, but the output
+  bundle does not exist: continue processing to create the bundle.  The
+  goal is to have the output file - not just download the latest input.
+  
+  2. added -f option to force re-processing the file.  Useful for
+  debugging/testing the process.
+  
+  3. added support for output to '-' (stdout), allowing the output to be
+  piped.
+  
+  4. All progress and error messages go to STDERR rather than STDOUT (3)
+  
+  5. The script opened and closed the output file many times
+  unnecessarily.  It now opens it once, does the output and closes it.
+  
+  6. Backup of the input files happens after successful processing, not
+  before.
+  
+  7. The output is written to a temporary file, and renamed to the
+  requested name after backup - this greatly reduces the window where the
+  file can be seen partially written.
+  
+  8. all die calls have a \n at the end to suppress perl's traceback - the
+  traceback isn't useful to end users.

-  CyaSSL:
+  ----------------------------------------
+
+- build: make use of 93 lib/*.c renamed files
   
-  CyaSSL now also has the RFC2818 checks enabled by default. There is a
-  limitation that the verifyhost can not be enabled exclusively on the
-  Subject CN field comparison. This SSL backend will thus behave like the
-  NSS and the GnuTLS (meaning: RFC2818 ok, or bust). In other words:
-  setting verifyhost to 0 or 1 will disable the Subject Alt Names checks
-  too.
+  93 *.c source files renamed to use our standard naming scheme.
   
-  Schannel:
+  This change affects 77 files in libcurl's source tree.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (3 Jan 2013)
+- INSTALL: unify the SSL library texts
   
-  Updated the schannel information messages: Split the IP address usage
-  message from the verifyhost setting and changed the message about
-  disabling SNI (Server Name Indication, used in HTTP virtual hosting)
-  into a message stating that the Subject Alternative Names checks are
-  being disabled when verifyhost is set to 0 or 1. As a side effect of
-  switching off the RFC2818 related servername checks with
-  SCH_CRED_NO_SERVERNAME_CHECK
-  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa923430.aspx) the SNI feature
-  is being disabled. This effect is not documented in MSDN, but Wireshark
-  output clearly shows the effect (details on the libcurl maillist).
+  Make them smaller and more similar for each separate SSL library
+  supported by the configure build
+
+Yang Tse (2 Jan 2013)
+- curl_setup.h: remove redundant include guard
+
+- build and tests: curl_10char_object_name() shell function
   
-  PolarSSL:
+  lib/objnames.inc provides definition of curl_10char_object_name() shell
+  function. The intended purpose of this function is to transliterate a
+  (*.c) source file name that may be longer than 10 characters, or not,
+  into a string with at most 10 characters which may be used as an OS/400
+  object name.
   
-  Fix the prototype change in PolarSSL of ssl_set_session() and the move
-  of the peer_cert from the ssl_context to the ssl_session. Found this
-  change in the PolarSSL SVN between r1316 and r1317 where the
-  POLARSSL_VERSION_NUMBER was at 0x01010100. But to accommodate the Ubuntu
-  PolarSSL version 1.1.4 the check is to discriminate between lower then
-  PolarSSL version 1.2.0 and 1.2.0 and higher. Note: The PolarSSL SVN
-  trunk jumped from version 1.1.1 to 1.2.0.
+  Test case 1221 does unit testng of this function and also verifies
+  that it is possible to generate distinct short object names for all
+  curl and libcurl *.c source file names.
   
-  Generic:
+  lib/objnames-test.sh is the shell script used for test case 1221.
   
-  All the SSL backends are fixed and checked to work with the
-  ssl.verifyhost as a boolean, which is an internal API change.
+  tests/runtests.pl modified to accept shell script test cases.
+  
+  More details inside lib/objnames.inc and lib/objnames-test.sh
 
-- libcurl: VERSIONINFO update
+- configure.ac: replace AM_CONFIG_HEADER with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS
   
-  Since we added the curl_multi_wait function, the VERSIONINFO needed
-  updating.
+  automake 1.13 errors if AM_CONFIG_HEADER is used in configure script.
+  automake 1.13 no longer autoupdates AM_CONFIG_HEADER to
+  AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, thing which automake has been doing since automake
+  version 1.7
   
-  Reported by: Patrick Monnerat
+  Given that our first automake supported version is automake 1.7,
+  simply replacing AM_CONFIG_HEADER usage with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS seems
+  enough to yet support same automake versions.
+  
+  Dave Reisner reported issue with 1.13 and provided patch.

-- Added .def file to output.
+- curl-override.m4: provide AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR definition conditionally
   
-  Requested by Johnny Luong on the libcurl list.
+  Provide a 'traceable' AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR definition only when using
+  an autoconf version that does not provide it, instead of what we were
+  doing up to now of providing and overriding AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR for
+  all autoconf versions.

+- imap.c: Minor follow up tidy up
 
-Daniel Stenberg (8 Nov 2012)
-- [Fabian Keil brought this change]
+- imap: Code tidy up prior to adding support for the CAPABILITY command
+  
+  * Changing the order of the state machine to represent the order in
+    which commands are sent to the server.
+  
+  * Reworking the imap_endofresp() function as the FETCH response doesn't
+    include the command id and shouldn't be part of the length comparison
+    that takes into account the id string.
 
-  Fix compilation of lib1501
+- pop3_doing: Applied debug info message when function fails
+  
+  Applied the same debug message as used in smtp_doing() and imap_doing()
+  when pop3_multi_statemach() fails.
+
+- imap_doing: don't call imap_dophase_done() if already failed
+  
+  Applied the POP3 fix from commit 2897ce7dc2e1 so imap_dophase_done()
+  isn't called if imap_multi_statemach() fails.
 
-- Curl_readwrite: remove debug output
+- smtp_doing: don't call smtp_dophase_done() if already failed
   
-  The text "additional stuff not fine" text was added for debug purposes a
-  while ago, but it isn't really helping anyone and for some reason some
-  Linux distributions provide their libcurls built with debug info still
-  present and thus (far too many) users get to read this info.
+  Applied the POP3 fix from commit 2897ce7dc2e1 so smtp_dophase_done()

-- http_perhapsrewind: consider NTLM over proxy too
+- smtp.c: Added extra comments around SMTP_STOP state change
   
-  The logic previously checked for a started NTLM negotiation only for

-- URL parser: cut off '#' fragments from URLs (better)
-  
-  The existing logic only cut off the fragment from the separate 'path'

-- CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST: stop supporting the 1 value
-  
-  After a research team wrote a document[1] that found several live source
-  codes out there in the wild that misused the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
-  option thinking it was a boolean, this change now bans 1 as a value and
-  will make libcurl return error for it.
-  
-  1 was never a sensible value to use in production but was introduced
-  back in the days to help debugging. It was always documented clearly
-  this way.
-  
-  1 was never supported by all SSL backends in libcurl, so this cleanup
-  makes the treatment of it unified.
+- build: make use of 76 lib/*.h renamed files
   
-  The report's list of mistakes for this option were all PHP code and
-  while there's a binding layer between libcurl and PHP, the PHP team has
-  decided that they have an as thin layer as possible on top of libcurl so
-  they will not alter or specifically filter a 'TRUE' value for this
-  particular option. I sympathize with that position.
+  76 private header files renamed to use our standard naming scheme.

-- FTP: prevent the multi interface from blocking
-  
-  As pointed out in Bug report #3579064, curl_multi_perform() would
-  wrongly use a blocking mechanism internally for some commands which
-  could lead to for example a very long block if the LIST response never
-  showed.
-  
-  The solution was to make sure to properly continue to use the multi
-  interface non-blocking state machine.
-  
-  The new test 1501 verifies the fix.

+- setup_once.h: HP-UX <sys/socket.h> issue workaround
   
-  Since there are servers that seem to return very big encrypted

-  tool_metalink.c: Filtered resource URLs by type
+  configure: fix cross pkg-config detection
   
-  In Metalink v3, the type attribute of url element indicates the
-  type of the resource the URL points to. It can include URL to the
-  meta data, such as BitTorrent metainfo file.  In Curl, we are not
-  interested in these meta data URLs. Instead, we are only
-  interested in the HTTP and FTP URLs. This change filters out
-  non-HTTP and FTP URLs. If we don't filter out them, it will be
-  downloaded by curl and hash check will fail if hash is provided
-  and next URL will be tried. This change will cut this useless
-  network transfer.
+  When cross-compiling, CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG was checking for the cross
+  pkg-config using ${host}-pkg-config.
+  
+  The gold standard for doing this correctly is pkg-config's own macro,
+  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG.  However, on the assumption that you have a good
+  reason not to use that directly (reduced dependencies for maintainer
+  builds?), the behaviour of cURL's version should at least match.
+  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG uses AC_PATH_TOOL, which ultimately ends up trying
+  ${host_alias}-pkg-config; this is not quite the same as what cURL does,
+  and may differ because ${host} has been run through config.sub.  For
+  instance, when cross-building to the armhf architecture on Ubuntu,
+  ${host_alias} is arm-linux-gnueabihf while ${host} is
+  arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.  This may also have been the cause of the
+  problem reported at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0224.html.
+  
+  AC_PATH_TOOL is significantly simpler than cURL's current code, and
+  dates back to well before the current minimum of Autoconf 2.57, so let's
+  use it instead.

-  I suspect this is a regression introduced in commit 207cf150, included
-  since 7.24.0.
+  Generic for OpenSSL and axTLS:
   
-  Avoid showing '(nil)' as hostname in verbose output by making sure the
-  hostname fixup function is called early enough to set the pointers that
-  are used for this. The name data is set again for each request even for
-  re-used connections to handle multiple hostnames over the same
-  connection (like with proxy) or that the casing etc of the host name is
-  changed between requests (which has proven to be important at least once
-  in the past).
+  Move the hostcheck and cert_hostcheck functions from the lib/ssluse.c
+  files to make them genericly available for both the OpenSSL, axTLS and
+  other SSL backends. They are now in the new lib/hostcheck.c file.
   
-  Test1011 was modified to use a redirect with a re-used a connection
-  since it then showed the bug and now lo longer does. There's currently
-  no easy way to have the test suite detect 'nil' texts in verbose ouputs
-  so no tests will detect if this problem gets reintroduced.

-- TODO-RELEASE: two bugs fixed
+  CyaSSL now also has the RFC2818 checks enabled by default. There is a

+  setting verifyhost to 0 or 1 will disable the Subject Alt Names checks
+  too.
+  
+  Schannel:
+  
+  Updated the schannel information messages: Split the IP address usage
+  message from the verifyhost setting and changed the message about
+  disabling SNI (Server Name Indication, used in HTTP virtual hosting)
+  into a message stating that the Subject Alternative Names checks are
+  being disabled when verifyhost is set to 0 or 1. As a side effect of
+  switching off the RFC2818 related servername checks with
+  SCH_CRED_NO_SERVERNAME_CHECK
+  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa923430.aspx) the SNI feature
+  is being disabled. This effect is not documented in MSDN, but Wireshark

+  POLARSSL_VERSION_NUMBER was at 0x01010100. But to accommodate the Ubuntu

+  PolarSSL version 1.2.0 and 1.2.0 and higher. Note: The PolarSSL SVN
+  trunk jumped from version 1.1.1 to 1.2.0.
+  
+  Generic:
   
-  These are now addressed:

-  Curl_socket_check: fix return code for timeout
-  
-  We found a problem with ftp transfer using libcurl (7.23 and 7.25)
-  inside an application which is receiving unix signals (SIGUSR1,
-  SIGUSR2...) almost continuously. (Linux 2.4, PowerPC, HAVE_POLL_FINE
-  defined).
-  
-  Curl_socket_check() uses poll() to wait for the socket, and retries it
-  when a signal is received (EINTR). However, if a signal is received and
-  it also happens that the timeout has been reached, Curl_socket_check()
-  returns -1 instead of 0 (indicating an error instead of a timeout).
+- http_perhapsrewind: consider NTLM over proxy too
   
-  In our case, the result is an aborted connection even before the ftp
-  banner is received from the server, and a return value of
-  CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY from curl_easy_perform() (Curl_pp_multi_statemach(),

-- WSAPoll: disabled on all windows builds
+- URL parser: cut off '#' fragments from URLs (better)
   
-  Due to WSAPoll bugs, libcurl does not work as intended. When the cURL
-  library is used to setup a connection to an incorrect port, normally the
-  result is CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT, /* 7 */, but due to the bug in WSAPoll,
-  the result now is CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT, /* 28 - the timeout time was
-  reached */.
+  The existing logic only cut off the fragment from the separate 'path'
+  buffer which is used when sending HTTP to hosts. The buffer that held
+  the full URL used for proxies were not dealt with. It is now.
   
-  On August 1, Jan Koen Annot opened a case for this to Microsoft Premier
-  Online (https://premier.microsoft.com/).  The support engineer handling
-  the case wrote that the case description is quite clear.  He will try to
-  reproduce the issue and then proceed with troubleshooting it.

+  Do not fill the decrypted data buffer with more data unless

-- test48: verify that HEAD doesn't close extra
-  
-  Two commits ago, we fixed a bug where the connction would be closed
-  prematurely after a HEAD. Now I added connection-monitor to test 48 and
-  added a second HEAD and make sure that both are sent over the same
-  connection.
+- curl_schannel: Removed buffer limit and optimized buffer strategy
   
-  This triggered a failure before the bug fix and now works. Will help us
-  avoid a future regression of this kind.
+  Since there are servers that seem to return very big encrypted
+  data packages, we need to be able to handle those without having
+  an internal size limit. To avoid the buffer growing to fast to
+  early the initial size was decreased and the minimum free space
+  in the buffer was decreased as well.
 
-- connection-monitor: always log disconnect when enabled
-  
-  This makes verifying easier and makes us more sure curl closes the
-  connection only at the correct point in time. Adjusted test 206 and 1008
-  accordingly and updated the docs for it.
+- lib/socks.c: Merged two size variables into one
 
-- HEAD: don't force-close after response-headers
-  
-  A HEAD response has no body length and gets the headers like the

-  properly complain on apparent bad uses and mistakes.
+  Also, the progress callback's return code was not acknowledged in this
+  state so it could make an "abort" return code to get ignored and not
+  have the documented effect of aborting an ongoing transfer.

+  tool_metalink.c: Filtered resource URLs by type
   
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-07/0104.html
+  In Metalink v3, the type attribute of url element indicates the
+  type of the resource the URL points to. It can include URL to the
+  meta data, such as BitTorrent metainfo file.  In Curl, we are not
+  interested in these meta data URLs. Instead, we are only
+  interested in the HTTP and FTP URLs. This change filters out
+  non-HTTP and FTP URLs. If we don't filter out them, it will be
+  downloaded by curl and hash check will fail if hash is provided
+  and next URL will be tried. This change will cut this useless
+  network transfer.

-- test 46: use different path lengths to get reliable sort order
+Kamil Dudka (1 Oct 2012)
+- https.c example: remember to call curl_global_init()
+  
+  ... in order not to leak memory on initializing an SSL library.
   
-  Since the order of the cookies is sorted by the length of the paths,
-  having them on the same path length will make the test depend on what
-  order the qsort() implementation will put them. As seen in the
-  windows/msys output posted by Guenter in this posting:
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-07/0105.html
+  Reported by: Tomas Mlcoch

-- [Christian Hgele brought this change]
+- FAQ: 5.16 I want a different time-out!
 
-  https_getsock: provided for schannel backend as well
+- Curl_reconnect_request: clear pointer on failure
   
-  The function https_getsock was only implemented properly when USE_SSLEAY
-  or USE_GNUTLS is defined, but it is also necessary for USE_SCHANNEL.
+  The Curl_reconnect_request() function could end up returning a pointer
+  to a free()d struct when Curl_done() failed inside. Clearing the pointer
+  unconditionally after Curl_done() avoids this risk.
   
-  The problem occurs when Curl_read_plain or Curl_write_plain returns
-  CURLE_AGAIN. In that case CURL_OK is returned to the multi-interface an
-  the used socket is set to state CURL_POLL_REMOVE and the easy-state is
-  set to CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT. This is fine, because later the socket
-  should be set to CURL_POLL_IN or CURL_POLL_OUT via multi_getsock. That's
-  where https_getsock is called and doesn't return any sockets.

-- winbuild: Make USE_WINSSL depend on USE_SSPI
-  
-  Since WinSSL cannot be build without SSPI being enabled,
-  USE_WINSSL now defaults to the value of USE_SSPI.
-  
-  The makefile does now raise an error if WinSSL is enabled
-  while SSPI is disabled.

-- winbuild: Aligned USE_SSPI with other USE_x defines
-  
-  Renamed external parameter USE_SSPI = yes/no to ENABLE_SSPI = yes/no.
-  Backwards compatible change: USE_SSPI can still be passed as external
-  parameter with yes/no value as long as ENABLE_SSPI is not given.
+  setup.h: fixed for MS VC10 build
   
-  USE_x defines are passed around with true/false values internally,
-  USE_SSPI is now aligned to this approach, but still accepts external
-  values yes/no being passed, just like the other defines.

-  - Changed space usage to line up with the whole file
-  - Renamed CFLAGS_SSPI/IPV6 to SSPI/IPV6_CFLAGS to be
-    consistent with the other CFLAGS_x variables
-  - Make use of existing CFLAGS_IPV6 (previously IPV6_CFLAGS)
-    instead of appending directly to CFLAGS
-
-Daniel Stenberg (7 Jul 2012)
-- [Nick Zitzmann brought this change]
+  Leave two bug fixes as possibly fixed for 7.28 but as nobody seems to be
+  working on them I have little hope...
 
-  darwinssl: output cipher with text, remove SNI warning
-  
-  The code was printing a warning when SNI was set up successfully. Oops.
-  
-  Printing the cipher number in verbose mode was something only TLS/SSL
-  programmers might understand, so I had it print the name of the cipher,
-  just like in the OpenSSL code. That'll be at least a little bit easier
-  to understand. The SecureTransport API doesn't have a method of getting
-  a string from a cipher like OpenSSL does, so I had to generate the
-  strings manually.

 name once again was misleading, a second name change was made and on March 20,
 1998 curl 4 was released. (The version numbering from the previous names was
 kept.)

When max_fd returns with -1, you need to wait a while and then proceed and call <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_perform</span> anyway. How long to wait?

 <p class="level0">When the application has detected action on a socket handled by libcurl, it should call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action(3)</a> with the <span Class="bold">sockfd</span> argument set to the socket with the action. When the events on a socket are known, they can be passed as an events bitmask <span Class="bold">ev_bitmask</span> by first setting <span Class="bold">ev_bitmask</span> to 0, and then adding using bitwise OR (|) any combination of events to be chosen from CURL_CSELECT_IN, CURL_CSELECT_OUT or CURL_CSELECT_ERR. When the events on a socket are unknown, pass 0 instead, and libcurl will test the descriptor internally. It is also permissible to pass CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT to the <span Class="bold">sockfd</span> parameter in order to initiate the whole process or when a timeout occurs. 
 <p class="level0">At return, the integer <span Class="bold">running_handles</span> points to will contain the number of running easy handles within the multi handle. When this number reaches zero, all transfers are complete/done. When you call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action(3)</a> on a specific socket and the counter decreases by one, it DOES NOT necessarily mean that this exact socket/transfer is the one that completed.

 <p class="level0">At return, the integer <span Class="bold">running_handles</span> points to will contain the number of still running easy handles within the multi handle. When this number reaches zero, all transfers are complete/done. Note that when you call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action(3)</a> on a specific socket and the counter decreases by one, it DOES NOT necessarily mean that this exact socket/transfer is the one that completed. Use <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_info_read.html">curl_multi_info_read(3)</a> to figure out which easy handle that completed. 
 <p class="level0">The <a class="bold" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action(3)</a> functions inform the application about updates in the socket (file descriptor) status by doing none, one, or multiple calls to the socket callback function set with the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION option to <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_setopt.html">curl_multi_setopt(3)</a>.

You can also use the <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_timeout.html">curl_multi_timeout(3)</a> function to poll the value at any given time, but for an event-based system using the callback is far better than relying on polling the timeout value.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 This function polls on all file descriptors used by the curl easy handles
 contained in the given multi handle set.  It will block until activity is
 detected on at least one of the handles or \fItimeout_ms\fP has passed.
+Alternatively, if the multi handle has a pending internal timeout that has a
+shorter expiry time than \fItimeout_ms\fP, that shorter time will be used
+instead to make sure timeout accuracy is reasonably kept.
 
 The calling application may pass additional curl_waitfd structures which are
 similar to \fIpoll(2)\fP's pollfd structure to be waited on in the same call.
 
 On completion, if \fInumfds\fP is supplied, it will be populated with the
-number of file descriptors on which interesting events occured.
+total number of file descriptors on which interesting events occured. This
+number can include both libcurl internal descriptors as well as descriptors
+provided in \fIextra_fds\fP.
 
 If no extra file descriptors are provided and libcurl has no file descriptor
 to offer to wait for, this function will return immediately.
 
 This function is encouraged to be used instead of select(3) when using the
 multi interface to allow applications to easier circumvent the common problem

 <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTPGET, 1L);

 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">For historical and traditional reasons, libcurl has a built-in progress meter that can be switched on and then makes it present a progress meter in your terminal. 
 <p class="level0">Switch on the progress meter by, oddly enough, setting CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS to zero. This option is set to 1 by default. 
 <p class="level0">For most applications however, the built-in progress meter is useless and what instead is interesting is the ability to specify a progress callback. The function pointer you pass to libcurl will then be called on irregular intervals with information about the current transfer. 
 <p class="level0">Set the progress callback by using CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION. And pass a pointer to a function that matches this prototype:

 <p class="level1">Not all protocols are HTTP-like, and thus the above may not help you when you want to make, for example, your FTP transfers to behave differently. 
 <p class="level1">Sending custom commands to a FTP server means that you need to send the commands exactly as the FTP server expects them (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt">RFC 959</a> is a good guide here), and you can only use commands that work on the control-connection alone. All kinds of commands that require data interchange and thus need a data-connection must be left to libcurl's own judgement. Also be aware that libcurl will do its very best to change directory to the target directory before doing any transfer, so if you change directory (with CWD or similar) you might confuse libcurl and then it might not attempt to transfer the file in the correct remote directory.

Note that if you use CURLOPT_QUOTE to send commands before a transfer, no transfer will actually take place when a quote command has failed. 
 <p class="level1">If you set the CURLOPT_HEADER to 1, you will tell libcurl to get information about the target file and output "headers" about it. The headers will be in "HTTP-style", looking like they do in HTTP.

IPv6 also has special address blocks like link-local and site-local that generally shouldn't be accessed by a server-side libcurl-using application.  A poorly-configured firewall installed in a data center, organization or server may also be configured to limit IPv4 connections but leave IPv6 connections wide open.

 Special-commands for the server.
 For FTP/SMTP/POP/IMAP, these are supported:
 
 REPLY [command] [return value] [response string]
  - Changes how the server responds to the [command]. [response string] is
    evaluated as a perl string, so it can contain embedded \r\n, for example.
+   There's a special [command] named "welcome" (without quotes) which is the
+   string sent immediately on connect as a welcome.
 COUNT [command] [num]
  - Do the REPLY change for [command] only [num] times and then go back to the
    built-in approach
 DELAY [command] [secs]
  - Delay responding to this command for the given time
