+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  CMake: Build fix.
+  
+  Do not match the trailing '\n' in the regular expression as this would
+  make us dump a ) parenthesis on a new line.
+  
+  This fixes the following error:
+  
+  would get transformed into:
+  
+  )
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-10/0065.html
+  Reported by: Dimitre Dimitrov
+
+- header_callback: strip off file path separated with backslashes
+  
+  If the filename contains a backslash, only use filename portion. The
+  idea is that even systems that don't handle backslashes as path
+  separators probably want that path removed for convenience.
+  
+  This flaw is considered a security problem, see the curl security
+  vulnerability http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20101013.html
+
+Dan Fandrich (12 Oct 2010)
+- Get the curl source files for Amiga from Makefile.inc
+  
+  This is similar to how it's done in the lib directory.
+  The Amiga build appears to have been broken for a year because
+  of a missing homedir.c
+
+- Added section on server-supplied names to security considerations
+
+Guenter Knauf (12 Oct 2010)
+- Fixed Watcom makefile.
+
+- Added build bits for librtmp / libssh2 to Watcom makefiles.
+
+- Added build bits for librtmp to NetWare makefiles.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (12 Oct 2010)
+- SFTP: more ignoring negative file sizes
+  
+  As the change in 5f0ae7a0626cbe709 added a precaution against negative
+  file sizes that for some reason managed to get returned, this change now
+  introduces the same check at the second place in the code where the file
+  size from the libssh2 stat call is used.
+  
+  This check might not be suitable for a 32 bit curl_off_t, but libssh2.h
+  assumes long long to work and to be 64 bit so I believe such a small
+  curl_off_t will be very unlikely to occur in the wild.
+
+- SMTP: debug output for no known auth mechanisms supported
+  
+  ... and some minor source code whitespace edits
+
+- test: urlglob error messages have no extra newline anymore
+
+Guenter Knauf (11 Oct 2010)
+- Added build bits for librtmp to MingW32 makefiles.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (8 Oct 2010)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 61f4cdb73ae4
+
+- globbing: fix crash on unballanced open brace
+  
+  Having an open brace without a closing brace caused a segfault.
+  
+  Having a closing brace too many caused a silent error to occur, which
+  caused curl to bail out and return an error code but no error message
+  was shown. It does now!
+  
+  All error message outputs no longer wrongly get _two_ newlines written
+  after the error message.
+  
+  Reported by: Vlad Ureche
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3083942

+- [Dan Locks brought this change]
+
+  libcurl.m4: AC_PATH_PROG fixes
+  
+  The invocation of autoconf's AC_PATH_PROG( ) is not quite right for
+  finding curl-config. This fix corrects the negative case (where
+  curl-config is not found).
+
+- FAQ: added "How do I submit my patch?"
+
+- examples: use example.com in example URLs
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: libidn problem not repeatable
+  
+  "261 - configure and libidn" is removed from the list since Julien
+  Chaffraix tried to repeat it but failed and the reporter did not return
+  to provide further details.
+  
+  Reported by: Lyndon Hill
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-07/0029.html
+
+- libcurl.m4: mention argument is PREFIX
+  
+  The macro provides a --with-libcurl option that expects a PREFIX to be
+  specified and not actually a "directory" in which libcurl will be found.
+  This now spells that out more clearly.
+  
+  Reported by: Dan Locks
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3079891
+
+Guenter Knauf (3 Oct 2010)
+- Some NetWare makefile tweaks.
+  
+  Renamed SDK_* to NDK_*; made NDK_* defines overwriteable from
+  environment; removed now obsolete YACC macro;
+  moved some curl_config.h defines to IPv6 section since they
+  are only needed when IPv6 is enabled - this makes libcurl compile
+  with older NDKs too which were not IPv6-aware.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Oct 2010)
+- TODO-RELEASE: 416 error fixed
+  
+  "3076808 Requests fail silently following a 416 error" done
+
+Julien Chaffraix (2 Oct 2010)
+- krb5-gssapi: Removed a memory leak in krb5_auth.
+  
+  We forgot to release the buffer passed to gss_init_sec_context.
+  
+  The previous logic was difficult to read as we were reusing the same
+  variable (gssbuf) for both input buffer and output buffer. Splitted the
+  logic in 2 variables to better underline who needs to be released.
+  Also made the code break at 80 lines.
+
+- krb5-gssapi: Made the function always return a value.
+  
+  kr5_auth missed a final 'return' statement. This is not an error in
+  gcc but can lead to potential bugs.
+
+- krb5-gssapi: Delete the GSS-API context.
+  
+  This fixes a memory leak related to the GSS-API code.
+  
+  Added a krb5_init and krb5_end functions. Also removed a work-around
+  the lack of proper initialization of the GSS-API context.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Oct 2010)
+- HTTP: remove special case for 416
+  
+  It was pointed out that the special case libcurl did for 416 was
+  incorrect and wrong. 416 is not really different to other errors so the
+  response body must be handled like for other errors/http responses.
+  
+  Reported by: Chris Smowton
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3076808
+
+- [Dan Fandrich brought this change]
+
+  sws: Added writedelay HTTP server command
+  
+  This delays between write operations, hopefully making it easier
+  to spot problems where libcurl doesn't flush the socket properly
+  before waiting for the next response.
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: no bug in ftp_nextconnect
+  
+  The issue named "266 - Bug in ftp_nextconnect?" was deemed to not be a
+  bug and instead resulted in clarified docs.
+
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY implies dir list
+  
+  Make it explicit that setting CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY to 1 will make libcurl
+  to list the directory.
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced up to 588402585bae
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: move new features to next release
+
+- README.ares: we know require c-ares 1.6.0
+
+- SFTP: avoid downloading negative sizes!
+  
+  It is still not clarified exactly why this happens, but libssh2
+  sometimes report a negative file size for the remote SFTP file and that
+  deeply confuses libcurl (or crashes it) so this precaution is added to
+  avoid badness.
+  
+  Reported by: Ernest Beinrohr
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3076430
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: drop curl_easy_setoptv
+  
+  I haven't read any really convincing arguments for adding it
+
+- [Dirk Manske brought this change]
+
+  multi & hiper examples: updates and cleanups
+  
+  all multi and hiper examples:
+  
+  * don't loop curl_multi_perform calls, that was <7.20.0 style, currently
+    the exported multi functions will not return CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
+  
+  all hiper examples:
+  * renamed check_run_count to check_multi_info
+  * don't  compare current running handle count with previous value, this
+    was the wrong way to check for finished requests, simply call
+    curl_multi_info_read
+  * it's also safe to call curl_multi_remove_handle inside the
+    curl_multi_info_read loop.
+  
+  ghiper.c:
+  * replaced curl_multi_socket (that function is marked as obsolete) calls
+    with curl_multi_socket_action calls (as in hiperfifo.c and
+    evhiperfifo.c)
+  
+  ghiper.c and evhiperfifo.c:
+  * be smart as hiperfifo.c, don't do uncessary curl_multi_* calls in
+    new_conn and main
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: one fixed, one postponed, one added
+  
+  As we're already in feature freeze, I pushed the feature onwards.
+
+Dan Fandrich (29 Sep 2010)
+- Renamed test1204 to test1117 to move it into the normal range
+
+Patrick Monnerat (29 Sep 2010)
+- Add gopher protocol definition to ILE/RPG binding.
+  OS400 compile script in test dir updated for chkhostname.
+
+Julien Chaffraix (28 Sep 2010)
+- krb5-gssapi: Remove several memory leaks.
+  
+  Remove a leak seen on Kerberos/MIT (gss_OID is copied internally and
+  we were leaking it). Now we just pass NULL as advised in RFC2744.
+  
+  |tmp| was never set back to buf->data.
+  
+  Cleaned up Curl_sec_end to take into account failure in Curl_sec_login
+  (where conn->mech would be NULL but not conn->app_data or
+  conn->in_buffer->data).
+
+- security.c: Remove Curl_sec_fflush_fd.
+  
+  The current implementation would make us send wrong data on a closed
+  socket. We don't buffer our data so the method can be safely removed.
+
+- security.c: We should always register the socket handler.
+  
+  Following a change in the way socket handler are registered, the custom
+  recv and send method were conditionaly registered.
+  We need to register them everytime to handle the ftp security
+  extensions.
+  
+  Re-added the clear text handling in sec_recv.
+
+- security.c: Fix Curl_sec_login after rewrite.
+  
+  Curl_sec_login was returning the opposite result that the code in ftp.c
+  was expecting. Simplified the return code (using a CURLcode) so to see
+  more clearly what is going on.
+
+- security.c: Readd the '\n' to the infof() calls.
+  
+  They are not automatically added and make the output of the verbose
+  mode a lot more readable.
+
+- security.c: Fix typo (PSBZ -> PBSZ)
+
+- security.c: Fix ftp_send_command.
+  
+  My use of va_args was completely wrong. Fixed the usage so that
+  we send the right commands!
+
+Daniel Stenberg (28 Sep 2010)
+- curl_easy_escape: don't escape "unreserved" characters
+  
+  According to RFC3986 section 2.3 the letters -, ., _ and ~ should not be
+  percent-encoded.
+  
+  Reported by: Miguel Diaz
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-09/0227.html
+
+- multi: don't expire timeouts at disonnect or done
+  
+  The functions Curl_disconnect() and Curl_done() are both used within the
+  scope of a single request so they cannot be allowed to use
+  Curl_expire(... 0) to kill all timeouts as there are some timeouts that
+  are set before a request that are supposed to remain until the request
+  is done.
+  
+  The timeouts are now instead cleared at curl_easy_cleanup() and when the
+  multi state machine changes a handle to the complete state.
+
+Dan Fandrich (27 Sep 2010)
+- Changed the TPF make file to get source files from Makefile.inc
+  
+  Patch was fixed and validated by David McCreedy.
+
+- Added test case 1204 to test HTTP range failure
+  
+  This is an attempt to reproduce bug #3076808
+
+Daniel Stenberg (27 Sep 2010)
+- [Dirk Manske brought this change]
+
+  multi_runsingle: set timeout error messages
+  
+  With the latest changes to fix the timeout handling with multi interface
+  we lost the timeout error messages. This patch brings them back.
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: updated list of issues to work on
+
+- parsedate: allow time specified without seconds
+  
+  The date format in RFC822 allows that the seconds part of HH:MM:SS is
+  left out, but this function didn't allow it. This change also includes a
+  modified test case that makes sure that this now works.
+  
+  Reported by: Matt Ford
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3076529
+
+- TFTP: re-indented the source code
+  
+  Just made sure that the good old curl indentation style is used all over
+  this file.
+
+- [Tim Newsome brought this change]
+
+  TFTP: Work around tftpd-hpa upload bug
+  
+  tftpd-hpa has a bug where it will send an incorrect ack when the block
+  counter wraps and tftp options have been sent. Work around that by
+  accepting an ack for 65535 when we're expecting one for 0.
+
+- Revert "security.c: buffer_read various fixes."
+  
+  This reverts commit fbb38de415b7bb7d743e53a7b4b887ffb12b3e5b.
+
+- security.c: removed superfluous parentheses
+  
+  And also removed the FIXME where memory was zeroed just before freed,
+  and some other minor whitespace changes.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: Update the #include statements after the rewrite.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: sec_write tweaks
+  
+  - |fd| is now a curl_socket_t and |len| a size_t to avoid conversions.
+  - Added 2 FIXMEs about the 2 unsigned -> signed conversions.
+  - Included 2 minor changes to Curl_sec_end.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: _sec_send tweaks
+  
+  - Renamed the method to sec_send now that we
+    renamed sec_send to do_sec_send.
+  - Some more variable renaming.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: sec_read tweaks
+  
+  - Renamed the function to sec_recv.
+  - Renamed the parameters and variable to match the rest of the code.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: Curl_sec_fflush_fd tweaks
+  
+  - Use an early return as it makes the code more readable.
+  - Added a FIXME about a conversion.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: sec_send tweaks
+  
+  - Renamed it to do_sec_send as it is the function doing the actual
+    transfer.
+  - Do not return any values as no one was checking it and it never
+    reported a failure (added a FIXME about checking for errors).
+  - Renamed the variables to make their use more specific.
+  - Removed some casts (int -> curl_socket_t, ...)
+  - Avoid doing the htnl <-> nthl twice by caching the 2 results.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: Curl_sec_read_msg tweaks
+  
+  - Renamed the variables name to better match their intend.
+  - Unified the |decoded_len| checks.
+  - Added some FIXMEs to flag some improvement that did not go in this
+    change.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: Curl_sec_set_protection_level tweaking
+  
+  - Removed sec_prot_internal as it is now inlined in the function (this removed
+    a redundant check).
+  - Changed the prototype to return an error code.
+  - Updated the method to use the new ftp_send_command function.
+  - Added a level_to_char helper method to avoid relying on the compiler's
+    bound checks. This default to the maximum security we have in case of a
+    wrong input.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: factored the logic from Curl_sec_login into a dedicated method that better reflect its intent.
+  
+  Introduced a helper method ftp_send_command that synchronously send
+  an FTP query.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: Remove out_buffer as it was never written into.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: buffer_read various fixes.
+  
+  Tighten the type of the |data| parameter to avoid a cast. Also made
+  it const as we should not modify it.
+  
+  Added a DEBUGASSERT on the size to be written while changing it.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: Made block_write return a CURLcode.
+  
+  While doing so, renamed it to socket_write to better match its
+  function.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  security.c: Made block_read and sec_get_data return CURLcode.
+  
+  To do so, made block_read call Curl_read_plain instead of read.
+  
+  While changing them renamed block_read to socket_read and sec_get_data
+  to read_data to better match their function.
+  
+  Also fixed a potential memory leak in block_read.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  Security.c: Fix headers guard to match the rest of the code.
+
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  configure: Fix the LDAPS disable message
+  
+  ... for example when LDAP is not compiled.
+  
+  Fixed the logic to match the rest of the options' message that is we
+  update the default message only if the option is not disabled after the
+  different checks.
+

+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: sync with 8665d4e5 and c-ares >= 1.6.0 note
+
+- parse_remote_port: ignore colons without port number
+  
+  Obviously, browsers ignore a colon without a following port number. Both
+  Firefox and Chrome just removes the colon for such URLs. This change
+  does not remove the colon for URLs sent over a HTTP proxy, so we should
+  consider doing that change as well.
+  
+  Reported by: github user 'kreshano'
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: in sync with 19f45eaa799
+
+- duphandle: use ares_dup()
+  
+  curl_easy_duphandle() was not properly duping the ares channel. The
+  ares_dup() function was introduced in c-ares 1.6.0 so by starting to use
+  this function we also raise the bar and require c-ares >= 1.6.0
+  (released Dec 9, 2008) for such builds.

+- [Hendrik Visage brought this change]
+
+  MacOSX-Framework: updates for Snowleopard
+  
+  1) PPC64 appears to be an 10.5 only supported architecture, so I
+  forced 10.5 for 64bit if there is a need for PPC64, else 64bit only
+  does x86_64
+  
+  2) proper "make clean" after every ./configure. fixes a bug where
+  subsequent runs the 32bit do not get compiled
+  
+  3) Added a version numbering curl-$VERSION} rather than the "stock standard" A
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 5fcc4332d62fe
+  
+  Removed the duplicate entry of Kamil in the credits.
+
+- configure: don't enable RTMP if the lib detect fails
+  
+  librtmp is often statically linked and using sub dependencies like
+  OpenSSL, so we need to make sure we can actually link with it properly
+  before enabling it. Otherwise we easily end up trying to link with a
+  RTMP lib that fails.
+
+- TODO: added 8.4 non-gcrypt under GnuTLS
+  
+  We must not assume gcrypt just because of GnuTLS
+
+- configure: check for gcrypt if using GnuTLS
+  
+  1 - libcurl assumes that there are gcrypt functions available when
+  GnuTLS is.
+  
+  2 - GnuTLS can be built to use libnettle instead as crypto library,
+  which breaks assumption (1)
+  
+  This change makes configure make sure that if GnuTLS is requested and
+  detected, it also makes sure that gcrypt is present or it errors
+  out. This is mostly a way to make the user more aware of this flaw, the
+  correct fix would be to detect which crypto layer that is in use and
+  adapt our code to use that instead of blindly assuming gcrypt.

+- FTP: fix bad check of Curl_timeleft() return code
+  
+  When it returns 0 it means no timeout. Only a negative value means that
+  we're out of time.
+
+- LDAP: moved variable declaration to avoid compiler warn
+  
+  If built without HTTP or proxy support it would cause a compiler warning
+  due to the unused variable. I moved the declaration of it into the only
+  scope it is used.
+
+Tor Arntsen (18 Sep 2010)
+- LDAP: Use FALSE instead of bool_false when setting bits.close
+  
+  bool_false is the internal name used in the setup_once.h definition
+  we fall back to for non-C99 non-stdbool systems, it's not the actual

+- LDAP: Add missing declaration for 'result'
+
+Daniel Stenberg (18 Sep 2010)
+- [Mauro Iorio brought this change]
+
+  LDAP: Support for tunnelling queries through HTTP proxy
+  
+  As of curl-7.21.1 tunnelling ldap queries through HTTP Proxies is not
+  supported. Actually if --proxytunnel command-line option (or equivalent
+  CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL) is used for ldap queries like
+  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/... You are unable to successfully execute the
+  query. In facts ldap_*_bind is executed directly against the ldap server
+  and proxy is totally ignored. This is true for both openLDAP and
+  Microsoft LDAP API.
+  
+  Step to reproduce the error:
+  Just launch "curl --proxytunnel --proxy 192.168.1.1:8080
+  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/dc=... "
+  
+  This fix adds an invocation to Curl_proxyCONNECT against the provided
+  proxy address and on successful "CONNECT" it tunnels ldap query to the
+  final ldap server through the HTTP proxy. As far as I know Microsoft
+  LDAP APIs don't permit tunnelling in any way so the patch provided is
+  for OpenLDAP only.  The patch has been developed against OpenLDAP 2.4.23
+  and has been tested with Microsoft ISA Server 2006 and works properly
+  with basic, digest and NTLM authentication.

+- timeout: use the correct start value as offset
+  
+  Rodric provide an awesome recipe that proved libcurl didn't timeout at
+  the requested time - it instead often timed out at [connect time] +
+  [timeout time] instead of the documented and intended [timeout time]
+  only. This bug was due to the code using the wrong base offset when
+  comparing against "now". I could also take the oppurtinity to simplify
+  the code by properly using of the generic help function for this:
+  Curl_timeleft.
+  
+  Reported by: Rodric Glaser
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3061535
+
+- Curl_timeleft: avoid returning "no timeout" by mistake
+  
+  As this function uses return code 0 to mean that there is no timeout, it
+  needs to check that it doesn't return a time left value that is exactly
+  zero. It could lead to libcurl doing an extra 1000 ms select() call and
+  thus not timing out as accurately as it should.
+  
+  I fell over this bug when working on the bug 3061535 but this fix does
+  not correct that problem alone, although this is a problem that needs to
+  be fixed.

+- multi: fixes for timing out handles
+  
+  Add a timeout check for handles in the state machine so that they will
+  timeout in all states disregarding what actions that may or may not

+  
+  Fixed a bug in socket_action introduced recently when looping over timed
+  out handles: it wouldn't assign the 'data' variable and thus it wouldn't
+  properly take care of handles.
+  
+  In the update_timer function, the code now checks if the timeout has
+  been removed and then it tells the application. Previously it would
+  always let the remaining timeout(s) just linger to expire later on.
+
+- threaded resolver: no more expire 0 calls
+  
+  Curl_expire() set to 0 expires ALL timeouts so it should only be called

+  Make use of the helper function Curl_timeleft() instead of duplicating
+  code.
+
+- multi: make sure the next timeout is used when one expires
+  
+  Each easy handle has a list of timeouts, so as soon as the main timeout
+  for a handle expires, we must make sure to get the next entry from the
+  list and re-add the handle to the splay tree.
+  
+  This was attempted previously but was done poorly in my commit

+- cmdline: make -F type= accept ;charset=

+  The -F option allows some custom parameters within the given string, and

+  ... as the second one would be seen as a separator and "charset" is no
+  parameter curl knows anything about so it was just silently discarded.
+  
+  The new logic now checks if the semicolon and following keyword looks
+  like a parameter it knows about and if it isn't it is assumed to be

+  The script works exactly same as the Perl one except for one thing:

+  as what the Perl scripr does (redirect stdout into file) but this

+- multi: two fixes done
+
+- multi: use timeouts properly for MAX_RECV/SEND_SPEED
+  
+  When detecting that the send or recv speed, the multi interface changes
+  state to TOOFAST and previously there was no timeout set that would
+  force a recheck but it would rely on the application to somehow call
+  libcurl anyway. This now sets a timeout for a suitable future time to
+  check again if the average transfer speed is then below the threshold
+  again.
+
+- multi: support timeouts
+  
+  Curl_expire() is now expanded to hold a list of timeouts for each easy
+  handle. Only the closest in time will be the one used as the primary
+  timeout for the handle and will be used for the splay tree (which sorts
+  and lists all handles within the multi handle).
+  
+  When the main timeout has triggered/expired, the next timeout in time
+  that is kept in the list will be moved to the main timeout position and
+  used as the key to splay with. This way, all timeouts that are set with
+  Curl_expire() internally will end up as a proper timeout. Previously any
+  Curl_expire() that set a _later_ timeout than what was already set was
+  just silently ignored and thus missed.
+  
+  Setting Curl_expire() with timeout 0 (zero) will cancel all previously
+  added timeouts.
+  
+  Corrects known bug #62.
+
+- Curl_llist_insert_next: allow insertion first in the list
+  
+  When we specify the "insert after" entry as NULL, this function now
+  inserts the new entry first in the list.
+
+- multi: make curl_multi_info_read perform O(1)
+  
+  Instead of looping over all attached easy handles, this now keeps a list
+  of messages in the multi handle. It allows curl_multi_info_read() to
+  perform O(1) no matter how many easy handles that are handled. This is
+  of importance since this function may be polled very frequently by apps
+  using the multi interface.

-  two curlbuild.h files, one in the source tree and another in the build tree.
-
-- Make configure remove the ares_build.h file included in distribution tarballs.
-
-- Fix macro redefinition.
-
-- Fix name space pollution.
-
-- Allow using different extra import libraries for debug and release builds.
-
-- Add manifest stuff to msvc makefile
-
-Daniel Stenberg (20 Nov 2009)
-- - Constantine Sapuntzakis identified a write after close, as the sockets were
-    closed by libcurl before the SSL lib were shutdown and they may write to its
-    socket. Detected to at least happen with OpenSSL builds.
-
-Yang Tse (20 Nov 2009)
-- Sync man page with reality
-
-- Add missing external API decoration for ares_set_socket_callback()
-
-Daniel Stenberg (20 Nov 2009)
-- - Jad Chamcham pointed out a bug with connection re-use. If a connection had
-    CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL enabled over a proxy, a subsequent request using the
-    same proxy with the tunnel option disabled would still wrongly re-use that
-    previous connection and the outcome would only be badness.
-
-Yang Tse (20 Nov 2009)
-- Add ares_free_data() man page.
-
-- - Provide in external interface preprocessor symbol definitions for
-    CARES_HAVE_ARES_FREE_DATA as an indication of function availability.
-
-- Remove typecast
-
-- Fix comment
-
-- Add ares_data.c and ares_data.h
-
-- Jakub Hrozek modified ares_parse_srv_reply() and ares_parse_txt_reply() API
-  to return a linked lists of results. These were also modified to internally
-  use the ares_data memory struct and as such its result must be free'ed with
-  ares_free_data().
-
-- Initial support for the generic ares_free_data() function that will allow
-  applications to free memory allocated and returned by some c-ares funtions.
-
-- Explicit initialization of all FTP struct members in ftp_init()
-
-- Fix compiler warning: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and code
-
-- Make memory tracking system intolerant with zero sized malloc(),
-  calloc() and realloc() function calls.
-
-- Make usage of calloc()'s arguments consistent with rest of code base
-
-- workaround icc 9.1 optimizer issue
-
-Daniel Stenberg (17 Nov 2009)
-- - Constantine Sapuntzakis provided another fix for the DNS cache that could
-    end up with entries that wouldn't time-out:
-  
-    1. Set up a first web server that redirects (307) to a http://server:port
-       that's down
-    2. Have curl connect to the first web server using curl multi
-  
-    After the curl_easy_cleanup call, there will be curl dns entries hanging
-    around with in_use != 0.
-  
-    (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2891591)
-
-- - Marc Kleine-Budde fixed: curl saved the LDFLAGS set during configure into
-    its pkg-config file.  So -Wl stuff ended up in the .pc file, which is really
-    bad, and breaks if there are multiple -Wl in our LDFLAGS (which are in
-    PTXdist). bug #2893592 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2893592)
-
-Yang Tse (16 Nov 2009)
-- Add icc fvisibility bug test
-
-- Fix icc 9.0 compiler warning: external definition with no prior declaration
-
-- Update serial number
-
-- Fix three var names
-
-- Add check for assert.h header file
-
-Kamil Dudka (15 Nov 2009)
-- - David Byron improved the configure script to use pkg-config to find OpenSSL
-    (and in particular the list of required libraries) even if a path is given
-    as argument to --with-ssl
-
-Yang Tse (15 Nov 2009)
-- getaddrinfo is fully thread safe on solaris versions which
-  implement the function even when h_errno is not a macro.
-  
-  The h_errno macro test now only done on systems for which there
-  is no hard coded knowledge about getaddrinfo's thread safeness.
-
-- Client certificate ENG file type requires OpenSSL 0.9.7 or newer
-
-- Remove files generated on previous buildconf/configure run
-
-- Add a couple of renamed files to the removal list
-
-- Remove enable-thread / disable-thread configure option. These were only placebo
-  options. The library is always built as thread safe as possible on every system.
-
-Claes Jakobsson (14 Nov 2009)
-- Added '--configure' option to curl-config to display original configure arguments when curl was built
-
-Yang Tse (14 Nov 2009)
-- Refactor how preprocessor symbol _THREAD_SAFE definition is done.
-
-- OpenSSL 0.9.7 or newer required for ENGINE_CTRL_GET_CMD_FROM_NAME definition
-
-Daniel Stenberg (14 Nov 2009)
-- - Claes Jakobsson restored the configure functionality to detect NSS when
-    --with-nss is set but not "yes".
-  
-    I think we can still improve that to check for pkg-config in that path etc,
-    but at least this patch brings back the same functionality we had before.
-
-- - Camille Moncelier added support for the file type SSL_FILETYPE_ENGINE for
-    the client certificate. It also disable the key name test as some engines
-    can select a private key/cert automatically (When there is only one key
-    and/or certificate on the hardware device used by the engine)
-
-Yang Tse (14 Nov 2009)
-- - Constantine Sapuntzakis provided the fix that ensures that an SSL connection
-    won't be reused unless protection level for peer and host verification match.
-
-- Assume that getaddrinfo is thread safe, unless hard coded
-  knowledge says the contrary or h_errno is not defined.
-
-- Related with the threadsafe capability of getaddrinfo:
-  
-  - Constantine Sapuntzakis reported that Darwin 6.0 a.k.a. MAC OS X 10.2
-    and newer have a threadsafe getaddrinfo.
-  
-  - Fix Dragonfly BSD triplet detection.
-  
-  - In case the hard-coded knowledge says that getaddrinfo is threadsafe,
-    an additional check is done to verify that h_errno is also defined.
-    If h_errno isn't defined, we finally assume that it isn't threadsafe.
-    Jamie Lokier provided the inspiration for this extra check.
-
-- AIX 5.2 and newer have threadsafe getaddrinfo.
-  
-  Add some comments to better understand what the regex's pretend to achieve.
-
-- HP-UX 11.11 and later have threadsafe getaddrinfo
-
-- Constantine Sapuntzakis patch for hostip.c
-  
-  No need for a separate variable ndns.
-  
-  The memory leak detection will detect code that fails to release a dns reference.
-  
-  The DEBUGASSERT will detect code that releases too many references.
-
-- Check if getaddrinfo is threadsafe when function check allows it to be used
-
-- Add missing variable initialization
-
-Kamil Dudka (12 Nov 2009)
-- - libcurl-NSS now tries to reconnect with TLS disabled in case it detects
-    a broken TLS server. However it does not happen if SSL version is selected
-    manually. The approach was originally taken from PSM. Kaspar Brand helped me
-    to complete the patch. Original bug reports:
-    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/525496
-    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/527771
-
-- - Kevin Baughman provided a fix preventing libcurl-NSS from crash on doubly
-    closed NSPR descriptor. The issue was hard to find, reported several times
-    before and always closed unresolved. More info at the RH bug:
-    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/534176
-
-Yang Tse (12 Nov 2009)
-- Make hostip.c compile again
-
-Dan Fandrich (11 Nov 2009)
-- Made the path to the binaries absolute
-
-Yang Tse (11 Nov 2009)
-- Add last change credit
-
-- - Marco Maggi reported that compilation failed when configured --with-gssapi
-    and GNU GSS installed due to a missing mutual exclusion of header files in
-    the Kerberos 5 code path. He also verified that my patch worked for him.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (11 Nov 2009)
-- NSS SSL connections are also blocking
-
-- - Constantine Sapuntzakis posted bug #2891595
-    (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2891595) which identified how an entry
-    in the DNS cache would linger too long if the request that added it was in
-    use that long. He also provided the patch that now makes libcurl capable of
-    still doing a request while the DNS hash entry may get timed out.
-
-- - Christian Schmitz noticed that the progress meter/callback was not properly
-    used during the FTP connection phase (after the actual TCP connect), while
-    it of course should be. I also made the speed check get called correctly so
-    that really slow servers will trigger that properly too.
-
-Yang Tse (11 Nov 2009)
-- Renamed fpGetNetworkParams and fpSystemFunction036 to avoid namespace pollution with static library
-
-- Add kernel32.lib
-
-- Mention last changes
-
-- Reinstate copyright symbol lost in previous commit
-
-- Make some strings different in resource file for debug or release builds
-
-- Ignore more subdirs
-
-- Fix compiler warning: conditional expression is constant
-
-- Sync linker and resource compiler options with Makefile.msvc
-
-- Follow Makefile.msvc subdirectory naming scheme, and sync compiler options
-
-- Updated MSVC makefile that allows building dynamic and static
-  c-ares libraries in debug and release flavours.
-  
-  Additionally each of the three sample programs is built against
-  each of the four possible c-ares libraries, generating all this
-  a total number of 12 executables and 4 libraries.
-
-- Test for USE_WINSOCK since it is more restrictive than WIN32
-
-- Make header inclusion depend on HAVE_*_H definition
-
-- Remove unneeded preprocessor directives
-
-Daniel Stenberg (7 Nov 2009)
-- Joshua Kwan added paragraph 4.18 about file:// URLs on windows etc
-
-Yang Tse (5 Nov 2009)
-- Adjust c-ares include paths for memory tracking enabled (--enable-curldebug) builds
-
-Kamil Dudka (5 Nov 2009)
-- - Dropped misleading timeouts in libcurl-NSS and made sure the SSL socket works
-    in non-blocking mode.
-
-Yang Tse (5 Nov 2009)
-- I removed leading 'curl' path on the 'curlbuild.h' include statement in
-  curl.h, adjusting auto-makefiles include path, to enhance portability to
-  OS's without an orthogonal directory tree structure such as OS/400.
-
-- avoid division by zero
-
-Daniel Stenberg (4 Nov 2009)
-- - I fixed several problems with the transfer progress meter. It showed the
-    wrong percentage for small files, most notable for <1000 bytes and could
-    easily end up showing more than 100% at the end. It also didn't show any
-    percentage, transfer size or estimated transfer times when transferring
-    less than 100 bytes.
-
-Yang Tse (4 Nov 2009)
-- source files used by sample programs
-
-Daniel Stenberg (4 Nov 2009)
-- start over towards 7.19.8
-
-- updated with names from the 7.19.7 release notes
-
-Version 7.19.7 (4 Nov 2009)
-
-Daniel Stenberg (4 Nov 2009)
-- fix the find command line
-
-- avoid fiddling in the ares subdir since that isn't part of the release
-  tarball
-
-- release coming up
-
-- syntax
-
-- I have next to no hope of fixing more bugs before 7.19.7 so all are now
-  moved to 7.19.8. I removed the bugs already in KNOWN_BUGS (but they should
-  of course still get fixed).
-  
-  Added three recent bugs. 7.19.8 is targetted to get shipped in Janurary 2010
-
-Dan Fandrich (4 Nov 2009)
-- Put the Symbian binaries into the more modern locations in ROM
-
-- Updated systems, bindings, NTLM support

-Yang Tse (2 Nov 2009)
-- include progress.h for Curl_pgrsSetDownloadCounter function prototype
-
-Daniel Stenberg (2 Nov 2009)
-- - As reported independent by both Stan van de Burgt and Didier Brisebourg,
-    CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD (the -w variable size_download) didn't work when
-    getting data from ldap!
-
-- describe the cmake situation
-
-Yang Tse (2 Nov 2009)
-- Renamed c-ares setup.h to ares_setup.h
-
-- Adjust include paths to take in account that currently:
-  
-  c-ares with --enable-curldebug uses memdebug.h from libcurl's lib subdirectory.
-  
-  memdebug.h needs access to libcurl's setup.h from libcurl's lib subdirectory
-  and also needs access to libcurl's generated curl_config.h
-
-- Undo old temporary change once used for testing purposes
-
-Daniel Stenberg (31 Oct 2009)
-- - Gabriel Kuri reported a problem with CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD if the
-    download was 0 bytes, as libcurl would then return the size as unknown (-1)
-    and not 0. I wrote a fix and test case 566 to verify it.
-
-Yang Tse (31 Oct 2009)
-- Mention many changes
-
-- Mention --enable-symbol-hiding configure option
-
-- Symbol hiding configure options renamed to the hopefully less ambiguous
-  --enable-symbol-hiding and --disable-symbol-hiding as well as related
-  macro names and some internal variables used for them.
-  
-  Related configuration file preprocessor symbols named to
-  CARES_SYMBOL_HIDING and CARES_SYMBOL_SCOPE_EXTERN.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (30 Oct 2009)
-- Added test case 566 in an attempt to repeat bug 2884561
-  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2884561) but it seems to work for me...
-
-- - Liza Alenchery mentioned a problem with re-used SCP connection when a bad
-    auth is used, as it caused a crash. I failed to repeat the issue, but still
-    made a change that now forces the TCP connection used for a freed SCP
-    session to get closed and not be re-used.
-
-- - "Tom" posted a bug report that mentioned how libcurl did wrong when doing a
-    POST using a read callback, with Digest authentication and
-    "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" enforced.  I would then cause the first request
-    to be wrongly sent and then basically hang until the server closed the
-    connection. I fixed the problem and added test case 565 to verify it.
-
-Yang Tse (30 Oct 2009)
-- Header inclusion depending on HAVE_* symbol.
-  Fix two typos.
-
-- Comparison of the Initial revision of this file with ares_parse_a_reply.c
-  shows that this one is actually a modified copy of ares_parse_a_reply.c.
-  
-  In order to comply with ares_parse_a_reply.c's M.I.T. license, the old
-  1998 M.I.T. copyright notice is now also preserved in this file the same
-  as it is done in other ares_parse_*.c files.
-
-- Add CVS Id tag.
-  Fix identation of some license lines.
-
-- Add CVS Id tag.
-
-- Fix comment
-
-- In no particular order, changed/fixed all of the following in
-  ares_parse_txt_reply() current version:
-  
-  - Fixed a couple of potential double free's.
-  
-  - Fixed memory leaks upon out of memory condition.
-  
-  - Fixed pointer arithmetic.
-  
-  - Setting ntxtreply to zero upon entry for all failure cases.
-  
-  - Changed data type to size_t for variables substr_len, str_len and
-    the length member of ares_txt_reply struct.
-  
-  - Avoided a couple of memcpy() calls.
-  
-  - Changed i data type to unsigned int to prevent compiler warnings.
-  
-  - Adjusted a comment.
-  
-  - Use ARES_SUCCESS literal for successfull completion.
-  
-  - Added CVS Id tag.
-
-- Add c-ares DLL resource file to distribution archive
-
-- ignore files
-
-- Empty subdir
-
-- Updated MSVC 6.0 workspace and project files that allows building
-  dynamic and static c-ares libraries in debug and release flavours.
-  
-  Additionally each of the three sample programs is built against
-  each of the four possible c-ares libraries, generating all this
-  a total number of 12 executables and 4 libraries.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (29 Oct 2009)

-  MUST be valid and they are dereferenced further down in the function
-  unconditionally!
-
-- shorten the descriptions somewhat
-
-- update to the new struct name
-
-- Jakub Hrozek added ares_parse_txt_reply() for TXT parsing
-
-- use 'ares_srv_reply' for proper name-spacing
-
-Yang Tse (29 Oct 2009)
-- Fix compiler warning: control reaches end of non-void function
-
-- Take in account c-ares 1.6.1 will use __declspec function decoration
-  for Win32 and Symbian unless CARES_STATICLIB is defined to use static
-  library linkage.
-
-- Add reference for ares_parse_srv_reply.pdf
-
-- Add reference for ares_parse_srv_reply docs
-
-- External API function linkage decoration adjustment
-
-- External API function linkage decoration adjustment
-
-Daniel Stenberg (28 Oct 2009)
-- Since the NSS lib closes the socket the memory tracking system wrongly gets a
-  false positive on a leaked socket, so this introduces a way to tell the system
-  that the socket is indeed closed without explicitly closing it!
-
-Yang Tse (28 Oct 2009)
-- Initial step towards the ability to reduce c-ares exported symbols
-  based on the 'visibility' attribute for GNUC and __global for Sun
-  compilers, taking also in account __declspec function decoration
-  for Win32 and Symbian DLL's.
-  
-  Introducing configure options --enable-hidden-symbols and
-  --disable-hidden-symbols following libcurl's naming.
-
-- libssh2 detection changes mentioned in http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2009-10/0343.html

-- Fix Pelles C Win32 target compilation issues
-
-Daniel Stenberg (26 Oct 2009)
-- grrr, removed the conflict markers
-
-- spell fix by Michael Wood
-
-- - Dima Barsky made the curl cookie parser accept cookies even with blank or
-    unparsable expiry dates and then treat them as session cookies - previously
-    libcurl would reject cookies with a date format it couldn't parse. Research
-    shows that the major browser treat such cookies as session cookies. I
-    modified test 8 and 31 to verify this.
-

-
-- spelling corrections

-Yang Tse (21 Oct 2009)
-- Detect when msvc 6.0 is in use without PSDK installed, intentionally
-  fail to build when this happens, and show an appropriate error.
-  
-  The brave of heart can circumvect this. Defining ALLOW_MSVC6_WITHOUT_PSDK
-  in lib/config-win32.h, although absolutely discouraged and unsupported,
-  this will allow the die hard MSVC hacker to build in such a discouraged
-  environment.

-- Fix compiler warning: local variable may be used without having been initialized
-
-- Use *_CHECK_PATH_SEPARATOR_REQUIRED to ensure that *_CHECK_PATH_SEPARATOR
-  is only expanded and included once in the configure script.
-
-- Our _AS_PATH_SEPARATOR_PREPARE override is now m4_defun'd instead of m4_define'd

-
-Daniel Stenberg (18 Oct 2009)
-- - Ray Dassen provided a patch in Debian's bug tracker (bug number #551461)
-    that now makes curl_getdate(3) actually handles RFC 822 formatted dates that

 63. When CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY is used, the handle cannot reliably be re-used
   for any further requests or transfers. The work-around is then to close that
   handle with curl_easy_cleanup() and create a new. Some more details:

-62. CURLOPT_TIMEOUT does not work properly with the regular multi and

 61. If an upload using Expect: 100-continue receives an HTTP 417 response,
   it ought to be automatically resent without the Expect:.  A workaround is
   for the client application to redo the transfer after disabling Expect:.

 User-supplied data must be sanitized when used in options like
 CURLOPT_USERAGENT, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS and others that
 are used to generate structured data. Characters like embedded carriage
 returns or ampersands could allow the user to create additional headers or
 fields that could cause malicious transactions.
 
+.IP "Server-supplied Names"
+A server can supply data which the application may, in some cases, use as
+a file name. The curl command-line tool does this with --remote-header-name,
+using the Content-disposition: header to generate a file name.  An application
+could also use CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL to generate a file name from a
+server-supplied redirect URL. Special care must be taken to sanitize such
+names to avoid the possibility of a malicious server supplying one like
+"/etc/passwd", "\autoexec.bat" or even ".bashrc".
+
 .IP "Server Certificates"
 A secure application should never use the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option to
 disable certificate validation. There are numerous attacks that are enabled
 by apps that fail to properly validate server TLS/SSL certificates,
 thus enabling a malicious server to spoof a legitimate one. HTTPS without
 validated certificates is potentially as insecure as a plain HTTP connection.

 6. HTTP Authentication
 
  HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and
  password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're
  doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by
  default) is *plain* *text* based, which means it sends username and password
  only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on
  the network between you and the remote server.
 
  To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication:
 
-        curl -u name:password www.secrets.com
+        curl --user name:password http://www.secrets.com
 
  The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers
  returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even
  --anyauth might be options that suit you.
 
  Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP
  proxy. This seems to be especially common at various companies. A HTTP proxy
  may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to
  the Internet. To specify those with curl, run something like:
 
-        curl -U proxyuser:proxypassword curl.haxx.se
+        curl --proxy-user proxyuser:proxypassword curl.haxx.se
 
  If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,
  use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest.
 
  If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password
  part, curl will prompt for the password interactively.

 2.4 Fix HTTP Pipelining for PUT
 
  HTTP Pipelining can be a way to greatly enhance performance for multiple
  serial requests and currently libcurl only supports that for HEAD and GET
  requests but it should also be possible for PUT.

- When checking if there's info to return, this function scans over ALL added
- easy handles every time. That makes this function unnecessary heavy and slow.

 8.3 check connection
 
  Add a way to check if the connection seems to be alive, to correspond to the
  SSL_peak() way we use with OpenSSL.
 
+8.4 non-gcrypt
+
+ libcurl assumes that there are gcrypt functions available when
+ GnuTLS is.
+
+ GnuTLS can be built to use libnettle instead as crypto library,
+ which breaks the previously mentioned assumption
+
+ The correct fix would be to detect which crypto layer that is in use and

 ## Makefile for building libcurl.a with MingW32 (GCC-3.2 or later)
 ## and optionally OpenSSL (0.9.8), libssh2 (1.2), zlib (1.2.5)
 ##
 ## Usage:
-## mingw32-make -f Makefile.m32 [SSL=1] [SSH2=1] [ZLIB=1] [IDN=1] [SSPI=1] [IPV6=1] [LDAPS=1] [DYN=1]

 ##
 ## Hint: you can also set environment vars to control the build, f.e.:
 ## set ZLIB_PATH=c:/zlib-1.2.5
 ## set ZLIB=1

 ## Makefile for building curl.exe with MingW32 (GCC-3.2 or later)
 ## and optionally OpenSSL (0.9.8), libssh2 (1.2), zlib (1.2.5)
 ##
 ## Usage:
-## mingw32-make -f Makefile.m32 [SSL=1] [SSH2=1] [ZLIB=1] [IDN=1] [SSPI=1] [IPV6=1] [LDAPS=1] [DYN=1]

 ##
 ## Hint: you can also set environment vars to control the build, f.e.:
 ## set ZLIB_PATH=c:/zlib-1.2.5
 ## set ZLIB=1
