                                   Changelog
 
+Version 7.19.3 (19 January 2009)
+
+Daniel Stenberg (16 Jan 2009)
+- Andrew de los Reyes fixed curlbuild.h for "generic" gcc builds on PPC, both
+  32 bit and 64 bit.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (15 Jan 2009)
+- Tim Ansell fixed a compiler warning in lib/cookie.c
+
+Daniel Stenberg (14 Jan 2009)
+- Grant Erickson fixed timeouts for TFTP such that specifying a
+  connect-timeout, a max-time or both options work correctly and as expected
+  by passing the correct boolean value to Curl_timeleft via the
+  'duringconnect' parameter.
+
+  With this small change, curl TFTP now behaves as expected (and likely as
+  originally-designed):
+
+  1) For non-existent or unreachable dotted IP addresses:
+
+   a) With no options, follows the default curl 300s timeout...
+   b) With --connect-timeout only, follows that value...
+   c) With --max-time only, follows that value...
+   d) With both --connect-timeout and --max-time, follows the smaller value...
+
+   and times out with a "curl: (7) Couldn't connect to server" error.
+
+  2) For transfers to/from a valid host:
+
+   a) With no options, follows default curl 300s timeout for the
+      first XRQ/DATA/ACK transaction and the default TFTP 3600s
+      timeout for the remainder of the transfer...
+
+   b) With --connect-time only, follows that value for the
+      first XRQ/DATA/ACK transaction and the default TFTP 3600s
+      timeout for the remainder of the transfer...
+
+   c) With --max-time only, follows that value for the first
+      XRQ/DATA/ACK transaction and for the remainder of the
+      transfer...
+
+   d) With both --connect-timeout and --max-time, follows the former
+      for the first XRQ/DATA/ACK transaction and the latter for the
+      remainder of the transfer...
+
+   and times out with a "curl: (28) Timeout was reached" error as
+   appropriate.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (13 Jan 2009)
+- Michael Wallner fixed a NULL pointer deref when calling
+  curl_easy_setup(curl, CURLOPT_COOKIELIST, "SESS") on a CURL handle with no
+  cookies data.
+
+- Stefan Teleman brought a patch to fix the default curlbuild.h file for the
+  SunPro compilers.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (12 Jan 2009)
+- Based on bug report #2498665 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2498665)
+  by Daniel Black, I've now added magic to the configure script that makes it
+  use pkg-config to detect gnutls details as well if the existing method
+  (using libgnutls-config) fails. While doing this, I cleaned up and unified
+  the pkg-config usage when detecting openssl and nss as well.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Jan 2009)
+- Karl Moerder brought the patch that creates vc9 Makefiles, and I made
+  'maketgz' now use the actual makefile targets to do the VC8 and VC9
+  makefiles.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (10 Jan 2009)
+- Emil Romanus fixed:
+
+  When using the multi interface over HTTP and the server returns a Location
+  header, the running easy handle will get stuck in the CURLM_STATE_PERFORM
+  state, leaving the external event loop stuck waiting for data from the
+  ingoing socket (when using the curl_multi_socket_action stuff). While this
+  bug was pretty hard to find, it seems to require only a one-line fix. The
+  break statement on line 1374 in multi.c caused the function to skip the call
+  to multistate().
+
+  How to reproduce this bug? Well, that's another question.  evhiperfifo.c in
+  the examples directory chokes on this bug only _sometimes_, probably
+  depending on how fast the URLs are added. One way of testing the bug out is
+  writing to hiper.fifo from more than one source at the same time.
+
+Daniel Fandrich (7 Jan 2009)
+- Unified much of the SessionHandle initialization done in Curl_open() and
+  curl_easy_reset() by creating Curl_init_userdefined(). This had the side
+  effect of fixing curl_easy_reset() so it now also resets
+  CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD and CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE
+
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Jan 2009)
+- Rob Crittenden did once again provide an NSS update:
+
+  I have to jump through a few hoops now with the NSS library initialization
+  since another part of an application may have already initialized NSS by the
+  time Curl gets invoked. This patch is more careful to only shutdown the NSS
+  library if Curl did the initialization.
+
+  It also adds in a bit of code to set the default ciphers if the app that
+  call NSS_Init* did not call NSS_SetDomesticPolicy() or set specific
+  ciphers. One might argue that this lets other application developers get
+  lazy and/or they aren't using the NSS API correctly, and you'd be right.
+  But still, this will avoid terribly difficult-to-trace crashes and is
+  generally helpful.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (1 Jan 2009)
+- 'reconf' is removed since we rather have users use 'buildconf'
+
+Daniel Stenberg (31 Dec 2008)
+- Bas Mevissen reported http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2479030 pointing
+  out that 'reconf' didn't properly point out the m4 subdirectory when running
+  aclocal.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (29 Dec 2008)
+ - Phil Lisiecki filed bug report #2413067
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2413067) that identified a problem that
+  would cause libcurl to mark a DNS cache entry "in use" eternally if the
+  subsequence TCP connect failed. It would thus never get pruned and refreshed
+  as it should've been.
+
+  Phil provided his own patch to this problem that while it seemed to work
+  wasn't complete and thus I wrote my own fix to the problem.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (28 Dec 2008)
+- Peter Korsgaard fixed building libcurl with "configure --with-ssl
+  --disable-verbose".
+  
+- Anthony Bryan fixed more language and spelling flaws in man pages.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (22 Dec 2008)
+- Given a recent enough libssh2, libcurl can now seek/resume with SFTP even
+  on file indexes beyond 2 or 4GB.
+
+- Anthony Bryan provided a set of patches that cleaned up manual language,
+  corrected spellings and more.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Dec 2008)
+- Igor Novoseltsev fixed a bad situation for the multi_socket() API when doing
+  pipelining, as libcurl could then easily get confused and A) work on the
+  handle that was not "first in queue" on a pipeline, or even B) tell the app
+  to REMOVE a socket while it was in use by a second handle in a pipeline. Both
+  errors caused hanging or stalling applications.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (19 Dec 2008)
+- curl_multi_timeout() could return a timeout value of 0 even though nothing
+  was actually ready to get done, as the internal time resolution is higher
+  than the returned millisecond timer. Therefore it could cause applications
+  running on fast processors to do short bursts of busy-loops.
+  curl_multi_timeout() will now only return 0 if the timeout is actually
+  alreay triggered.
+
+- Using the libssh2 0.19 function libssh2_session_block_directions(), libcurl
+  now has an improved ability to do right when the multi interface (both
+  "regular" and multi_socket) is used for SCP and SFTP transfers. This should
+  result in (much) less busy-loop situations and thus less CPU usage with no
+  speed loss.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (17 Dec 2008)
+- SCP and SFTP with the multi interface had the same flaw: the 'DONE'
+  operation didn't complete properly if the EAGAIN equivalent was returned but
+  libcurl would simply continue with a half-completed close operation
+  performed. This ruined persistent connection re-use and cause some

+- Added the possibility to use the Watt-32 tcp/ip stack under Windows.
+  The change simply involved adding a USE_WATT32 section in the
+  config-win32.h files (under ./lib and ./src). This section disables
+  the use of any Winsock headers.

+- libssh2_sftp_last_error() was wrongly used at some places in libcurl which

+- More work with Igor Novoseltsev to first fix the remaining stuff for
+  removing easy handles from multi handles when the easy handle is/was within
+  a HTTP pipeline. His bug report #2351653
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2351653) was also related and was
+  eventually fixed by a patch by Igor himself.

+- Mark Karpeles filed bug report #2416182 titled "crash in ConnectionExists
+  when using duphandle+curl_mutli"
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2416182) which showed that
+  curl_easy_duphandle() wrongly also copied the pointer to the connection
+  cache, which was plain wrong and caused a segfault if the handle would be
+  used in a different multi handle than the handle it was duplicated from.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Dec 2008)
+- Keshav Krity found out that libcurl failed to deal with dotted IPv6
+  addresses if they were very long (>39 letters) due to a too strict address
+  validity parser. It now accepts addresses up to 45 bytes long.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Dec 2008)
+- Internet Explorer had a broken HTTP digest authentication before v7 and
+  there are servers "out there" that relies on the client doing this broken
+  Digest authentication. Apache even comes with an option to work with such
+  broken clients.
+
+  The difference is only for URLs that contain a query-part (a '?'-letter and
+  text to the right of it).
+
+  libcurl now supports this quirk, and you enable it by setting the
+  CURLAUTH_DIGEST_IE bit in the bitmask you pass to the CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH or
+  CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH options. They are thus individually controlled to server
+  and proxy.
+
+  (note that there's no way to activate this with the curl tool yet)
+
+Daniel Fandrich (9 Dec 2008)
+- Added test cases 1089 and 1090 to test --write-out after a redirect to
+  test a report that the size didn't work, but these test cases pass.
+
+- Documented CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY as being useful only on HTTP URLs.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Dec 2008)
+- Ken Hirsch simplified how libcurl does FTPS: now it doesn't assume any
+  particular state for the control connection like it did before for implicit
+  FTPS (libcurl assumed such control connections to be encrypted while some
+  FTPS servers such as FileZilla assumes such connections to be clear
+  mode). Use the CURLOPT_USE_SSL option to set your desired level.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (8 Dec 2008)
+- Fred Machado posted about a weird FTP problem on the curl-users list and when
+  researching it, it turned out he got a 550 response back from a SIZE command
+  and then I fell over the text in RFC3659 that says:
+
+   The presence of the 550 error response to a SIZE command MUST NOT be taken
+   by the client as an indication that the file cannot be transferred in the
+   current MODE and TYPE.
+
+  In other words: the change I did on September 30th 2008 and that has been
+  included in the last two releases were a regression and a bad idea. We MUST
+  NOT take a 550 response from SIZE as a hint that the file doesn't exist.
+
+- Christian Krause filed bug #2221237
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2221237) that identified an infinite
+  loop during GSS authentication given some specific conditions. With his
+  patience and great feedback I managed to narrow down the problem and

+- Igor Novoseltsev filed bug #2351645
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2351645) that identified a problem with
+  the multi interface that occured if you removed an easy handle while in

+
+- Pawel Kierski pointed out a mistake in the cookie code that could lead to a

+
+Daniel Fandrich (25 Nov 2008)
+- If a HTTP request is Basic and num is already >=1000, the HTTP test
+  server adds 1 to num to get the data section to return. This allows
+  testing authentication negotiations using the Basic authentication
+  method.
+
+- Added tests 1087 and 1088 to test Basic authentication on a redirect
+  with and without --location-trusted
+
+Daniel Stenberg (24 Nov 2008)
+- Based on a patch by Vlad Grachov, libcurl now uses a new libssh2 0.19
+  function when built to support SCP and SFTP that helps the library to know
+  in which direction a particular libssh2 operation would return EAGAIN so
+  that libcurl knows what socket conditions to wait for before trying the
+  function call again. Previously (and still when using libssh2 0.18 or
+  earlier), libcurl will busy-loop in this situation when the easy interface
+  is used!

+- I removed the default use of "Pragma: no-cache" from libcurl when a proxy is

+  unless explicitly asked for.
+
+- Josef Wolf's extension that allows a $TESTDIR/gdbinit$testnum file that when
+  you use runtests.pl -g, will be sourced by gdb to allow additional fancy or
+  whatever you see fit
+
+- Christian Krause reported and fixed a memory leak that would occur with HTTP
+  GSS/kerberos authentication (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2284386)
+
+- Andreas Wurf and Markus Koetter helped me analyze a problem that Andreas got
+  when uploading files to a single FTP server using multiple easy handle
+  handles with the multi interface. Occasionally a handle would stall in
+  mysterious ways.
+
+  The problem turned out to be a side-effect of the ConnectionExists()
+  function's eagerness to re-use a handle for HTTP pipelining so it would
+  select it even if already being in use, due to an inadequate check for its
+  chances of being used for pipelnining.
+
+Daniel Fandrich (17 Nov 2008)

+- Added check for NULL returns from strdup() in src/main.c and lib/formdata.c
+  - reported by Jim Meyering also prevent buffer overflow on MSDOS when you do
+  for example -O on a url with a file name part longer than PATH_MAX letters
+
+- lib/nss.c fixes based on the report by Jim Meyering: I went over and added
+  checks for return codes for all calls to malloc and strdup that were
+  missing. I also changed a few malloc(13) to use arrays on the stack and a
+  few malloc(PATH_MAX) to instead use aprintf() to lower memory use.
+
+- I fixed a memory leak in Curl_nss_connect() when CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT is
+  in use.
+
+Daniel Fandrich (14 Nov 2008)
+- Added .xml as one of the few common file extensions known by the multipart

+
+Yang Tse (14 Nov 2008)
+- Fixed several configure script issues affecting checks for inet_ntoa_r(),

 This \fIshare handle\fP is what you pass to curl using the \fICURLOPT_SHARE\fP
 option with \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP, to make that specific curl handle use
 the data in this share.

 <p class="level0"><a name="GLOBAL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">GLOBAL CONSTANTS</h2>
 <p class="level0">There are a variety of constants that libcurl uses, mainly through its internal use of other libraries, which are too complicated for the library loader to set up.  Therefore, a program must call a library function after the program is loaded and running to finish setting up the library code.  For example, when libcurl is built for SSL capability via the GNU TLS library, there is an elaborate tree inside that library that describes the SSL protocol. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span> is the function that you must call.  This may allocate resources (e.g. the memory for the GNU TLS tree mentioned above), so the companion function <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_cleanup()</span> releases them. 
 <p class="level0">The basic rule for constructing a program that uses libcurl is this: Call <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span>, with a <span Class="emphasis">CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</span> argument, immediately after the program starts, while it is still only one thread and before it uses libcurl at all.  Call <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_cleanup()</span> immediately before the program exits, when the program is again only one thread and after its last use of libcurl. 
 <p class="level0">You can call both of these multiple times, as long as all calls meet these requirements and the number of calls to each is the same. 
 <p class="level0">It isn't actually required that the functions be called at the beginning and end of the program -- that's just usually the easiest way to do it. It <span Class="emphasis">is</span> required that the functions be called when no other thread in the program is running. 
 <p class="level0">These global constant functions are <span Class="emphasis">not thread safe</span>, so you must not call them when any other thread in the program is running.  It isn't good enough that no other thread is using libcurl at the time, because these functions internally call similar functions of other libraries, and those functions are similarly thread-unsafe.  You can't generally know what these libraries are, or whether other threads are using them. 
 <p class="level0">The global constant situation merits special consideration when the code you are writing to use libcurl is not the main program, but rather a modular piece of a program, e.g. another library.  As a module, your code doesn't know about other parts of the program -- it doesn't know whether they use libcurl or not.  And its code doesn't necessarily run at the start and end of the whole program. 
-<p class="level0">A module like this must have global constant functions of its own, just like <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span> and <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_cleanup()</span>. The module thus has control at the beginning and end of the program and has a place to call the libcurl functions.  Note that if multiple modules in the program use libcurl, they all will separately call the libcurl functions, and that's OK because only the first <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span> and the last <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_cleanup()</span> in a program changes anything.  (libcurl uses a reference count in static memory).

(libcurl uses a reference count in static memory). 
 <p class="level0">In a C++ module, it is common to deal with the global constant situation by defining a special class that represents the global constant environment of the module.  A program always has exactly one object of the class, in static storage.  That way, the program automatically calls the constructor of the object as the program starts up and the destructor as it terminates.  As the author of this libcurl-using module, you can make the constructor call <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span> and the destructor call <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_cleanup()</span> and satisfy libcurl's requirements without your user having to think about it. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span> has an argument that tells what particular parts of the global constant environment to set up.  In order to successfully use any value except <span Class="emphasis">CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</span> (which says to set up the whole thing), you must have specific knowledge of internal workings of libcurl and all other parts of the program of which it is part. 
 <p class="level0">A special part of the global constant environment is the identity of the memory allocator.  <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span> selects the system default memory allocator, but you can use <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init_mem()</span> to supply one of your own.  However, there is no way to use <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init_mem()</span> in a modular program -- all modules in the program that might use libcurl would have to agree on one allocator. 
 <p class="level0">There is a failsafe in libcurl that makes it usable in simple situations without you having to worry about the global constant environment at all: <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_init()</span> sets up the environment itself if it hasn't been done yet.  The resources it acquires to do so get released by the operating system automatically when the program exits. 
 <p class="level0">This failsafe feature exists mainly for backward compatibility because there was a time when the global functions didn't exist.  Because it is sufficient only in the simplest of programs, it is not recommended for any program to rely on it. <p class="roffit">

Basically, you should use one handle for every thread you plan to use for transferring. You must never share the same handle in multiple threads.

Keep in mind that when you set strings with <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt(3)</a>, libcurl will not copy the data. It will merely point to the data. You MUST make sure that the data remains available for libcurl to use until finished or until you use the same option again to point to something else.

When you set strings with <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt(3)</a>, libcurl makes its own copy so that they don't need to be kept around in your application after being set[4]. 
 <p class="level0">One of the most basic properties to set in the handle is the URL. You set your preferred URL to transfer with CURLOPT_URL in a manner similar to: 
 <p class="level0"><pre>
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_URL, "<a href="http://domain.com/">http://domain.com/</a>");
  </pre>
 
 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">Let's assume for a while that you want to receive data as the URL identifies a remote resource you want to get here. Since you write a sort of application that needs this transfer, I assume that you would like to get the data passed to you directly instead of simply getting it passed to stdout. So, you write your own function that matches this prototype: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;size_t write_data(void *buffer, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userp); 
 <p class="level0">You tell libcurl to pass all data to this function by issuing a function similar to this:

 <p class="level0">Using that property, you can easily pass local data between your application and the function that gets invoked by libcurl. libcurl itself won't touch the data you pass with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</span>. 
 <p class="level0">libcurl offers its own default internal callback that'll take care of the data if you don't set the callback with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</span>. It will then simply output the received data to stdout. You can have the default callback write the data to a different file handle by passing a 'FILE *' to a file opened for writing with the <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</span> option. 
 <p class="level0">Now, we need to take a step back and have a deep breath. Here's one of those rare platform-dependent nitpicks. Did you spot it? On some platforms[2], libcurl won't be able to operate on files opened by the program. Thus, if you use the default callback and pass in an open file with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</span>, it will crash. You should therefore avoid this to make your program run fine virtually everywhere. 
 <p class="level0">(<span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</span> was formerly known as <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_FILE</span>. Both names still work and do the same thing). 
 <p class="level0">If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST use the <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</span> if you set <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</span> - or you will experience crashes. 
 <p class="level0">There are of course many more options you can set, and we'll get back to a few of them later. Let's instead continue to the actual transfer: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;success = curl_easy_perform(easyhandle); 
 <p class="level0"><a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_perform.html">curl_easy_perform(3)</a> will connect to the remote site, do the necessary commands and receive the transfer. Whenever it receives data, it calls the callback function we previously set. The function may get one byte at a time, or it may get many kilobytes at once. libcurl delivers as much as possible as often as possible. Your callback function should return the number of bytes it "took care of". If that is not the exact same amount of bytes that was passed to it, libcurl will abort the operation and return with an error code. 
 <p class="level0">When the transfer is complete, the function returns a return code that informs you if it succeeded in its mission or not. If a return code isn't enough for you, you can use the CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER to point libcurl to a buffer of yours where it'll store a human readable error message as well. 
 <p class="level0">If you then want to transfer another file, the handle is ready to be used again. Mind you, it is even preferred that you re-use an existing handle if you intend to make another transfer. libcurl will then attempt to re-use the previous connection. 
+<p class="level0">For some protocols, downloading a file can involve a complicated process of logging in, setting the transfer mode, changing the current directory and finally transferring the file data. libcurl takes care of all that complication for you.

+<p class="level0">In real-world cases, servers send new cookies to replace existing ones to update them. Server use cookies to "track" users and to keep "sessions". 
 <p class="level0">Cookies are sent from server to clients with the header Set-Cookie: and they're sent from clients to servers with the Cookie: header. 
 <p class="level0">To just send whatever cookie you want to a server, you can use CURLOPT_COOKIE to set a cookie string like this: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_COOKIE, "name1=var1; name2=var2;"); 
-<p class="level0">In many cases, that is not enough. You might want to dynamically save whatever cookies the remote server passes to you, and make sure those cookies are then use accordingly on later requests. 
-<p class="level0">One way to do this, is to save all headers you receive in a plain file and when you make a request, you tell libcurl to read the previous headers to figure out which cookies to use. Set header file to read cookies from with CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE. 
-<p class="level0">The CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE option also automatically enables the cookie parser in libcurl. Until the cookie parser is enabled, libcurl will not parse or understand incoming cookies and they will just be ignored. However, when the parser is enabled the cookies will be understood and the cookies will be kept in memory and used properly in subsequent requests when the same handle is used. Many times this is enough, and you may not have to save the cookies to disk at all. Note that the file you specify to CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE doesn't have to exist to enable the parser, so a common way to just enable the parser and not read able might be to use a file name you know doesn't exist. 
-<p class="level0">If you rather use existing cookies that you've previously received with your Netscape or Mozilla browsers, you can make libcurl use that cookie file as input. The CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE is used for that too, as libcurl will automatically find out what kind of file it is and act accordingly. 
-<p class="level0">The perhaps most advanced cookie operation libcurl offers, is saving the entire internal cookie state back into a Netscape/Mozilla formatted cookie file. We call that the cookie-jar. When you set a file name with CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, that file name will be created and all received cookies will be stored in it when <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_cleanup.html">curl_easy_cleanup(3)</a> is called. This enabled cookies to get passed on properly between multiple handles without any information getting lost.

+<p class="level0">FTP transfers use a second TCP/IP connection for the data transfer. This is usually a fact you can forget and ignore but at times this fact will come back to haunt you. libcurl offers several different ways to customize how the second connection is being made. 
 <p class="level0">libcurl can either connect to the server a second time or tell the server to connect back to it. The first option is the default and it is also what works best for all the people behind firewalls, NATs or IP-masquerading setups. libcurl then tells the server to open up a new port and wait for a second connection. This is by default attempted with EPSV first, and if that doesn't work it tries PASV instead. (EPSV is an extension to the original FTP spec and does not exist nor work on all FTP servers.) 
 <p class="level0">You can prevent libcurl from first trying the EPSV command by setting CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV to zero. 
 <p class="level0">In some cases, you will prefer to have the server connect back to you for the second connection. This might be when the server is perhaps behind a firewall or something and only allows connections on a single port. libcurl then informs the remote server which IP address and port number to connect to. This is made with the CURLOPT_FTPPORT option. If you set it to "-", libcurl will use your system's "default IP address". If you want to use a particular IP, you can set the full IP address, a host name to resolve to an IP address or even a local network interface name that libcurl will get the IP address from. 
 <p class="level0">When doing the "PORT" approach, libcurl will attempt to use the EPRT and the LPRT before trying PORT, as they work with more protocols. You can disable this behavior by setting CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT to zero.

+<p class="level0">To use this interface, you are better off if you first understand the basics of how to use the easy interface. The multi interface is simply a way to make multiple transfers at the same time by adding up multiple easy handles into a "multi stack". 
 <p class="level0">You create the easy handles you want and you set all the options just like you have been told above, and then you create a multi handle with <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_init.html">curl_multi_init(3)</a> and add all those easy handles to that multi handle with <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_add_handle.html">curl_multi_add_handle(3)</a>.

 <p class="level0"><a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform(3)</a> is asynchronous. It will only execute as little as possible and then return back control to your program. It is designed to never block. If it returns CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM you better call it again soon, as that is a signal that it still has local data to send or remote data to receive. 
 <p class="level0">The best usage of this interface is when you do a select() on all possible file descriptors or sockets to know when to call libcurl again. This also makes it easy for you to wait and respond to actions on your own application's sockets/handles. You figure out what to select() for by using <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_fdset.html">curl_multi_fdset(3)</a>, that fills in a set of fd_set variables for you with the particular file descriptors libcurl uses for the moment. 
-<p class="level0">When you then call select(), it'll return when one of the file handles signal action and you then call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform(3)</a> to allow libcurl to do what it wants to do. Take note that libcurl does also feature some time-out code so we advice you to never use very long timeouts on select() before you call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform(3)</a>, which thus should be called unconditionally every now and then even if none of its file descriptors have signaled ready. Another precaution you should use: always call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_fdset.html">curl_multi_fdset(3)</a> immediately before the select() call since the current set of file descriptors may change when calling a curl function.

Remember that easy handles should be <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_cleanup.html">curl_easy_cleanup(3)</a>ed. 
 <p class="level0">When a transfer within the multi stack has finished, the counter of running transfers (as filled in by <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform(3)</a>) will decrease. When the number reaches zero, all transfers are done.

 This release includes the following changes:
 
- o 
+ o CURLAUTH_DIGEST_IE bit added for CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH and CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH
+ o VC9 Makefiles were added to the release package
 
 This release includes the following bugfixes:
 
- o build failure when using MSVC 6 makefile and on four platforms more
- o crash when using --interface name on Linux systems with a TEQL device
- o using the multi interface to download a HTTPS page with libcurl built
-   powered by OpenSSL could download "rubbish" instead of actual content
+ o build failure when disabling FTP but enabling GSS
+ o fixed several calls to memory functions that didn't check return codes
+ o memory leak for SSL connects with libcurl/NSS when CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT was
+   used
+ o re-use of connections with the multi interface when multiple handles used
+   the same server
+ o memory leak with HTTP GSS/kerberos authentication
+ o removed the default use of "Pragma: no-cache"
+ o fix SCP/SFTP busyloop by using a new libssh2 1.0 function
+ o bad fclose() after a fatal error in cookie code
+ o curl_multi_remove_handle() when the handle was in use in a HTTP pipeline
+ o GSS authentication infinite loop problem
+ o 550 response from SIZE no longer treated as missing file
+ o ftps:// control connections now use explicit protection level
+ o dotted IPv6 addresses longer than 39 bytes failed
+ o curl_easy_duphandle() doesn't try to duplicate the connection cache pointer
+ o build failure on OS/400 when enabling IPv6
+ o better detection of SFTP failures
+ o improved connection re-use for subsequent SCP and SFTP transfers
+ o multi interface does less busy-loops for SCP and SFTP transfers with libssh2
+   1.0 or later
+ o curl_multi_timeout() no longer returns timeout 0 when there's still more
+   than 0 but less than 999 microseconds left
+ o the multi_socket API and HTTP pipelining now work a lot better when combined
+ o SFTP seek/resume beyond 32bit file sizes
+ o fixed breakage with --with-ssl --disable-verbose
+ o TTL "leak" in the DNS cache
+ o improved NSS initing
+ o curl_easy_reset now resets more options
+ o rare Location: follow bug with the multi interface
+ o the configure script can now detect gnutls with pkg-config
+ o curlbuild.h was adjusted for SunPro compilers
+ o CURLOPT_COOKIELIST set to "SESS" on an easy handle with no cookies data
+ o fixed timeouts for TFTP
+ o fixed PPC builds
 
 This release includes the following known bugs:
