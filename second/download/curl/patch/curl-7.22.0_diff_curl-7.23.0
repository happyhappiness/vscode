+Version 7.23.0 (14 Nov 2011)
 
-- codestyle: minor whitespace fix
+Dan Fandrich (14 Nov 2011)
+- curl_easy_setopt arguments should be of type long in the examples

+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 10120e6a
+  
+  one more bug fix and contributor
 
-  polarssl: build with PolarSSL-1.0.0
+- progress_cb: avoid buffer overflow
   
-  With this fix, it should work for PolarSSL-1.0.0 (and SVN-1091 trunk)
-  and retain compatibility with earlier versions. (Tested with 0.14.1)
+  The progress bar output function would blindly use the terminal width
+  without bounds checking. When using a very wide terminal that caused a
+  buffer overflow and segfault.
   
-  PolarSSL still doesn't play nicely with curl's CA bundle (we discussed
-  this before) but I was at least able to retrieve the
-  https://www.gmail.com/ login page using a modified ca-certificates.crt
-  file with all 3 versions of PolarSSL.
+  We now limit the max bar with to 255 columns, and I simplified the code
+  to avoid an extra snprintf and buffer.

-- BUGS: revamped bug report documentation
+- ftp PORT: don't hang if bind() fails
+  
+  When the user requests PORT with a specific port or port range, the code
+  could lock up in an endless loop. There's now an extra conditional that
+  makes sure to special treat the error and try the local address only
+  once so a second failure will abort the loop correctly.

-- ftp.c: fix socket leak torture tests detected 2011-08-30
+- test 590: verify the bug fix in 4851dafcf1
   
-  Also fix inappropriate error handling when sending ftp EPRT or PORT commands.
+  This test is created to verify Rene Bernhardt's patch which makes sure

+  proxy says it can serve it.

+
+  HTTP auth: fix proxy Negotiate bug
   
-  Zero-copy and "Avoid having to remove/readd handles" are not really
-  features we think are worthwhile to add. Removed.
+  If a proxy offers several Authentication schemes where NTLM and
+  Negotiate are offered by the proxy and you tell libcurl not to use the
+  Negotiate scheme then the request never returns when the proxy answers
+  with its HTTP 407 reply.
   
-  SRP features have been added already, removed.
+  It is reproducible by the following steps:
   
-  11.9 IPv6 addresses with globbing added
-
-- spell-checked comments
+  - Use a proxy that offers NTLM and Negotiate ( CURLOPT_PROXY and
+  CURLOPT_PROXYPORT )
+  
+  - Tell libcurl NOT to use Negotiate CURL_EASY_SETOPT(CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH,
+  CURLAUTH_BASIC | CURLAUTH_DIGEST | CURLAUTH_NTLM )
+  
+  - Start the request
+  
+  The call to CURL_EASY_PERFORM never returns. If you switch on debug
+  logging you can see that libcurl issues a new request As soon as it
+  received the 407 reply. Instead it should return and set the response
+  code to 407.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-10/0323.html
 
-- TODO-RELEASE: postpone the remainders
+Yang Tse (4 Nov 2011)
+- ssluse.c: fix calling of OpenSSL's ERR_remove_state(0)
   
-  There's three pending bug fixes but there's no time left so let's
-  try to get them fixed for next release...
+  Move calling of ERR_remove_state(0) a.k.a ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL)
+  from Curl_ossl_close_all() to Curl_ossl_cleanup().
+  
+  In this way ERR_remove_state(0) is now only called in libcurl by
+  curl_global_cleanup(). Previously it would get called by functions
+  curl_easy_cleanup(), curl_multi_cleanup and potentially each time a
+  connection was removed from a connection cache leading to premature
+  destruction of OpenSSL's thread local state hash.
+  
+  Multi-threaded apps using OpenSSL enabled libcurl should still call
+  function ERR_remove_state(0) or ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL) at the
+  very end end of threads that do not call curl_global_cleanup().

+Daniel Stenberg (3 Nov 2011)
+- rename ftp_ssl: the struct field is used for many protocols
+  
+  Now called 'use_ssl' instead, which better matches the current CURLOPT
+  name and since the option is used for all pingpong protocols (at least)
+  it makes sense to not use 'ftp' in the name.
 
-- test harness: revert needless commit 0a5bbb2ac1
+Yang Tse (2 Nov 2011)
+- [Daniel Stenberg brought this change]
+
+  gtls_connect_step1: remove use of deprecated functions
   
-  https, ftps and ssh servers allowed start up time back to previous values
+  Use gnutls_priority_set_direct() instead of gnutls_protocol_set_priority().

-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 303c90074d4c
+- FTP test server: NODATACONN commands follow-up
   
-  Five more bugfixes, one more contributor
+  Make NODATACONN425 and NODATACONN421 return a 150 positive preliminary reply
+  before 425 or 421.
+  
+  New NODATACONN150 returns 150 without further positive nor negative reply
+  
+  Now NODATACONN doesn't reply anything at all.
 
-- tcpnodelay: rename variable
+- multi.c: OOM handling fix
+
+- FTP test server: NODATACONN commands follow-up
   
-  Renamed the variable from 'proto' to 'level' simply because it is not
-  protocol you set but level and that is the name of the argument used in
-  man pages and the POSIX documentation of the setsockopt function.
+  Make NODATACONN custom commands apply to both active and passive FTP,
+  and ensure 425 and 421 are not returned unless data channel usage is
+  attempted.

+- FTP test server: NODATACONN commands commit c761fcb0 follow-up
   
-  This workarounds old libssh2 versions not properly initializing
-  some ssh session variables, which would trigger memory debuggers
-  warnings on memory being used without having been initialized.
+  Adjustments that make NODATACONN custom commands fully usable.

+- [Dave Reisner brought this change]
 
-  Curl_speedcheck: don't mistakenly clear Curl_expire()
+  doc/curl.1: fix sentence with ending for -# option
   
-  The current version of speedcheck.c may disable timeout by setting zero
-  to Curl_expire. Which is fine using the curl_multi_perform, because it
-  recheck all timeout internals, but when using custom event poller (like
-  hiperfifo.c) it may keep stalle connection forever.
+  Try to be a little more descriptive about the effect of this flag,
+  rather than parroting what was said in the paragraph just above.

+  Some torture tests left FTP test server in an unresponsive state, resulting
+  in torture tests that actually completed following unexpected code paths.

+  Changes in this commit solely address this issue and some adjustments for
+  ftpserver.pl logging relative to data channel establishment and tear down.

+- lib589.c: add CURLOPT_READDATA missing stuff
 
-- test suite: libtest header inclusion cleanup - follow-up
+- ftpserver.pl: three new custom FTP server commands to disable data channel
   
-  Adjust tests/libtest/Makefile.inc and remove a couple of unused headers from
-  tests/libtest/lib583.c
+  NODATACONN421: applies only to active FTP mode, instructs server to not
+  establish data connection back to client and reply with FTP 421.
+  
+  NODATACONN425: applies only to active FTP mode, instructs server to not
+  establish data connection back to client and reply with FTP 425.
+  
+  NODATACONN: applies to both active and passive FTP modes, instructs server
+  to not establish nor accept a data channel and fool client into believing
+  that the data channel connection is possible.
+  
+  Some polishing probably required.
 
-- test case 583: ensure that test failures don't go unnoticed

+  Fix curl_multi_cleanup() segfault when using weird cleanup sequence.
 
-- test suite: libtest header inclusion cleanup
+Daniel Stenberg (27 Oct 2011)
+- multi: start ftp state machine when switching to DO_MORE
   
-  Added missing memoryTracking to test cases 560 and 583. If this triggers
-  leak detection on these, it only means that previously it was going unnoticed.
+  This extends the fix from commit d7934b8bd491
+  
+  When the multi state is changed within the multi_runsingle from DOING to
+  DO_MORE, we didn't immediately start the FTP state machine again. That
+  then left the FTP state in FTP_STOP. When curl_multi_fdset() was
+  subsequently called, the ftp_domore_getsock() function would return the
+  wrong fd info.

-Guenter Knauf (4 Sep 2011)
-- Fix to skip untrusted certs.
+- test 588: verify active FTP with multi interface without EPRT
+  
+  This is using the verbatim 525 test code but it disables EPRT in the
+  server and this should work just as well anyway.
 
-- Added SPNEGO to MinGW makefiles.
+- FTP server: allow EPRT by default
+  
+  EPRT is now supported by default by the server. To disable it, use the
+  generic REPLY instruction in the <servercmd> tag. Test 116 now has it
+  disabled. All other existing active FTP port tests strip out the port
+  commands from the logs already so the change of the server isn't that
+  noticable.

+Daniel Stenberg (24 Oct 2011)
+- large headers: have curl accept >16K headers
+  
+  As commit 5850cc4808ab clarifies, libcurl can deliver header lines that
+  are longer than CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE, only body data is limited to that
+  size. The curl tool has check (when built debug-enabled) that made the
+  wrong checks and this new test 1205 verifies that larger headers work.

-Dan Fandrich (2 Sep 2011)
-- Fix NTLM winbind support to pass the torture tests
+- [Steve Holme brought this change]
+
+  curl_easy_setopt: Added pop3 to CURLOPT_URL.
   
-  Calling sclose() both in the child and the parent fools the
-  socket leak detector into thinking it's been closed twice.
-  Calling close() in the child instead overcomes this problem. It's
-  not as portable as the sclose() macro, but this code is highly
-  POSIX-specific, anyway.
+  Added pop3 username and password example as well as an explanation of
+  how path part of the URL is used under pop3.
+  
+  Additionally have corrected a couple of typos.

-- MemoryTracking: fix logging of free() calls done where Curl_safefree is called
+Yang Tse (22 Oct 2011)
+- tool_operate.c: OOM handling fix
   
-  Just internal stuff...
+  Move curl_easy_perform source code geneartion out of curl_easy_perform's loop
+  for proper OOM handling and source code geneartion.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (21 Oct 2011)
+- curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
   
-  Curl_safefree is now a macro defined in memdebug.h instead of a function
-  prototyped in url.h and implemented in url.c, so inclusion of url.h is no
-  longer required in order to simply use Curl_safefree.
+  After a PORT has been issued, and the multi handle would switch to the
+  CURLM_STATE_DO_MORE state (which is unique for FTP), libcurl would
+  return the wrong fdset to wait for when curl_multi_fdset() is
+  called. The code would blindly assume that it was waiting for a connect
+  of the second connection, while that isn't true immediately after the
+  PORT command.
   
-  Provide definition of macro WHILE_FALSE in setup_once.h in order to allow
-  other macros such as DEBUGF and DEBUGASSERT, and code using it, to compile
-  without 'conditional expression is constant' warnings.
+  Also, the function multi.c:domore_getsock() was highly FTP-centric and
+  therefore ugly to keep in protocol-agnostic code. I solved this problem
+  by introducing a new function pointer in the Curl_handler struct called
+  domore_getsock() which is only called during the DOMORE state for
+  protocols that set that pointer.
   
-  The WHILE_FALSE stuff fixes 150+ MSVC compiler warnings.
+  The new ftp.c:ftp_domore_getsock() function now returns fdset info about
+  the control connection's command/response handling while such a state is
+  in use, and goes over to waiting for a writable second connection first
+  once the commands are done.
+  
+  The original problem could be seen by running test 525 and checking the
+  time stamps in the FTP server log. I can verify that this fix at least
+  fixes this problem.

-  Follow-up to commit 5eb2396cd as that wasn't complete.
+  Modified smtp_endofresp() to detect NTLM from the server specified list
+  of supported authentication mechanisms.
   
-  At times HEADERFUNCTION+HEADERDATA was set only to have only HEADERDATA
-  set in the subsequent loop which could cause a NULL to get sent as
-  userdata to 'header_callback' which wasn't made to handle that.
+  Modified smtp_authenticate() to start the sending of the NTLM data.
   
-  Now HEADERFUNCTION is explicitly set to NULL if it isn't set to the
-  callback.
+  Added smtp_auth_ntlm_type1_message() which creates a NTLM type-1
+  message. This function is used by authenticate() to start the sending
+  of data and by smtp_state_auth_ntlm_resp() when the AUTH command
+  doesn't contain the type-1 message as part of the initial response.
+  This lack of initial response can happen if an OOM error occurs or the
+  type-1 message is longer than 504 characters. As the main AUTH command
+  is limited to 512 character the data has to be transmitted in two
+  parts; one containing the AUTH NTLM and the second containing the
+  type-1 message.
+  
+  Added smtp_state_auth_ntlm_type2msg_resp() which handles the incoming
+  type-2 message and sends an outgoing type-3 message. This type-2
+  message is sent by the server in response to our type-1 message.
+  
+  Modified smtp_state_auth_resp() to handle the response to: the AUTH
+  NTLM without the initial response and the type-2 response.
+  
+  Modified smtp_disconnect() to cleanup the NTLM SSPI stack.

+- multi: progress function abort must close connection
   
-  When using the multi interface, a SOCKS proxy, and a connection that

-  SOCKS proxy when it setup the data connection and then of course the
-  second attempt would fail miserably and cause error.
+  When the progress function returns to cancel the request, we must mark
+  the connection to get closed and it must do to the DONE state.
   
-  This problem is a regression that was introduced by commit
-  4a42e5cdaa344755 that was introduced in the 7.21.7 release.
+  do_init() must be called as early as possible so that state variables
+  for new connections are reset early. We could otherwise see that the old
+  values were still there when a connection was to be disconnected very
+  early and it would make it behave wrongly.

-  All AIX autobuilds fails unit tests linking against unittests library due to
-  unittests library being built with no symbols or members. Libtool ?
+  Removed the code that striped off the domain name when Curl_gethostname
+  returned the fully qualified domain name as the function has been
+  updated to return the un-qualified host name.
+  
+  Replaced the use of HOSTNAME_MAX as the size of the buffer in the call
+  to Curl_gethostname with sizeof(host) as this is safer should the buffer
+  size ever be changed.

+- POST: always set postfieldsize
   
-  291 - bug 3383692 "GET PARAMETER request and body in response"
+  When we use binary posts and regular ones intermixed on a single command
+  line, we cannot do strlen() etc on the data to figure out the length
+  (when inserting '&' and more). We must therefore keep track of the post
+  data length. Then we also end up setting the libcurl option with the
+  known size, so that we don't risk that libcurl will do strlen() on the
+  data.
+  
+  This has the minor side-effect that --libcurl source codes now always
+  will use CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE but I don't consider that terribly
+  damaging.

+- test 814: smtp without --mail-from
   
-  This 'refactoring' has been prepared by previous commits to allow that this

-  goodness and badness previous to this commit should remain the same once it is

+
+  smtp: without a MAIL_FROM, send blank MAIL FROM
   
-  Given the quite big portions of code being moved around, and the importance of
-  change traceability, this commit has been done in such a way that it is
-  possible to perform a three-way diff from initial http_ntlm.[ch] to resulting
-  http_ntlm.[ch] and curl_ntlm.[ch] to actually verify that no functional change
-  is introduced here.
+  I think curl should ignore this case and smtp.c should test for this.
+  Since RFC-2821 seems to allow a "null reverse-path". Ref.  "MAIL
+  FROM:<>" in section 3.7, page 25.

-  case by case basis, so, I had to bite the bullet ;-)
+  Example:
+  * upload completely sent off: 35out of 35 bytes
   
-  Comments, line adjustments, compiler warning fixes, whatever, may follow
-  afterwards.

-Yang Tse (4 Aug 2011)
-- BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack support:
-  
-  Allow compilation of libcurl and curl using BSD-style lwIP on Win32.
-  
-  In order to compile libcurl and curl with this support it is necessary
-  to edit files lib/config-win32.h and src/config-win32.h and uncomment
-  a line to make definition of preprocessor symbol USE_LWIPSOCK visible.
-  
-  Afterwards you can compile as usual.
-  
-  In order to use compiled library with BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack in
-  your program it is mandatory that you include lwIP header file <lwip/opt.h>
-  before including <curl/curl.h> or <curl/multi.h>
-  
-  Compilation has been verified with lwIP 1.4.0 and contrib-1.4.0 from:

-  For test harness, prefix NTLM_AUTH environment vars with CURL_

+- NTLM: END of refactoring/splitting/moving
   
-  When an easy handle is used to download an URI which has no
-  Content-Length header (or equivalent) after downloading an URI which
-  does, the value from the previous transfer is reused and returned by
-  CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD. This is because the progress flags

-  Autobuild submitters can use this to add some text to their
-  setup files to describe issues they've found with the build
-  or tests. This could include laying blame on test failures on
-  network issues or dependent libraries, explaining away compiler
-  warnings or providing any additional information that could be
-  useful to people reviewing and investigating problems with the
-  publicly available autobuild logs.  Note that persistent test
-  failures that are not issues with curl itself should normally be
-  fixed by excluding them from the test run instead.
+  When using the multi interface, a SOCKS proxy, and a connection that
+  wouldn't immediately consider itself connected (which my Linux tests do
+  by default), libcurl would be tricked into doing _two_ connects to the
+  SOCKS proxy when it setup the data connection and then of course the
+  second attempt would fail miserably and cause error.
   
-  This is an entirely optional field that is not entered by the

+- MemoryTracking: adjust curl_domalloc() and curl_dofree() memory filling
   
-  libcurl inappropriate GSSAPI delegation. Full details at
-  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20110623.html
+  Until 2011-08-17 libcurl's Memory Tracking feature also performed
+  automatic malloc and free filling operations using 0xA5 and 0x13
+  values. Our own preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory
+  might be useful when not using third party memory debuggers, but
+  on the other hand this would fool memory debuggers into thinking
+  that all dynamically allocated memory is properly initialized.
+  
+  As a default setting, libcurl's Memory Tracking feature no longer
+  performs preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory on its
+  own. If you know what you are doing, and really want to retain old
+  behavior, you can achieve this compiling with preprocessor symbols
+  CURL_MT_MALLOC_FILL and CURL_MT_FREE_FILL defined with appropriate
+  values.

-- curl_formget: fix FILE * leak
+- telnet: allow programatic use on Windows
   
-  Properly deal with the fact that the last fread() call most probably is
-  a short read, and when using callbacks in fact all calls can be short
-  reads. No longer consider a file read done until it returns a 0 from the
-  read function.
+  Summary of the issue can be found at:
+  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-04/0367.html
   
-  Reported by: Aaron Orenstein
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-06/0048.html
+  That patch only updated the unix sockets code - the winsock code was not
+  updated and no longer works the same was as the unix code. This change
+  updates the windows code accordingly.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3163118
 
-- curl_formget: treat CURLFORM_STREAM better
+- TODO-RELEASE: fixed issue #291
   
-  If a piece is set to use a callback to get the data, it should not be
-  treated as data. It unfortunately also requires that curl_easy_perform()
-  or similar has been used as otherwise the callback function hasn't been
-  figured out and curl_formget won't know how to get the content.
+  291 - bug 3383692 "GET PARAMETER request and body in response"
 
-- curl_formget.3: CURLFORM_STREAM has its drawbacks
+Yang Tse (14 Aug 2011)
+- http NTLM: reinstate "memdebug.h" header inclusion
   
-  Due to a design flaw, the CURLFORM_STREAM option doesn't really work
-  with curl_formget until after curl_easy_perform (or similar).

+- http NTLM: add curl_ntlm.c to Symbian's libcurl.mmp
 
-- write: add return code checks when used
+- http NTLM: fix 8 compiler warnings
   
-  These were just warnings in test code but it still makes it nicer to not
-  generate them.
+  Strict splitting of http_ntlm.[ch] may trigger 8 compiler warnings when
+  building with some compilers and strict compiler warnings enabled, depending
+  on other specific configuration options some could get triggered or not.
+  
+  Seven are related with 'unused function parameters' and another one with
+  'var may be used before its value is set'.
 
-- long/int mess
+- http NTLM: split http_ntlm.[ch] between http_ntlm.[ch] and curl_ntlm.[ch]
   
-  Typecast when converting to int from long to avoid some compiler warnings
+  For modularity purposes, huge chunks of NTLM existing code is transformed into
+  functions to allow future internal code reuse.
+  
+  Resulting three new libcurl private functions:
+  
+   - Curl_ntlm_create_type1_message()
+   - Curl_ntlm_create_type3_message()
+   - Curl_ntlm_decode_type2_message()
+  
+  Changing static ntlm_sspi_cleanup() into non-static Curl_ntlm_sspi_cleanup()
+  
+  This 'refactoring' has been prepared by previous commits to allow that this
+  specific one does not introduce any change to existing code. All existing
+  goodness and badness previous to this commit should remain the same once it is
+  applied, the only difference should be that existing code is moved into
+  functions.
+  
+  Given the quite big portions of code being moved around, and the importance of
+  change traceability, this commit has been done in such a way that it is
+  possible to perform a three-way diff from initial http_ntlm.[ch] to resulting
+  http_ntlm.[ch] and curl_ntlm.[ch] to actually verify that no functional change
+  is introduced here.
+  
+  Notice that Steve Holme has provided several patches, but these included this
+  refactoring along with 'extra' fixes. I really wanted this 'clean' refactoring
+  done first, in order to allow discussion or committing of 'extra' fixes on a
+  case by case basis, so, I had to bite the bullet ;-)
+  
+  Comments, line adjustments, compiler warning fixes, whatever, may follow
+  afterwards.

-- SFTP: close file before postquote
+Dan Fandrich (23 Jun 2011)
+- Display notes from setup file in testcurl.pl
   
-  Make sure that files are closed before the post quote commands run as if
-  they operate on the just transferred file they could otherwise easily
-  fail.
+  Autobuild submitters can use this to add some text to their
+  setup files to describe issues they've found with the build
+  or tests. This could include laying blame on test failures on
+  network issues or dependent libraries, explaining away compiler
+  warnings or providing any additional information that could be
+  useful to people reviewing and investigating problems with the
+  publicly available autobuild logs.  Note that persistent test
+  failures that are not issues with curl itself should normally be
+  fixed by excluding them from the test run instead.
   
-  Patch by: Rajesh Naganathan (edited)
+  This is an entirely optional field that is not entered by the
+  user the first time a new build is created.

+  unitteset: Curl_llist_move
   
-  The new libcurl and command line options are now described.
+  adding unit test for Curl_llist_move, documenting unit-tested functions
+  in llist.c, changing unit-test to unittest, replacing assert calls with
+  abort_unless calls
 
-- transfer-encoding: added new option and cmdline
+- CURLFORM_STREAM: acknowledge CURLFORM_FILENAME
   
-  Added CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING as the option to set to request Transfer
-  Encoding in HTTP requests (if built zlib enabled). I also renamed
-  CURLOPT_ENCODING to CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING (while keeping the old name
-  around) to reduce the confusion when we have to encoding options for
-  HTTP.
+  The CURLFORM_STREAM is documented to only insert a file name (and thus
+  look like a file upload) in the part if CURLFORM_FILENAME is set, but in
+  reality it always inserted a filename="" and if CURLFORM_FILENAME wasn't
+  set, it would insert insert rubbish (or possibly crash).
   
-  --tr-encoding is now the new command line option for curl to request
-  this, and thus I updated the test cases accordingly.
+  This is now fixed to work as documented, and test 554 has been extended
+  to verify this.

+Yang Tse (17 Jun 2011)
+- configure: avoid direct usage of AS_TR_* macros
 
-- TE: do the Connection: header
-  
-  When TE: is inserted in the request, we must add a "Connection: TE" as
-  well to be HTTP 1.1 compliant. If a custom Connection: header is passed
-  in, we must use that and only append TE to it. Test case 1125 verifies
-  TE: + custom Connection:.

-- TE: rename struct field content_encoding
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 0aedccc18a33a778535

+- curl_formget: fix FILE * leak
   
-  Since this struct member is used in the code to determine what and how
-  to decode automatically and since it is now also used for compressed
-  Transfer-Encodings, I renamed it to the more suitable 'auto_decoding'
-
-- HTTP: add support for gzip and deflate Transfer-Encoding
-  
-  Transfer-Encoding differs from Content-Encoding in a few subtle ways,
-  but primarily it concerns the transfer only and not the content so when
-  discovered to be compressed we know we have to uncompress it. There will
-  only arrive compressed transfers in a response after we have requested
-  them with the appropriate TE: header.
+  Properly deal with the fact that the last fread() call most probably is
+  a short read, and when using callbacks in fact all calls can be short
+  reads. No longer consider a file read done until it returns a 0 from the
+  read function.

-  curl-config --version didn't output the correct version string (bug
-  introduced in commit 0355e33b5f7b234cf3), and unfortunately the test
-  case 1022 that was supposed to check for this was broken.
+  If a piece is set to use a callback to get the data, it should not be
+  treated as data. It unfortunately also requires that curl_easy_perform()
+  or similar has been used as otherwise the callback function hasn't been
+  figured out and curl_formget won't know how to get the content.
+
+- curl_formget.3: CURLFORM_STREAM has its drawbacks
   
-  This change fixes the test to detect this problem and it fixes the
-  output.
+  Due to a design flaw, the CURLFORM_STREAM option doesn't really work

-  
-  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION
-  
-  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN replaces return code 4 that has been obsoleted for
-  several years. It is used for returning error when something is
-  attempted to be used but the feature/option was not enabled or
-  explictitly disabled at build-time. Getting this error mostly means that
-  libcurl needs to be rebuilt.
-  
-  CURLE_FAILED_INIT is now saved and used strictly for init
-  failures. Getting this problem means something went seriously wrong,
-  like a resource shortage or similar.
-  
-  CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION is the option formerly known as
-  CURLE_UNKNOWN_TELNET_OPTION (and the old name is still present,
-  separately defined to be removed in a very distant future). This error
-  code is meant to be used to return when an option is given to libcurl

+- [Jari Aalto brought this change]
+
+  curl.1: use GNU style and sort options
   
-  When NSS-powered libcurl connected to a SSL server with

-  certificate was accepted by libcurl and did not ask the second time when
-  connecting to the same server with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to one.
+  Follow style of GNU layout (cp, mv ...) where options are separated with
+  comma: -o, --option
   
-  This patch turns off the SSL session cache for the particular SSL socket
-  if peer verification is disabled.  In order to avoid any performance
-  impact, the peer verification is completely skipped in that case, which
-  makes it even faster than before.

-- protocols: use CURLPROTO_ internally
+- url encode docs: mention '-', '.', '_' and '~'
   
-  The PROT_* set of internal defines for the protocols is no longer
-  used. We now use the same bits internally as we have defined in the
-  public header using the CURLPROTO_ prefix. This is for simplicity and
-  because the PROT_* prefix was already used duplicated internally for a
-  set of KRB4 values.
+  Clarify that the '-', '.', '_' or '~' letters are also not escaped since
+  they shouldn't according to RFC3986 section 2.3.
   
-  The PROTOPT_* defines were moved up to just below the struct definition
-  within which they are used.
+  This is how this function has behaved since sep 2010, commit
+  5df13c31735fa0.
 
-- protocol handler: added flags field
+- SSH: set non-blocking earlier
   
-  The protocol handler struct got a 'flags' field for special information
-  and characteristics of the given protocol.
+  Introduce an INIT state for the SSH state machine and set libssh2
+  non-blocking in that so that it is set properly before
+  libssh2_session_startup() is called.
   
-  This now enables us to move away central protocol information such as
-  CLOSEACTION and DUALCHANNEL from single defines in a central place, out
-  to each protocol's definition. It also made us stop abusing the protocol
-  field for other info than the protocol, and we could start cleaning up
-  other protocol-specific things by adding flags bits to set in the
-  handler struct.
-  
-  The "protocol" field connectdata struct was removed as well and the code
-  now refers directly to the conn->handler->protocol field instead. To
-  make things work properly, the code now always store a conn->given
-  pointer that points out the original handler struct so that the code can
-  learn details from the original protocol even if conn->handler is
-  modified along the way - for example when switching to go over a HTTP
-  proxy.

-- SSH: add protocol lock direction
-  
-  Some protocols have to call the underlying functions without regard to
-  what exact state the socket signals. For example even if the socket says
-  "readable", the send function might need to be called while uploading,
-  or vice versa. This is the case for libssh2 based protocols: SCP and

+- lib/make: run checksrc.pl once for all files
   
-  This is one of the problems detected by test 582.

+  problems for more file than one at a time - more convenient.
 
-- readwrite_upload: stop upload at file size
+- checksrc: scan many files, more checks
   
-  As we know how much to send, we can and should stop once we've sent that
-  much data as it avoids having to rely on other mechanisms to detect the
-  end.
+  It now scans multiple files and outputs an error+warning count summary
+  at the end in case at least one was detected.

-- sftp upload: expire to advance state machine
-  
-  When using the multi_socket API to do SFTP upload, it is important that
-  we set a quick expire when leaving the SSH_SFTP_UPLOAD_INIT state as

+Daniel Stenberg (20 Apr 2011)
+- Curl_http_connect: detect HTTPS properly after CONNECT
   
-  The stopserver function would append pids to kill and could append them
-  without separating them with space properly. The result would be a very
-  large number that by (some implementations of) kill would be interpreted
-  as a negative number and that process group would be wiped...
+  libcurl failed to check the correct struct for HTTPS after CONNECT was

-  multi: close connection on timeout
+Daniel Stenberg (18 Apr 2011)
+- transfer-encoding: document the options
   
-  After a request times out, the connection wasn't properly closed and
-  prevented to get re-used, so subsequent transfers could still mistakenly
-  get to use the previously aborted connection.
+  The new libcurl and command line options are now described.
 
-- multi: better failed connect treatment
-  
-  When failing to connect the protocol during the CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT
-  state, Curl_done() has to be called with the premature flag set TRUE as
-  for the pingpong protocols this can be important.
-  
-  When Curl_done() is called with premature == TRUE, it needs to call
-  Curl_disconnect() with its 'dead_connection' argument set to TRUE as
-  well so that any protocol handler's disconnect function won't attempt to
-  use the (control) connection for anything.
+- transfer-encoding: added new option and cmdline
   
-  This problem caused the pingpong protocols to fail to disconnect when
-  STARTTLS failed.
+  Added CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING as the option to set to request Transfer
+  Encoding in HTTP requests (if built zlib enabled). I also renamed
+  CURLOPT_ENCODING to CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING (while keeping the old name

+  
+  Since this struct member is used in the code to determine what and how
+  to decode automatically and since it is now also used for compressed
+  Transfer-Encodings, I renamed it to the more suitable 'auto_decoding'
 
-- SOCKOPTFUNCTION: callback can say already-connected
+- HTTP: add support for gzip and deflate Transfer-Encoding
   
-  Introducing a few CURL_SOCKOPT* defines for conveniance. The new
-  CURL_SOCKOPT_ALREADY_CONNECTED signals to libcurl that the socket is to
-  be treated as already connected and thus it will skip the connect()
-  call.
+  Transfer-Encoding differs from Content-Encoding in a few subtle ways,
+  but primarily it concerns the transfer only and not the content so when
+  discovered to be compressed we know we have to uncompress it. There will
+  only arrive compressed transfers in a response after we have requested
+  them with the appropriate TE: header.
+  
+  Test case 1122 and 1123 verify.

-  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
-  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
-  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems

+  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to zero, NSS remembered that the peer
+  certificate was accepted by libcurl and did not ask the second time when
+  connecting to the same server with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to one.
+  
+  This patch turns off the SSL session cache for the particular SSL socket
+  if peer verification is disabled.  In order to avoid any performance
+  impact, the peer verification is completely skipped in that case, which
+  makes it even faster than before.

-- curlcheck.h: add fail_if() fix code
+- protocols: use CURLPROTO_ internally
   
-  The UNITTEST_START and UNITTEST_STOP defines needed to do a new brace
-  level so that test cases can declare variables fine and still remain
-  fine C89 code.
+  The PROT_* set of internal defines for the protocols is no longer
+  used. We now use the same bits internally as we have defined in the
+  public header using the CURLPROTO_ prefix. This is for simplicity and
+  because the PROT_* prefix was already used duplicated internally for a
+  set of KRB4 values.
+  
+  The PROTOPT_* defines were moved up to just below the struct definition
+  within which they are used.
 
-- unittests: basic docs
+- protocol handler: added flags field
+  
+  The protocol handler struct got a 'flags' field for special information
+  and characteristics of the given protocol.
+  
+  This now enables us to move away central protocol information such as
+  CLOSEACTION and DUALCHANNEL from single defines in a central place, out
+  to each protocol's definition. It also made us stop abusing the protocol
+  field for other info than the protocol, and we could start cleaning up
+  other protocol-specific things by adding flags bits to set in the
+  handler struct.
+  
+  The "protocol" field connectdata struct was removed as well and the code
+  now refers directly to the conn->handler->protocol field instead. To
+  make things work properly, the code now always store a conn->given
+  pointer that points out the original handler struct so that the code can
+  learn details from the original protocol even if conn->handler is
+  modified along the way - for example when switching to go over a HTTP
+  proxy.

-- SFTP: make pwd output result to header callback
+- SSH: add protocol lock direction
   
-  Sending "pwd" as a QUOTE command only sent the reply to the
-  DEBUGFUNCTION. Now it also sends an FTP-like header to the header
-  callback to allow similar operations as with FTP, and apps can re-use
-  the same parser.
-
-- pubkey_show: allocate buffer to fit any-size result
+  Some protocols have to call the underlying functions without regard to
+  what exact state the socket signals. For example even if the socket says
+  "readable", the send function might need to be called while uploading,
+  or vice versa. This is the case for libssh2 based protocols: SCP and
+  SFTP and we now introduce a define to set those protocols and we make
+  the multi interface code aware of this concept.
   
-  The loop condition was wrong so keys larger than 340 bits would overflow
-  the local stack-based buffer.
+  This is another fix to make test 582 run properly.

-- cookies: tricked dotcounter fixed
+- test582: enabled
+
+- PROT_CLOSEACTION: added SFTP and SCP
   
-  Providing multiple dots in a series in the domain field (domain=..com) could
-  trick the cookie engine to wrongly accept the cookie believing it to be
-  fine. Since the tailmatching would then match all .com sites, the cookie would
-  then be sent to all of them.
+  Both SFTP and SCP are protocols that need to shut down stuff properly
+  when the connection is about to get torned down. The primary effect of
+  not doing this shows up as memory leaks (when using SCP or SFTP with the
+  multi interface).
   
-  The code now requires at least one letter between each dot for them to be
-  counted. Edited test case 61 to verify this.
+  This is one of the problems detected by test 582.
 
-- multi: connect fail => use next IP address
+- readwrite_upload: stop upload at file size
   
-  When using the multi interface and connecting to a host name that
-  resolves to multiple IP addresses, there was no logic that made it
-  continue to the next IP if connecting to the first address times
-  out. This is now corrected.
-
-- smtp-multi: put recipient within <brackets>
+  As we know how much to send, we can and should stop once we've sent that
+  much data as it avoids having to rely on other mechanisms to detect the
+  end.
   
-  Even if libcurl might to do it for us, it is more correct.
-
-- ossl_seed: no more RAND_screen
+  This is one of the problems detected by test 582.
   
-  RAND_screen() is slow, not thread-safe and not needed anymore since OpenSSL
-  uses the thread-safe win32 CryptoAPI nowadays.

-- multi: inhibit some verbose outputs
+- sftp upload: expire to advance state machine
   
-  The info about pipe status and expire cleared are clearly debug-related

-
-- SMTP tests: updated MAIL FROM use
+  When using the multi_socket API to do SFTP upload, it is important that
+  we set a quick expire when leaving the SSH_SFTP_UPLOAD_INIT state as
+  there's nothing happening on the socket so there's no read or write to
+  wait for, but the next libssh2 API function needs to be called to get
+  the ball rolling.
   
-  They were all wrong previously since none used the <brackets> they
-  should for MAIL FROM. Now libcurl adds them itself if the app doesn't so
-  they end up wrong less easy.

-  The public axTLS header (at least as of 1.2.7) redefines the memory

-  ossl_connect_common: detect connection re-use
+Julien Chaffraix (10 Feb 2011)

-  ossl_connect_common() now checks whether or not 'struct
-  connectdata->state' is equal 'ssl_connection_complete' and if so, will
-  return CURLE_OK with 'done' set to 'TRUE'. This check prevents
-  ossl_connect_common() from creating a new ssl connection on an existing

+
+  CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED: removed
   
-  It helps to prevent a hangup with some FTP servers in case idle session
-  timeout has exceeded.  But it may be useful also for other protocols
-  that send any quit message on disconnect.  Currently used by FTP, POP3,
-  IMAP and SMTP.
+  On second thought, I think CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED should be eliminated. It
+  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
+  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
+  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems
+  appropriate; its error string already includes "passwords" as a possible
+  cause. Having a separate TLS auth error code might also cause people to
+  think that a TLS auth failure means the wrong username or password was
+  entered, when it could also be a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack.

-- curl.1: --resolve documented
+Guenter Knauf (13 Jan 2011)
+- Use env var for PSDK instead of hardcoded path.

-- xattr-check: correct the comment as well
+Yang Tse (12 Jan 2011)
+- docs - update BCC INSTALL section
 
-- xattr: use const char * for const strings
+- build: BCC - require Borlands's MAKE for Makefile.b32 processing.
 
-- setxattr: fix the checks
+- build: BCC - recover lost functionality from commit 3d813204260b37289411
   
-  My copy and paste job was a little too much copy and I missed to adjust
-  it properly to sys/xattr.h all over and this is a fix to cure that.
+  Borland's $(MAKEDIR) expands to the path where make.exe is located,
+  use this feature to define BCCDIR when user has not defined BCCDIR.
 
-- CURLOPT_RESOLVE: added
-  
-  CURLOPT_RESOLVE is a new option that sends along a curl_slist with
-  name:port:address sets that will populate the DNS cache with entries so
-  that request can be "fooled" to use another host than what otherwise
-  would've been used. Previously we've encouraged the use of Host: for
-  that when dealing with HTTP, but this new feature has the added bonus
-  that it allows the name from the URL to be used for TLS SNI and server
-  certificate name checks as well.
-  
-  This is a first change. Surely more will follow to make it decent.

+- connect: use UDP correctly
+  
+  The idea that the protocol and socktype is part of name resolving in the
+  libc functions is nuts. We keep the name resolver functions assume
+  TCP/STREAM and we make sure that when we want to connect to a UDP
+  service we use the correct UDP/DGRAM set instead. This bug was because
+  the ->protocol field was not always set correctly.
   
-  Removed the code that was needed for libcurl before 7.19.0 which now is
-  more than two years old.
+  This bug was only affecting ipv6-disabled non-cares non-threaded builds.

-  LDAP: detect non-binary attributes properly
-  
-  If the query result has a binary attribute, the binary attribute is
-  base64 encoded. But all following non binary attributes are also base64

-  This is a test (LDAP server is public).

-  save metadata to extended file attributes
+  HTTP: HTTP Negotiate authentication using SSPI
   
-  It is often convinient to track back the source of a once downloaded
-  file; this patch makes curl store the source URL and other metadata
-  alongside the retrieved file by using the extended attributes (if
-  supported by the file system and enabled by --xattr).
+  Only under Windows
 
-- test: remove test 580
-  
-  Test 580 is removed again for two reasons:
-  
-  1) Some compilers aren't satisfied by just a data variable called 'test'
-  when first.o wants a function called 'test'. The Solaris compiler says
-  "ld: warning: symbol `test' has differing types:" while the AIX compiler
-  downright rejects it.
+- cmake: removed two files
   
-  2) Test case 1119 that was added after this test is way more complete
-  and cover everything test 580 does and more without introducing the same
-  problems.
+  CMake/CheckTypeSize.c.in and CMake/CheckTypeSize.cmake were removed in
+  the previous cmake commit
 
-- Revert: use Host: name for SNI and cert name checks
+Dan Fandrich (5 Jan 2011)
+- Made unit_setup() return an error code to abort the test early

-  4b2fbe1e97891f, afecd1aa13b4f, 68cde058f66b3
+  This makes it possible to skip the call to unit_stop() in such
+  cases.  Also use Curl_safefree() in unit test 1302 so it will
+  pass the memory torture test.

-- certcheck: use the custom Host: name for checks
+  CMake: Use upstream CheckTypeSize module
   
-  If you use a custom Host: name in a request to a SSL server, libcurl
-  will now use that given name when it verifies the server certificate to
-  be correct rather than using the host name used in the actual URL.
-
-- SNI: simplify the custom host name use
+  The CheckTypeSize module that comes with CMake 2.6.2 and above does
+  everything we need and also supports cross-compiling.  Avoid duplicating
+  an older version of it here.  This also fixes a cross-compiling error
+  because the old line
+  
+    include ("${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}/CheckTypeSize.cmake")
+  
+  failed because CMAKE_MODULE_PATH is a search path and not a directory.
   
-  The redirect check is already done at the position where the customhost
-  field is assigned so there's no point in doing that a second time.
+  Signed-off-by: Brad King <brad.king@kitware.com>
 
-- host: get the custom Host: name more genericly
+- SSH: acknowledge speedcheck
   
-  When given a custom host name in a Host: header, we can use it for
-  several different purposes other than just cookies, so we rename it and
-  use it for SSL SNI etc.
+  Check for speedcheck limits during the state machine traversals

-  SNI: set name to custom Host header

-  OpenSSL SNI host name should be set to the custom Host header, if the
-  user provided one.

+  correct return code.
 
-- fopen.c: re-indented, fixed previous mistake
-  
-  I've made the code intended using curl-style now to look more like other
-  examples.
+- curlcheck.h: add fail()
   
-  My previous "fix" was a bit too invasive but is now fixed again.
-
-- multi use: call multi_perform even on select() timeouts
+  fail is a new function/macro that a test case can use to indicate a test
+  failure for cases when the standard macros are not sufficient.
 
-- example: add smtp-multi.c
+- Curl_timeleft: s/conn/data in first argument
   
-  An example application source code sending SMTP mail with the multi
-  interface. It is based on the code Alona Rossen provided, which in turn
-  is based on existing example/test code, and I converted it even more
-  into a decent example with a fair multi API use, put the info required
-  to edit at the top and I added some comments.
+  As the function doesn't really use the connectdata struct but only the
+  SessionHanadle struct I modified what argument it wants.

-  
-  If a command is set type="perl", it can now specify a perl program that will
-  be run instead of an ordinary curl or built tool.
-  
-  A perl test automatically disables memory and valgrind debugging.
+- unittest: test base64 encode/decode
 
-- symbol-scan: verifies symbols-in-versions
-  
-  This new script scans for all enums and #defines used by the curl/curl.h
-  and curl/multi.h headers. Then it reads all symbols mentioned in
-  symbols-in-vesions and make sure that there's no entries missing in
-  there. It then proceeds to verify that the entries that
-  symbols-in-vesions mentions but aren't found in the sources are truly
-  documented as removed.
-  
-  This script is used in the new test case 1119
+- curlcheck.h: avoid using NULL pointers
 
-- symbols-in-versions: added 119 missing symbols
-  
-  I've developed a script I call symbol-scan.pl that scans the curl.h and
-  multi.h header files and compare the symbols it finds in there with the
-  symbols symbols-in-versions documents and outputs a report on the
-  differences.  Using this I've dug through the history to fill up
-  symbols-in-versions with all the symbols my script found mismatches for.
+- curlcheck.h: add verify_memory
   
-  I will commit symbol-scan.pl separatly and think of a way to put it to
-  use in the build/tests so that we from now on will get this in-sync
-  check automatically.

-  named lib580.c and if that compiles fine we know that the file
-  docs/libcurl/symbols-in-versions at least doesn't include any symbols
-  that are misspelled.
+  512 bytes turned out too short for some data, so now we allocate a
+  larger buffer instead
   
-  An additional feature would be to somehow scan curl/curl.h and compare

-  These haven't worked in at least 8 years due to missing source
-  files, and most active RiscOS developers these days apparently
-  cross-compile anyway.
+  The test runner script now knows if unittests can run and the unit test

-- SSH: use libssh2_session_handshake()
+- SSH: avoid PATH_MAX with alloc
   
-  In libssh2 1.2.8, libssh2_session_handshake() replaces
-  libssh2_session_startup() to fix the previous portability problem with
-  the socket type that was too small for win64 and thus easily could cause
-  crashes and more.
+  We cannot assume that PATH_MAX will be enough for the remote path name
+  so allocating room for it is the only sensible approach.
 
-- SSH: avoid using the libssh2_ prefix
-  
-  It is a bad idea to use the public prefix used by another library and
-  now we realize that libssh2 introduces a symbol in the upcoming version
-  1.2.8 that conflicts with our static function named libssh2_free.
+- TODO: get rid of PATH_MAX
 
-- formdata: provide error message
+- Curl_nss_connect: avoid PATH_MAX
   
-  When failing to build form post due to an error, the code now does a
-  proper failf(). Previously libcurl would report an error like "failed
-  creating formpost data" when a file wasn't possible to open which was
-  not easy for users to figure out.
+  Since some systems don't have PATH_MAX and it isn't that clever to
+  assume a fixed maximum path length, the code now allocates buffer space
+  instead of using stack.
   
-  I also lower cased a function name to be named more curl-style and
-  removed some unnecessary code.

-- URL-parsing: consider ? a divider
-  
-  The URL parser got a little stricter as it now considers a ? to be a
-  host name divider so that the slightly sloppier URLs work too. The
-  problem that made me do this change was the reported problem with an URL
-  like: www.example.com?email=name@example.com This form of URL is not
-  really a legal URL (due to the missing slash after the host name) but is
-  widely accepted by all major browsers and libcurl also already accepted
-  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
-  
-  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the
-  ?  letter as part of user-name or password when given in the URL, which
-  it used to accept (and is tested in test 191). That letter is however
-  mentioned in RFC3986 to be required to be percent encoded since it is
-  used as a divider.
+- SFTP: make pwd output result to header callback
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3090268
-
-- curl_easy_setopt.3: spellfix
+  Sending "pwd" as a QUOTE command only sent the reply to the
+  DEBUGFUNCTION. Now it also sends an FTP-like header to the header
+  callback to allow similar operations as with FTP, and apps can re-use
+  the same parser.
 
-- curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_USE_SSL is not just for FTP
+- pubkey_show: allocate buffer to fit any-size result
   
-  It is for FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP at least.

-- SFTP: more ignoring negative file sizes
-  
-  As the change in 5f0ae7a0626cbe709 added a precaution against negative

-  introduces the same check at the second place in the code where the file
-  size from the libssh2 stat call is used.
+- ossl_seed: no more RAND_screen
   
-  This check might not be suitable for a 32 bit curl_off_t, but libssh2.h
-  assumes long long to work and to be 64 bit so I believe such a small
-  curl_off_t will be very unlikely to occur in the wild.
+  RAND_screen() is slow, not thread-safe and not needed anymore since OpenSSL
+  uses the thread-safe win32 CryptoAPI nowadays.

-- libcurl.m4: mention argument is PREFIX
-  
-  The macro provides a --with-libcurl option that expects a PREFIX to be
-  specified and not actually a "directory" in which libcurl will be found.

-- Some NetWare makefile tweaks.
-  
-  Renamed SDK_* to NDK_*; made NDK_* defines overwriteable from
-  environment; removed now obsolete YACC macro;
-  moved some curl_config.h defines to IPv6 section since they
-  are only needed when IPv6 is enabled - this makes libcurl compile
-  with older NDKs too which were not IPv6-aware.

-- krb5-gssapi: Removed a memory leak in krb5_auth.
-  
-  We forgot to release the buffer passed to gss_init_sec_context.
-  
-  The previous logic was difficult to read as we were reusing the same
-  variable (gssbuf) for both input buffer and output buffer. Splitted the
-  logic in 2 variables to better underline who needs to be released.
-  Also made the code break at 80 lines.
+Patrick Monnerat (21 Dec 2010)
+- New curl/curl.h definitions added to ILE/RPG binding.
 
-- krb5-gssapi: Made the function always return a value.
+Yang Tse (21 Dec 2010)
+- build: sort configuration hunks in lib/Makefile.vc6
   
-  kr5_auth missed a final 'return' statement. This is not an error in
-  gcc but can lead to potential bugs.
+  sorted to reflect same internal order as the one shown
+  in the usage message.
 
-- krb5-gssapi: Delete the GSS-API context.
-  
-  This fixes a memory leak related to the GSS-API code.
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Dec 2010)

-- HTTP: remove special case for 416
+- loadhostpairs: return errorcode
   
-  It was pointed out that the special case libcurl did for 416 was
-  incorrect and wrong. 416 is not really different to other errors so the
-  response body must be handled like for other errors/http responses.
+  Make sure that Curl_cache_addr() errors are propagated to callers of

-  
-  It is still not clarified exactly why this happens, but libssh2

-  multi & hiper examples: updates and cleanups
-  
-  all multi and hiper examples:
+  ares: ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   
-  * don't loop curl_multi_perform calls, that was <7.20.0 style, currently
-    the exported multi functions will not return CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
+  Make the c-ares resolver code ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses when
+  IPv6 is enabled.
   
-  all hiper examples:
-  * renamed check_run_count to check_multi_info
-  * don't  compare current running handle count with previous value, this
-    was the wrong way to check for finished requests, simply call
-    curl_multi_info_read
-  * it's also safe to call curl_multi_remove_handle inside the
-    curl_multi_info_read loop.
+  This is a workaround for the missing ares_getaddrinfo() and is a lot
+  easier to implement.
   
-  ghiper.c:
-  * replaced curl_multi_socket (that function is marked as obsolete) calls
-    with curl_multi_socket_action calls (as in hiperfifo.c and
-    evhiperfifo.c)
+  Note that as long as c-ares returns IPv4 addresses when IPv6 addresses
+  were requested but missing, this will cause a host's IPv4 addresses to
+  occur twice in the DNS cache.
   
-  ghiper.c and evhiperfifo.c:
-  * be smart as hiperfifo.c, don't do uncessary curl_multi_* calls in
-    new_conn and main

-- krb5-gssapi: Remove several memory leaks.
-  
-  Remove a leak seen on Kerberos/MIT (gss_OID is copied internally and
-  we were leaking it). Now we just pass NULL as advised in RFC2744.
-  
-  |tmp| was never set back to buf->data.
-  
-  Cleaned up Curl_sec_end to take into account failure in Curl_sec_login
-  (where conn->mech would be NULL but not conn->app_data or
-  conn->in_buffer->data).
+- [Brad Hards brought this change]
 
-- security.c: Remove Curl_sec_fflush_fd.
-  
-  The current implementation would make us send wrong data on a closed
-  socket. We don't buffer our data so the method can be safely removed.
+  smtp-tls: add Message-ID: header
 
-- security.c: We should always register the socket handler.
-  
-  Following a change in the way socket handler are registered, the custom
-  recv and send method were conditionaly registered.
-  We need to register them everytime to handle the ftp security
-  extensions.
-  
-  Re-added the clear text handling in sec_recv.
+- gitignore: ignore the new example execs
 
-- security.c: Fix Curl_sec_login after rewrite.
-  
-  Curl_sec_login was returning the opposite result that the code in ftp.c
-  was expecting. Simplified the return code (using a CURLcode) so to see
-  more clearly what is going on.
+- examples: fix compiler warnings
 
-- security.c: Readd the '\n' to the infof() calls.
-  
-  They are not automatically added and make the output of the verbose
-  mode a lot more readable.

-- multi: don't expire timeouts at disonnect or done
+  Docs: add simple SMTP example
   
-  The functions Curl_disconnect() and Curl_done() are both used within the
-  scope of a single request so they cannot be allowed to use
-  Curl_expire(... 0) to kill all timeouts as there are some timeouts that
-  are set before a request that are supposed to remain until the request
-  is done.
+  Add a simple SMTP example program, patterned after some of the existing
+  examples, and the curl application.
   
-  The timeouts are now instead cleared at curl_easy_cleanup() and when the
-  multi state machine changes a handle to the complete state.
+  This version addresses issues raised by David Woodhouse on comments in
+  the simplesmtp.c example.

+- axtls_connect: allow connect without peer verification
   
-  Just made sure that the good old curl indentation style is used all over
-  this file.
+  The SSL_SERVER_VERIFY_LATER bit in the ssl_ctx_new() call allows the
+  code to verify the peer certificate explicitly after the handshake and
+  then the "data->set.ssl.verifypeer" option works.
 
-- [Tim Newsome brought this change]
+- axTLS: allow "default" SSL version as well
+  
+  When no explicit version is selected we should try to use whatever is

-  TFTP: Work around tftpd-hpa upload bug
+- axtls.c: cleanup
   
-  tftpd-hpa has a bug where it will send an incorrect ack when the block
-  counter wraps and tftp options have been sent. Work around that by
-  accepting an ack for 65535 when we're expecting one for 0.
+  Removed trailing whitespace
+  Removed several compiler warnings
+  Removed odd backslashes at some line endings
 
-- Revert "security.c: buffer_read various fixes."
+- urldate: undef hideous memory defines
   
-  This reverts commit fbb38de415b7bb7d743e53a7b4b887ffb12b3e5b.
+  The public axTLS header (at least as of 1.2.7) redefines the memory
+  functions. We #undef those again immediately after the public header to
+  limit the damage. This should be fixed in axTLS.
 
-- security.c: removed superfluous parentheses
+- configure: make --with-axtls set prefix
   
-  And also removed the FIXME where memory was zeroed just before freed,
-  and some other minor whitespace changes.
+  In tradition with other options, have this point to the directory prefix
+  and not the lib directory. Otherwise we can't set the include path
+  reliably.

-The string given to CURLOPT_URL must be url-encoded and follow RFC 2396
+For a greater explanation of the format please see RFC 2396
 (http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/rfc2396.txt).
 
-Starting with version 7.20.0, the fragment part of the URI will not be send as
-part of the path, which was the case previously.
+If the given URL lacks the scheme, or protocol, part ("http://" or "ftp://"
+etc), libcurl will attempt to resolve which protocol to use based on the
+given host mame. If the protocol is not supported, libcurl will return
+(\fICURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL\fP) when you call \fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP
+or \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP. Use \fIcurl_version_info(3)\fP for detailed
+information on which protocols are supported.
+
+The host part of the URL contains the address of the server that you want to
+connect to. This can be the fully qualified domain name of the server, the
+local network name of the machine on your network or the IP address of the
+server or machine represented by either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. For example:
+
+http://www.example.com/
+
+http://hostname/
+
+http://192.168.0.1/
+
+http://[2001:1890:1112:1::20]/
+
+It is also possible to specify the user name and password as part of the
+host, for some protocols, when connecting to servers that require
+authentication.
+
+For example the following types of authentication support this:
+
+http://user:password@www.domain.com
+ftp://user:password@ftp.domain.com
+pop3://user:password@mail.domain.com
+
+The port is optional and when not specified libcurl will use the default port
+based on the determined or specified protocol: 80 for http, 21 for ftp and 25
+for smtp, etc. The following examples show how to specify the port:
+
+http://www.weirdserver.com:8080/ - This will connect to a web server using
+port 8080.
+
+smtp://mail.domain.com:587/ - This will connect to a smtp server on the
+alternative mail port.
+
+The path part of the URL is protocol specific and whilst some examples are
+given below this list is not conclusive:
+
+.B HTTP
+
+The path part of a HTTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what
+directory. If the directory is not specified then the web server's root
+directory is used. If the file is omitted then the default document will be
+retrieved for either the directory specified or the root directory. The
+exact resource returned for each URL is entirely dependent on the server's
+configuration.
+
+http://www.netscape.com - This gets the main page (index.html in this
+example) from Netscape's web server.
+
+http://www.netscape.com/index.html - This returns the main page from Netscape
+by specifying the page to get.
+
+http://www.netscape.com/contactus/ - This returns the default document from
+the contactus directory.
+
+.B FTP
+
+The path part of an FTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what
+directory. If the file part is omitted then libcurl downloads the directory
+listing for the directory specified. If the directory is omitted then
+the directory listing for the root / home directory will be returned.
+
+ftp://cool.haxx.se - This retrieves the directory listing for our FTP server.
+
+ftp://cool.haxx.se/readme.txt - This downloads the file readme.txt from the
+root directory.
+
+ftp://cool.haxx.se/libcurl/readme.txt - This downloads readme.txt from the
+libcurl directory.
+
+ftp://user:password@my.example.com/readme.txt - This retrieves the readme.txt
+file from the user's home directory. When a username and password is
+specified, everything that is specified in the path part is relative to the
+user's home directory. To retrieve files from the root directory or a
+directory underneath the root directory then the absolute path must be
+specified by prepending an additional forward slash to the beginning of the
+path.
+
+ftp://user:password@my.example.com//readme.txt - This retrieves the readme.txt
+from the root directory when logging in as a specified user.
+
+.B SMTP
+
+The path part of a SMTP request specifies the host name to present during
+communication with the mail server. If the path is omitted then libcurl will
+attempt to resolve the local computer's host name. However, this may not
+return the fully qualified domain name that is required by some mail servers
+and specifying this path allows you to set an alternative name, such as
+your machine's fully qualified domain name, which you might have obtained
+from an external function such as gethostname or getaddrinfo.
+
+smtp://mail.domain.com - This connects to the mail server at domain.com and
+sends your local computer's host name in the HELO / EHLO command.
+
+smtp://mail.domain.com/client.domain.com - This will send client.domain.com in
+the HELO / EHLO command to the mail server at domain.com.
+
+.B POP3
+
+The path part of a POP3 request specifies the mailbox (message) to retrieve.
+If the mailbox is not specified then a list of waiting messages is returned
+instead.
+
+pop3://user:password@mail.domain.com - This lists the available messages
+pop3://user:password@mail.domain.com/1 - This retrieves the first message
+
+.B SCP
+
+The path part of an SCP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what
+directory. The file part may not be omitted. The file is taken as an absolute
+path from the root directory on the server. To specify a path relative to
+the user's home directory on the server, prepend ~/ to the path portion.
+If the user name is not embedded in the URL, it can be set with the
+\fICURLOPT_USERPWD\fP or \fBCURLOPT_USERNAME\fP option.
+
+scp://user@example.com/etc/issue - This specifies the file /etc/issue
+
+scp://example.com/~/my-file - This specifies the file my-file in the
+user's home directory on the server
+
+.B SFTP
+
+The path part of an SFTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what
+directory. If the file part is omitted then libcurl downloads the directory
+listing for the directory specified.  If the path ends in a / then a directory
+listing is returned instead of a file.  If the path is omitted entirely then
+the directory listing for the root / home directory will be returned.
+If the user name is not embedded in the URL, it can be set with the
+\fICURLOPT_USERPWD\fP or \fBCURLOPT_USERNAME\fP option.
+
+sftp://user:password@example.com/etc/issue - This specifies the file
+/etc/issue
+
+sftp://user@example.com/~/my-file - This specifies the file my-file in the
+user's home directory

+sftp://ssh.example.com/~/Documents/ - This requests a directory listing
+of the Documents directory under the user's home directory

This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received header data. The header callback will be called once for each header and only complete header lines are passed on to the callback. Parsing headers is very easy using this. The size of the data pointed to by <span Class="emphasis">ptr</span> is <span Class="emphasis">size</span> multiplied with <span Class="emphasis">nmemb</span>. Do not assume that the header line is zero terminated! The pointer named <span Class="emphasis">userdata</span> is the one you set with the <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTWRITEHEADER">CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER</a> option. The callback function must return the number of bytes actually taken care of. If that amount differs from the amount passed to your function, it'll signal an error to the library. This will abort the transfer and return <span Class="emphasis">CURL_WRITE_ERROR</span>. 
+<p class="level1">A complete header that is passed to this function can be up to <span Class="emphasis">CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER</span> (100K) bytes.

That is, it will be the function specified with <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTWRITEFUNCTION">CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</a>, or if it is not specified or NULL - the default, stream-writing function. 
 <p class="level1">It's important to note that the callback will be invoked for the headers of all responses received after initiating a request and not just the final response. This includes all responses which occur during authentication negotiation. If you need to operate on only the headers from the final response, you will need to collect headers in the callback yourself and use HTTP status lines, for example, to delimit response boundaries. 
 <p class="level1">When a server sends a chunked encoded transfer, it may contain a trailer. That trailer is identical to a HTTP header and if such a trailer is received it is passed to the application using this callback as well. There are several ways to detect it being a trailer and not an ordinary header: 1) it comes after the response-body. 2) it comes after the final header line (CR LF) 3) a Trailer: header among the regular response-headers mention what header(s) to expect in the trailer.

 libcurl returns its fd_set sets. The application can use these to select() on,
 but be sure to FD_ZERO them before calling this function as
 \fIcurl_multi_fdset(3)\fP only adds its own descriptors, it doesn't zero or
 otherwise remove any others. The \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP function should be
 called as soon as one of them is ready to be read from or written to.

+The API is then designed to inform your application about which sockets

+Your application must then make sure to receive all sockets informed about in

+activity on them. When a socket has the given activity, you call
+\fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP specifying which socket and action there

+timeout expires, your application should call the
+\fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP function saying it was due to a timeout.

  curl_formadd() was made to fill in a public struct, but the fact that the
  struct is public is never really used by application for their own advantage
  but instead often restricts how the form functions can or can't be modified.
 
  Changing them to return a private handle will benefit the implementation and
  allow us much greater freedoms while still maintining a solid API and ABI.

+15.9 have form functions use CURL handle argument

+ curl_formadd() and curl_formget() both currently have no CURL handle
+ argument, but both can use a callback that is set in the easy handle, and
+ thus curl_formget() with callback cannot function without first having
+ curl_easy_perform() (or similar) called - which is hard to grasp and a design

 This release includes the following changes:
 
- o Added CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION
- o Added support for NTLM delegation to Samba's winbind daemon helper ntlm_auth
- o Display notes from setup file in testcurl.pl
- o BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack experimental support on Windows
- o OpenSSL: Use SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS if available
- o --delegation was added to set CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION
- o nss: start with no database if the selected database is broken
- o telnet: allow programatic use on Windows
+ o Empty headers can be sent in HTTP requests by terminating with a semicolon
+ o SSL session sharing support added to curl_share_setopt()
+ o Added support to MAIL FROM for the optional SIZE parameter
+ o smtp: Added support for NTLM authentication
+ o curl tool: code split into tool_*.[ch] files
 
 This release includes the following bugfixes:
 
- o curl_getdate: detect some illegal dates better
- o when sending a request and an error is received before the (entire) request
-   body is sent, stop sending the request and close the connection after
-   having received the entire response. This is equally true if an Expect:
-   100-continue header was used.
- o When using both -J and a single -O with multiple URLs, a missing init
-   could cause a segfault
- o -J fixed for escaped quotes
- o -J fixed for file names with semicolons
- o progress: reset flags at transfer start to avoid wrong 
-   CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD
- o curl_gssapi: Guard files with HAVE_GSSAPI and rename private header
- o silence picky compilers: mark unused parameters
- o help output: more gnu like output
- o libtests: stop checking for CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
- o setting a non-HTTP proxy with an environment variable or with CURLOPT_PROXY
-   / --proxy (without specifying CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE) would still make it do
-   proxy-like HTTP requests
- o CURLFORM_BUFFER: insert filename as documented (regression)
- o SOCKS: fix the connect timeout
- o ftp_doing: bail out on error properly while multi interfacing
- o improved Content-Encoded decoding error message
- o asyn-thread: check for dotted addresses before thread starts
- o cmake: find winsock when building on windows
- o Curl_retry_request: check return code
- o cookies: handle 'secure=' as if it was 'secure'
- o tests: break busy loops in tests 502, 555, and 573
- o FTP: fix proxy connect race condition with multi interface and SOCKS proxy
- o RTSP: GET_PARAMETER requests have a body
- o fixed several memory leaks in OOM situations
- o bad expire(0) caused multi_socket API to hang
- o Avoid ftruncate() static define with mingw64
- o mk-ca-bundle.pl: ignore untrusted certs
- o builds with PolarSSL 1.0.0
+ o handle HTTP redirects to "//hostname/path"
+ o SMTP without --mail-from caused segfault
+ o prevent extra progress meter headers between multiple files
+ o allow Content-Length to be replaced when sending HTTP requests
+ o curl now always sets postfieldsize to allow --data-binary and --data
+   to be mixed in the same command line
+ o curl_multi_fdset: avoid FD_SET out of bounds
+ o lots of MinGW build tweaks
+ o Curl_gethostname: return un-qualified machine name
+ o fixed the openssl version number configure check
+ o nss: certificates from files are no longer looked up by file base names
+ o returning abort from the progress function when using the multi interface
+   would not properly cancel the transfer and close the connection
+ o fix libcurl.m4 to not fail with modern gcc versions
+ o ftp: improved the failed PORT host name resolved error message
+ o TFTP timeout and unexpected block adjustments
+ o HTTP and GOPHER test server-side connection closing adjustments
+ o fix endless loop upon transport connection timeout
+ o don't clobber errno on failed connect
+ o typecheck: allow NULL to unset CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER
+ o formdata: ack read callback abort
+ o make --show-error properly position independent
+ o set the ipv6-connection boolean correctly on connect
+ o SMTP: fix end-of-body string escaping
+ o gtls: only call gnutls_transport_set_lowat with <gnutls-2.12.0
+ o HTTP: handle multiple auths in a single WWW-Authenticate line
+ o curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
+ o windbuild: fix the static build
+ o fix builds with GnuTLS version 3
+ o fix calling of OpenSSL's ERR_remove_state(0)
+ o HTTP auth: fix proxy Negotiate bug when Negotiate not requested
+ o ftp PORT: don't hang if bind() fails
+ o -# would crash on terminals wider than 256 columns
 
 This release includes the following known bugs:
 
  o see docs/KNOWN_BUGS (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/knownbugs.html)

+** Macros for test source code readability/maintainability.
+**
+** All of the following macros require that an int data type 'res' variable
+** exists in scope where macro is used, and that it has been initialized to
+** zero before the macro is used.
+**
+** exe_* and chk_* macros are helper macros not intended to be used from
+** outside of this header file. Arguments 'Y' and 'Z' of these represent
+** source code file and line number, while Arguments 'A', 'B', etc, are
+** the arguments used to actually call a libcurl function.
+**
+** All easy_* and multi_* macros call a libcurl function and evaluate if
+** the function has succeeded or failed. When the function succeeds 'res'
+** variable is not set nor cleared and program continues normal flow. On
+** the other hand if function fails 'res' variable is set and a jump to
+** label 'test_cleanup' is performed.
+**
+** Every easy_* and multi_* macros have a res_easy_* and res_multi_* macro
+** counterpart that operates in tha same way with the exception that no
+** jump takes place in case of failure. res_easy_* and res_multi_* macros
+** should be immediately followed by checking if 'res' variable has been
+** set.
+**
+** 'res' variable when set will hold a CURLcode, CURLMcode, or any of the
+** TEST_ERR_* values defined above. It is advisable to return this value
+** as test result.

-  servers on these ports to which it makes requests.  For SSL tests, it runs
-  stunnel to handle encryption to the regular servers. For SSH, it runs a
-  standard OpenSSH server. For SOCKS4/5 tests SSH is used to perform the SOCKS

+  the SOCKS functionality and requires a SSH client and server.
+
+  The base port number (8990), which all the individual port numbers are

+  running more than one instance of the test suite simultaneously on one

+  those ports.
+
+ 1.4 Run
 
-Run:
   'make test'. This builds the test suite support code and invokes the
   'runtests.pl' perl script to run all the tests. Edit the top variables
   of that script in case you have some specific needs, or run the script
   manually (after the support code has been built).
 
   The script breaks on the first test that doesn't do OK. Use -a to prevent
-  the script from abort on the first error. Run the script with -v for more

   verbose output. Use -d to run the test servers with debug output enabled as
   well. Specifying -k keeps all the log files generated by the test intact.
 
   Use -s for shorter output, or pass test numbers to run specific tests only
   (like "./runtests.pl 3 4" to test 3 and 4 only). It also supports test case
   ranges with 'to', as in "./runtests 3 to 9" which runs the seven tests from
   3 to 9. Any test numbers starting with ! are disabled, as are any test
   numbers found in the file data/DISABLED (one per line).
 
-Shell startup scripts:
+ 1.5 Shell startup scripts
+
   Tests which use the ssh test server, SCP/SFTP/SOCKS tests, might be badly
   influenced by the output of system wide or user specific shell startup
   scripts, .bashrc, .profile, /etc/csh.cshrc, .login, /etc/bashrc, etc. which
   output text messages or escape sequences on user login.  When these shell
   startup messages or escape sequences are output they might corrupt the

-Memory:
+ 1.6 Memory test
+
   The test script will check that all allocated memory is freed properly IF
   curl has been built with the CURLDEBUG define set. The script will
-  automatically detect if that is the case, and it will use the ../memanalyze

+
+ 1.7 Debug
 
-Debug:
   If a test case fails, you can conveniently get the script to invoke the
   debugger (gdb) for you with the server running and the exact same command
   line parameters that failed. Just invoke 'runtests.pl <test number> -g' and
   then just type 'run' in the debugger to perform the command through the
   debugger.
 
-  If a test case causes a core dump, analyze it by running gdb like:
-
-          # gdb ../curl/src core
+ 1.8 Logs
 
-  ... and get a stack trace with the gdb command:
+  All logs are generated in the logs/ subdirectory (it is emptied first in the
+  runtests.pl script). Use runtests.pl -k to force it to keep the temporary
+  files after the test run since successful runs will clean it up otherwise.

-Data:
   All test cases are put in the data/ subdirectory. Each test is stored in the
   file named according to the test number.
 
   See FILEFORMAT for the description of the test case files.
 
-Code coverage:
+ 1.10 Code coverage
+
   gcc provides a tool that can determine the code coverage figures for
   the test suite.  To use it, configure curl with
   CFLAGS='-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -g -O0'.  Make sure you run the normal

-Remote testing:
+ 1.11 Remote testing
+
   The runtests.pl script provides some hooks to allow curl to be tested on a
   machine where perl can not be run.  The test framework in this case runs on
   a workstation where perl is available, while curl itself is run on a remote
   system using ssh or some other remote execution method.  See the comments at
   the beginning of runtests.pl for details.

+  own server requirements, independent of test number.
+
+3. Write tests
+
+  Here's a quick description on writing test cases. We basically have three
+  kinds of tests: the ones that test the curl tool, the ones that build small
+  applications and test libcurl directly and the unit tests that test
+  individual (possibly internal) functions.
+
+ 3.1 test data
+
+  Each test has a master file that controls all the test data. What to read,
+  what the protocol exchange should look like, what exit code to expect and
+  what command line arguments to use etc.
+
+  These files are tests/data/test[num] where [num] is described in section 2
+  of this document, and the XML-like file format of them is described in the
+  separate tests/FILEFORMAT document.
+
+ 3.2 curl tests
+
+  A test case that runs the curl tool and verifies that it gets the correct
+  data, it sends the correct data, it uses the correct protocol primitives
+  etc.
+
+ 3.3 libcurl tests
+
+  The libcurl tests are identical to the curl ones, except that they use a
+  specific and dedicated custom-built program to run instead of "curl". This
+  tool is built from source code placed in tests/libtest and if you want to
+  make a new libcurl test that is where you add your code.
+
+ 3.4 unit tests
+
+  Unit tests are tests in the 13xx sequence and they are placed in tests/unit.
+  There's a tests/unit/README describing the specific set of checks and macros
+  that may be used when writing tests that verify behaviors of specific
+  individual functions.
+
+  The unit tests depend on curl being built with debug enabled.
