-  travis: fix OSX build by re-installing libtool
+  speed caps: not based on average speeds anymore
   
-  Apparently due to a broken homebrew install
+  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
+  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
+  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
+  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
+  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
+  bursts" (as told in man page).
   
-  fixes #934
-  Closes #939
+  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
+  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
+  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
+  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
+  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
+  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
+  
+  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
+  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
+  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
+  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
+  case of sudden speed burst).
+  
+  Closes #971

+  ftp: fix wrong poll on the secondary socket
+  
+  When we're uploading using FTP and the server issues a tiny pause
+  between opening the connection to the client's secondary socket, the

+
+  curl: allow "pkcs11:" prefix for client certificates
   
-  Explain how some FTP servers support the machine readable listing
-  format MLSD from RFC 3659 and compare it to LIST.
+  RFC7512 provides a standard method to reference certificates in PKCS#11
+  tokens, by means of a URI starting 'pkcs11:'.
   
-  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/906
+  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
+  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
+  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
+  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.
+  
+  This doesn't work with cURL because of the way that the colon is used
+  to separate the certificate argument from the passphrase. So instead of
+  
+     curl -E 'pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  
+  I instead need to invoke cURL with the colon escaped, like this:
+  
+     curl -E 'pkcs11\:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  
+  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
+  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
+  differences for different applications.
+  
+  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
+  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
+  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
+  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
+  the URI itself.
+  
+  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
+  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
+  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
+  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
+  
+  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
+  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
+  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
+  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

-  vtls: fix ssl session cache race condition
+- KNOWN_BUGS: SOCKS proxy not working via IPv6
   
-  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
-  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
-  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
-  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
-  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
-  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
-  This commit:
-   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
-     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
-   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
-     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
-   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
-     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
-     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
-     this race.

+  If a call to GetSystemDirectory fails, the `path` pointer that was

-- URL parser: allow URLs to use one, two or three slashes
+- include: revert 9adf3c4 and make public types void * again
   
-  Mostly in order to support broken web sites that redirect to broken URLs
-  that are accepted by browsers.
+  Many applications assume the actual contents of the public types and use
+  that do for example forward declarations (saving them from including our
+  public header) which then breaks when we switch from void * to a struct
+  *.
   
-  Browsers are typically even more leniant than this as the WHATWG URL
-  spec they should allow an _infinite_ amount. I tested 8000 slashes with
-  Firefox and it just worked.
+  I'm not convinced we were wrong, but since this practise seems
+  widespread enough I'm willing to (partly) step down.
   
-  Added test case 1141, 1142 and 1143 to verify the new parser.
+  Now libcurl uses the struct itself when it is built and it allows
+  applications to use the struct type if CURL_STRICTER is defined at the
+  time of the #include.

-  margin in the buffer.
+  Prior to this change we called Curl_ssl_getsessionid and
+  Curl_ssl_addsessionid regardless of whether session ID reusing was
+  enabled. According to comments that is in case session ID reuse was
+  disabled but then later enabled.
   
-  Also, removed the extra brace level indentation in the code and made it
-  so that 'workend' is only assigned once within the function.
+  The old way was not intuitive and probably not something users expected.
+  When a user disables session ID caching I'd guess they don't expect the
+  session ID to be cached anyway in case the caching is later enabled.

-  The previous place of init/cleanup code made the internal pointer to be NULL
-  when this feature was used with the multi_socket() API, as it was made within
-  the curl_multi_perform() function.
+  Some builds of GCC produce output on both stdout and stderr when --help
+  --verbose is used.  The 2>&1 redirection caused them to be arbitrarily
+  interleaved with each other because of stream buffering.  Consequently,
+  grep failed to match the fvisibility= string in the mixed output, even

+  The HTTP/2 tests brought with commit bf05606ef1f were using the internal

-  http2: Add space between colon and header value
-  
-  curl's representation of HTTP/2 responses involves transforming the
-  response to a format that is similar to HTTP/1.1. Prior to this change,
-  curl would do this by separating header names and values with only a
-  colon, without introducing a space after the colon.
-  
-  While this is technically a valid way to represent a HTTP/1.1 header
-  block, it is much more common to see a space following the colon. This
-  change introduces that space, to ensure that incautious tools are safely
-  able to parse the header block.
-  
-  This also ensures that the difference between the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
-  response layout is as minimal as possible.

-  TLS: SSL_peek is not a const operation
-  
-  Calling SSL_peek can cause bytes to be read from the raw socket which in
-  turn can upset the select machinery that determines whether there's data
-  available on the socket.
+Steve Holme (6 Jun 2016)
+- schannel: Disable ALPN on Windows < 8.1
   
-  Since Curl_ossl_check_cxn only tries to determine whether the socket is
-  alive and doesn't actually need to see the bytes SSL_peek seems like
-  the wrong function to call.
+  Calling QueryContextAttributes with SECPKG_ATTR_APPLICATION_PROTOCOL
+  fails on Windows < 8.1 so we need to disable ALPN on these OS versions.
   
-  We're able to occasionally reproduce a connect timeout due to this
-  bug. What happens is that Curl doesn't know to call SSL_connect again
-  after the peek happens since data is buffered in the SSL buffer and thus
-  select won't fire for this socket.

-  Reported-by: rcanavan
-  Assisted-by: Isaac Boukris
-  Closes #785
+  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
+  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
+  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
+  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
+  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
+  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
+  This commit:
+   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
+     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
+   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
+     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
+   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
+     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
+     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
+     this race.

-  sendf.c: added ability to call recv() before send() as workaround
+  http2: Add space between colon and header value
   
-  WinSock destroys recv() buffer if send() is failed. As result - server
-  response may be lost if server sent it while curl is still sending
-  request. This behavior noticeable on HTTP server short replies if
-  libcurl use several send() for request (usually for POST request).
-  To workaround this problem, libcurl use recv() before every send() and
-  keeps received data in intermediate buffer for further processing.
+  curl's representation of HTTP/2 responses involves transforming the
+  response to a format that is similar to HTTP/1.1. Prior to this change,
+  curl would do this by separating header names and values with only a
+  colon, without introducing a space after the colon.

-  http2: Add handling stream level error
+  None of them include system headers, they all do funny #defines.
   
-  Previously, when a stream was closed with other than NGHTTP2_NO_ERROR
-  by RST_STREAM, underlying TCP connection was dropped.  This is
-  undesirable since there may be other streams multiplexed and they are
-  very much fine.  This change introduce new error code
-  CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM, which indicates stream error that only affects the
-  relevant stream, and connection should be kept open.  The existing
-  CURLE_HTTP2 means connection error in general.

-- CURLOPT_SOCKS5_GSSAPI_SERVICE: Merged with CURLOPT_PROXY_SERVICE_NAME
+  It does open up a miniscule risk that one of the other protocols that
+  libcurl could use would send back a Content-Disposition header and then
+  curl would act on it even if not HTTP.
   
-  As these two options provide identical functionality, the former for
-  SOCK5 proxies and the latter for HTTP proxies, merged the two options
-  together.
+  A future mitigation for this risk would be to allow the callback to ask
+  libcurl which protocol is being used.

-- curl/mprintf.h: remove support for _MPRINTF_REPLACE
+- http2: Improve header parsing
   
-  The define is not in our name space and is therefore not protected by

+  - Error if a header line is larger than supported.
   
-  It was only really used by libcurl internals but was mostly erased from
-  there already in 8aabbf5 (March 2015). This is supposedly the final
-  death blow to that define from everywhere.
+  - Warn if cumulative header line length may be larger than supported.
   
-  As a side-effect, making sure _MPRINTF_REPLACE is gone and not used, I
-  made the lib tests in tests/libtest/ use curl_printf.h for its redefine
-  magic and then subsequently the use of sprintf() got banned in the tests
-  as well (as it is in libcurl internals) and I then replaced them all
-  with snprintf().
+  - Allow spaces when parsing the path component.
   
-  In the unlikely event that any users is actually using this define and
-  gets sad by this change, it is very easily copied to the user's own
-  code.

-  The list and search response functions were identical! Merged into one
-  now. Detected by PVS Studio.
+  This commit ensures that streams which was closed in on_stream_close
+  callback gets passed to http2_handle_stream_close.  Previously, this
+  might not happen.  To achieve this, we increment drain property to
+  forcibly call recv function for that stream.
   
-  Reported-by: Alexis La Goutte
-
-- SOCKS5_gssapi_negotiate: don't assume little-endian ints
+  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
+  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into
+  http_conn.drain_total.  We only shutdown session if that value is 0.
   
-  The code copied one byte from a 32bit integer, which works fine as long
-  as the byte order is the same. Not a fine assumption. Reported by PVS
-  Studio.
+  With this commit, when stream was closed before reading response
+  header fields, error code CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM is returned even if
+  HTTP/2 level error is NO_ERROR.  This signals the upper layer that
+  stream was closed by error just like TCP connection close in HTTP/1.

+- KNOWN_BUGS: remove 68, 70 and 72.
+  
+  Due to their age (we don't fully know if they actually remain) and lack
+  of detail - very few people will bother to find out what they're about
+  or work on them. If people truly still suffer from any of these, I
+  assume they will be reported again and then we'll deal with them.

+- http2: fix connection reuse when PING comes after last DATA
+  
+  It turns out the google GFE HTTP/2 servers send a PING frame immediately
+  after a stream ends and its last DATA has been received by curl. So if
+  we don't drain that from the socket, it makes the socket readable in
+  subsequent checks and libcurl then (wrongly) assumes the connection is
+  dead when trying to reuse the connection.

-- build-wolfssl: Update VS properties for wolfSSL v3.9.0
-  
-  - Do not use wolfSSL's sample user-setting files.
-  
-  wolfSSL starting in v3.9.0 has added their own sample user settings that
-  are applied by default, but we don't use them because we have our own
-  settings.
-  
-  - Do not use wolfSSL's Visual Studio Unicode character setting.
+- checksrc.bat: Added support for the tests directory
+
+- vauth: Removed the need for a separate GSS-API based SPN function
+
+- curl_sasl: Fixed potential null pointer utilisation
   
-  wolfSSL Visual Studio projects use the Unicode character set however our
-  settings and options imitate mingw build which does not use the Unicode
-  character set. This does not appear to have any effect at the moment but
-  better safe than sorry.
+  Although this should never happen due to the relationship between the
+  'mech' and 'resp' variables, and the way they are allocated together,
+  it does cause problems for code analysis tools:
   
+  V595 The 'mech' pointer was utilized before it was verified against
+       nullptr. Check lines: 376, 381. curl_sasl.c 376

+  the credentials were NULL rather than when the challenge message was

-  Additionally, corrected some example code to adhere to the recommended

-Steve Holme (19 Mar 2016)
-- build: Added missing Visual Studio filter files for VC10 onwards
+- krb5: Only generate a SPN when its not known
   
-  As these files don't need to contain references to the source files,
-  although typically do, added basic files which only include three
-  filters and don't require the project file generator to be modified.
+  Prior to this change, we were generating the SPN in the SSPI code when
+  the credentials were NULL and in the GSS-API code when the context was
+  empty. It is better to decouple the SPN generation from these checks
+  and only generate it when the SPN itself is NULL.
   
-  These files allow the source code to be viewed in the Solution Explorer
-  in versions of Visual Studio from 2010 onwards in the same manner as
-  previous versions did rather than one large view of files.
+  This also brings this part of the Kerberos 5 code in line with the
+  Negotiate code.

+- http2: make use of the nghttp2 error callback
   
-  Introduced in commit ca5f9341ef this happens because a char*, which is
-  32-bits wide in 32-bit land, is being cast to a curl_off_t which is
-  64-bits wide where 64-bit integers are supported by the compiler.
+  It offers extra info from nghttp2 in certain error cases. Like for
+  example when trying prior-knowledge http2 on a server that doesn't speak
+  http2 at all. The error message is passed on as a verbose message to
+  libcurl.
   
-  This doesn't happen in 64-bit land as a pointer is the same size as a
-  curl_off_t.
+  Discussed in #722
   
-  This fix doesn't address the fact that a 64-bit value cannot be used
-  for CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN when set in a form array and compiled on a
-  32-bit platforms, it does at least suppress the compilation warning.

-- cookies: first n/v pair in Set-Cookie: is the cookie, then parameters
+Jay Satiro (29 Mar 2016)
+- wolfssl: Use ECC supported curves extension
   
-  RFC 6265 section 4.1.1 spells out that the first name/value pair in the
-  header is the actual cookie name and content, while the following are
-  the parameters.
+  https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/issues/366
+
+- build-wolfssl: Allow a broader range of ciphers (Visual Studio)
   
-  libcurl previously had a more liberal approach which causes significant
-  problems when introducing new cookie parameters, like the suggested new
-  cookie priority draft.
+  This is an update to the build-time options used to build wolfSSL in
+  Visual Studio for greater compatibility, and make it behave similar to
+  the way OpenSSL 1.0.2 behaves. Starting in wolfSSL v3.6.6 static ciphers
+  and SSLv3 are disabled by default at build time, but we can use both.
   
-  The previous logic read all n/v pairs from left-to-right and the first
-  name used that wassn't a known parameter name would be used as the
-  cookie name, thus accepting "Set-Cookie: Max-Age=2; person=daniel" to be
-  a cookie named 'person' while an RFC 6265 compliant parser should
-  consider that to be a cookie named 'Max-Age' with an (unknown) parameter
-  'person'.
+  - Enable static cipher suites TLS_ECDH_ and TLS_RSA_.
   
-  Fixes #709
+  - Enable SSLv3 hello. Though in libcurl we disable it by default at
+  runtime, we make it available so the user can manually select it if
+  necessary.

+  In addition, the old code was printing a colon twice after the prefix

-  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/234
-  Reported-by: dkjjr89@users.noreply.github.com

-  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2015-09/0127.html
-  Reported-by: Michael König
+  This fix doesn't address the fact that a 64-bit value cannot be used
+  for CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN when set in a form array and compiled on a
+  32-bit platforms, it does at least suppress the compilation warning.

-- mbedtls: Fix pinned key return value on fail
-  
-  - Switch from verifying a pinned public key in a callback during the
-  certificate verification to inline after the certificate verification.
-  
-  The callback method had three problems:
-  
-  1. If a pinned public key didn't match, CURLE_SSL_PINNEDPUBKEYNOTMATCH
-  was not returned.
-  
-  2. If peer certificate verification was disabled the pinned key
-  verification did not take place as it should.
-  
-  3. (related to #2) If there was no certificate of depth 0 the callback
-  would not have checked the pinned public key.
+  http: Don't break the header into chunks if HTTP/2
   
-  Though all those problems could have been fixed it would have made the
-  code more complex. Instead we now verify inline after the certificate
-  verification in mbedtls_connect_step2.
+  nghttp2 callback deals with TLS layer and therefore the header does not
+  need to be broken into chunks.

+  As of https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/#/c/6980/, almost all of
+  BoringSSL #ifdefs in cURL should be unnecessary:
   
-  - Wrap nghttp2 code in ifdef USE_NGHTTP2.
+  - BoringSSL provides no-op stubs for compatibility which replaces most
+    #ifdefs.

-  Mistake from commit a464f33843ee1

-  http2: Support trailer fields
+  - New flags to modify sanitize behavior:
   
-  This commit adds trailer support in HTTP/2.  In HTTP/1.1, chunked
-  encoding must be used to send trialer fields.  HTTP/2 deprecated any
-  trandfer-encoding, including chunked.  But trailer fields are now
-  always available.
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_COLONS: Allow colons
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_PATH: Allow path separators and colons
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_RESERVED: Allow reserved device names
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_TRUNCATE: Allow truncating a long filename
   
-  Since trailer fields are relatively rare these days (gRPC uses them
-  extensively though), allocating buffer for trailer fields is done when
-  we detect that HEADERS frame containing trailer fields is started.  We
-  use Curl_add_buffer_* functions to buffer all trailers, just like we
-  do for regular header fields.  And then deliver them when stream is
-  closed.  We have to be careful here so that all data are delivered to
-  upper layer before sending trailers to the application.
+  - Restore sanitization of banned characters from user-specified outfile.
   
-  We can deliver trailer field one by one using NGHTTP2_ERR_PAUSE
-  mechanism, but current method is far more simple.
+  Prior to this commit sanitization of a user-specified outfile was
+  temporarily disabled in 2b6dadc because there was no way to allow path
+  separators and colons through while replacing other banned characters.
+  Now in such a case we call the sanitize function with
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_PATH which allows path separators and colons to pass
+  through.
   
-  Another possibility is use chunked encoding internally for HTTP/2
-  traffic.  I have not tested it, but it could add another overhead.

+  Proxy NTLM authentication should compare credentials when
+  re-using a connection similar to host authentication, as it

-  - In curl_addrinfo.c lwIP's getaddrinfo() + freeaddrinfo() macros need
-  special handling because they were undef'ed in memdebug.h.
+  Example:
+  curl -v -x http://proxy:port http://host/ -U good_user:good_pwd

-  - set the correct stream_id for pushed streams
-  - init maxdownload and size properly
-
-- http2 push: set weight for new stream
+  The callback method had three problems:
   
-  give the new stream the old one's stream_weight internally to avoid

+  2. If peer certificate verification was disabled the pinned key
+  verification did not take place as it should.
+  
+  3. (related to #2) If there was no certificate of depth 0 the callback
+  would not have checked the pinned public key.
   
-  IoctlSocket() apparently wants a pointer to a long, passed as a char *
-  in its third parameter. This bug was introduced already back in commit
-  c5fdeef41d from October 1 2001!
+  Though all those problems could have been fixed it would have made the

+  verification in mbedtls_connect_step2.

-  Commit f3bae6ed73 added the URL index to the password prompt when using
-  --next. Unfortunately, because the size_t specifier (%zu) is not
-  supported by all sprintf() implementations we use the curl_off_t format
-  specifier instead. The display of an incorrect value arises on platforms

+- ssh: make CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE treat "" as NULL
   
-  The RTSP code path didn't skip adding the if-modified-since for certain
-  RTSP code paths, even if CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION was set to
-  CURL_TIMECOND_NONE.
+  The CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE option has been documented to handle
+  empty strings specially since curl-7_25_0-31-g05a443a but the behavior
+  was unintentionally removed in curl-7_38_0-47-gfa7d04f.
   
-  Also, an unknown non-zero CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION value no longer equals
-  CURL_TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE.
+  This commit restores the original behavior and clarifies it in the
+  documentation that NULL and "" have both the same meaning when passed
+  to CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE.

+- configure: assume IPv6 works when cross-compiled
   
-  Still it avoids that final progress update if we reached DONE as the
-  result of a callback abort to avoid another callback to be called after
-  an abort-by-callback.
+  The configure test uses AC_TRY_RUN to figure out if an ipv6 socket
+  works, and testing like that doesn't work for cross-compiles. These days
+  IPv6 support is widespread so a blind guess is probably more likely to
+  be 'yes' than 'no' now.
   
-  Reported-by: Lukas Ruzicka
+  Further: anyone who cross-compiles can use configure's --disable-ipv6 to
+  explicitly disable IPv6 and that also works for cross-compiles.

-- tests: Disabled 889 and 890 until we support POP3 continuation responses
-  
-  As POP3 final and continuation responses both begin with a + character,
-  and both the finalcode and contcode variables in SASLprotoc are set as
-  such, we cannot tell the difference between them when we are expecting
-  an optional continuation from the server such as the following:
+  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
   
-  + something else from the server
-  +OK final response
+  Previously, when HTTP/2 is enabled and used, and stream has content
+  length known, Curl_read was not called when there was no bytes left to
+  read. Because of this, we could not make sure that
+  http2_handle_stream_close was called for every stream. Since we use
+  http2_handle_stream_close to emit trailer fields, they were
+  effectively ignored. This commit changes the code so that Curl_read is
+  called even if no bytes left to read, to ensure that
+  http2_handle_stream_close is called for every stream.
   
-  Disabled these tests until such a time we can tell the responses apart.

-  - no point in repeating curl features that is already listed as features
-    from the curl -V output
+  This allows the root Makefile.am to include the Makefile.inc without
+  causing automake to warn on it (variables named *_SOURCES are
+  magic). curl_SOURCES is then instead assigned properly in

+  This commit adds trailer support in HTTP/2.  In HTTP/1.1, chunked

-  imap: Don't check for continuation when executing a CUSTOMREQUEST
+  Since trailer fields are relatively rare these days (gRPC uses them
+  extensively though), allocating buffer for trailer fields is done when
+  we detect that HEADERS frame containing trailer fields is started.  We
+  use Curl_add_buffer_* functions to buffer all trailers, just like we
+  do for regular header fields.  And then deliver them when stream is
+  closed.  We have to be careful here so that all data are delivered to

+  The name of the header guard in lwIP's <lwip/opt.h> has changed from
+  '__LWIP_OPT_H__' to 'LWIP_HDR_OPT_H' (bug #35874 in May 2015).
   
-  Background:
+  Other fixes:
   
-  Last week in 14d5a86 a change was made to allow the user to set the
-  PKGCONFIG variable. Today in 72d99f2 I supplemented that to allow the
-  more common PKG_CONFIG as an alternative if PKGCONFIG is not set.
+  - In curl_setup.h, the problem with an old PSDK doesn't apply if lwIP is
+  used.
   
-  Neither of those changes worked as expected because PKGCONFIG is
-  occasionally reset in configure and by the CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG macro.
-  Instead in this commit I take the approach that the user may set
-  PKG_CONFIG only.
-
-- build: Fix mingw ssl gdi32 order

+  - In curl_addrinfo.c lwIP's getaddrinfo() + freeaddrinfo() macros need

-  - Allow PKG_CONFIG to set pkg-config location and options
+  - In select.c we can't use preprocessor conditionals inside select if
+  MSVC and select is a macro, as it is with lwIP.

 .TH CURLMOPT_PIPELINING 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_multi_setopt options"
 .SH NAME
-CURLMOPT_PIPELINING \- enable/disable HTTP pipelining
+CURLMOPT_PIPELINING \- enable HTTP pipelining and multiplexing
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
-CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING, long bits);
+CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING, long bitmask);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-Set the \fBbits\fP parameter to 1 to make libcurl use HTTP pipelining for
-HTTP/1.1 transfers done using this multi handle, as far as possible. This
-means that if you add a second request that can use an already existing
-connection, the second request will be \&"piped" on the same connection rather
-than being executed in parallel.
-
-When using pipelining, there are also several other related options that are
-interesting to tweak and adjust to alter how libcurl spreads out requests on
-different connections or not etc.
+Pass in the \fBbitmask\fP parameter to instruct libcurl to enable HTTP
+pipelining and/or HTTP/2 multiplexing for this multi handle.
 
-Starting in 7.43.0, the \fBbits\fP parameter's bit 1 also has a meaning and
-libcurl is now offering symbol names for the bits:
+When enabled, libcurl will attempt to use those protocol features when doing
+parallel requests to the same hosts.
+
+For pipelining, this means that if you add a second request that can use an
+already existing connection, the second request will be \&"piped" on the same
+connection rather than being executed in parallel.
+
+For multiplexing, this means that follow-up requests can re-use an existing
+connection and send the new request multiplexed over that at the same time as
+other transfers are already using that single connection.
+
+There are several other related options that are interesting to tweak and
+adjust to alter how libcurl spreads out requests on different connections or
+not etc.
+
+Before 7.43.0, this option was set to 1 and 0 to enable and disable HTTP/1.1
+pipelining.
+
+Starting in 7.43.0, \fBbitmask\fP's second bit also has a meaning, and you can
+ask for pipelining and multiplexing independently of each other by toggling
+the correct bits.
 .IP CURLPIPE_NOTHING (0)
 Default, which means doing no attempts at pipelining or multiplexing.
 .IP CURLPIPE_HTTP1 (1)
 If this bit is set, libcurl will try to pipeline HTTP/1.1 requests on
 connections that are already established and in use to hosts.
 .IP CURLPIPE_MULTIPLEX (2)
 If this bit is set, libcurl will try to multiplex the new transfer over an
 existing connection if possible. This requires HTTP/2.
 .SH DEFAULT
-0 (off)
+0 (both pipeline and multiplexing are off)
 .SH PROTOCOLS
 HTTP(S)
 .SH EXAMPLE
 TODO
 .SH AVAILABILITY
 Added in 7.16.0. Multiplex support bit added in 7.43.0.

 .SH NAME
 CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY \- set the TCP_NODELAY option
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY, long nodelay);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a long specifying whether the TCP_NODELAY option is to be set or cleared
-(1 = set, 0 = clear). The option is cleared by default. This will have no
-effect after the connection has been established.
+(1 = set, 0 = clear). The option is set by default. This will have no effect
+after the connection has been established.
 
 Setting this option will disable TCP's Nagle algorithm. The purpose of this
 algorithm is to try to minimize the number of small packets on the network
 (where "small packets" means TCP segments less than the Maximum Segment Size
 (MSS) for the network).
 
 Maximizing the amount of data sent per TCP segment is good because it
 amortizes the overhead of the send. However, in some cases small segments may
 need to be sent without delay. This is less efficient than sending larger
 amounts of data at a time, and can contribute to congestion on the network if
 overdone.

+13.9 Support TLS v1.3
+
+ TLS version 1.3 is about to ship and is getting implemented by TLS libraries
+ as we speak. We should start to support the symbol and make sure all backends
+ handle it accordingly, then gradually add support as the TLS libraries add
+ the corresponding support. There may be a need to add some additional options
+ to allow libcurl to take advantage of the new features in 1.3.

+17. SSH protocols
+
+17.1 Multiplexing
+
+ SSH is a perfectly fine multiplexed protocols which would allow libcurl to do
+ multiple parallel transfers from the same host using the same connection,
+ much in the same spirit as HTTP/2 does. libcurl however does not take
+ advantage of that ability but will instead always create a new connection for
+ new transfers even if an existing connection already exists to the host.
+
+ To fix this, libcurl would have to detect an existing connection and "attach"
+ the new transfer to the existing one.
+
+17.2 SFTP performance
+
+ libcurl's SFTP transfer performance is sub par and can be improved, mostly by
+ the approach mentioned in "1.6 Modified buffer size approach".

+18.3 prevent file overwriting
 
  Add an option that prevents cURL from overwriting existing local files. When
  used, and there already is an existing file with the target file name
  (either -O or -o), a number should be appended (and increased if already
  existing). So that index.html becomes first index.html.1 and then
  index.html.2 etc.
 
-17.4 simultaneous parallel transfers
+18.4 simultaneous parallel transfers
 
  The client could be told to use maximum N simultaneous parallel transfers and
  then just make sure that happens. It should of course not make more than one
  connection to the same remote host. This would require the client to use the
  multi interface. https://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1558595
 
  Using the multi interface would also allow properly using parallel transfers
  with HTTP/2 and supporting HTTP/2 server push from the command line.

  Provide an option that makes curl not exit after the last URL (or even work
  without a given URL), and then make it read instructions passed on a pipe or
  over a socket to make further instructions so that a second subsequent curl
  invoke can talk to the still running instance and ask for transfers to get
  done, and thus maintain its connection pool, DNS cache and more.
 
-17.13 support metalink in http headers
+18.13 support metalink in http headers
 
  Curl has support for downloading a metalink xml file, processing it, and then
  downloading the target of the metalink. This is done via the --metalink option.
  It would be nice if metalink also supported downloading via metalink
  information that is stored in HTTP headers (RFC 6249). Theoretically this could
  also be supported with the --metalink option.
 
  See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6249

  failure:
 
     curl -v --fail -O https://example.com/curl-7.48.0.tar.gz
 
  ... --fail must treat 3xx responses as failures too. The least problematic
  way to implement this is probably to add that new logic in the command line
  tool only and not in the underlying CURLOPT_FAILONERROR logic.

 Building via IDE Project Files

    Some of the project configurations allow the use of WinSSL (specifically
    SChannel from Windows SSPI), the native SSL library in Windows. However,
    WinSSL in Windows <= XP is unable to connect to servers that no longer
    support the legacy handshakes and algorithms used by those versions. If
    you will be using curl in one of those earlier versions of Windows you
    should choose another SSL backend such as OpenSSL.

-TODO
-====

-   These project files are a recent addition to the curl source code and as such
-   are not 100% complete. This is a list of things that are still todo:
-
-   * Support zlib
-   * Use of static runtime libraries
-   * Add the Test Suite components
-   * Support for other development IDEs
-   * Add PATH environment variables for third-party DLLs
-
