-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 85f4075bdbf3
+- test506: verify aa6884845168
   
-  Possibly the final update before release...
+  After the fixed cookie lock deadlock, this test now passes and it
+  detects double-locking and double-unlocking of mutexes.
 
-Steve Holme (20 May 2014)
-- README: Added some outstanding tasks to the TODO list
-  
-  Added a couple of outstanding tasks to the TODO section that we didn't
-  get time to do before the release.
+- [Yousuke Kimoto brought this change]
 
-Daniel Stenberg (20 May 2014)
-- http2: make connection re-use work
+  cookie: avoid mutex deadlock
   
-  Http2 connections would wrongly get closed after each individual
-  request.
+  ... by removing the extra mutex locks around th call to
+  Curl_flush_cookies() which takes care of the locking itself already.

-
-  ALPN: fix typo in http/1.1 identifier
+- gnutls: fix compiler warning
   
-  According to https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg-05
-  it is "http/1.1" and not "http/1.0".
+  conversion to 'int' from 'long int' may alter its value

-- build-openssl.bat: Added check for OpenSSL source directory
+Dan Fandrich (15 Jul 2014)
+- test320: strip off the actual negotiated cipher width
+  
+  It's irrelevant to the test, and will change depending on which SSL
+  library is being used by libcurl.
 
-- build-openssl.bat: Added default source directory when not specified
+- gnutls: detect lack of SRP support in GnuTLS at run-time and try without
   
-  Added a default source directory so the user doesn't have to specify
-  one - the same as that, which the Visual Studio project files expect
-  the OpenSSL dependencies to be in.
+  Reported-by: David Woodhouse
 
-- Makefile.am: Fixed missing / in VC10+ project file generation
+Daniel Stenberg (14 Jul 2014)
+- [Michał Górny brought this change]
 
-- INSTALL: Updated MSVC 6 caveats
+  configure: respect host tool prefix for krb5-config
   
-  To use an up to date download link as well as remove duplicate
-  information.
+  Use ${host_alias}-krb5-config if available. This improves cross-
+  compilation support and fixes multilib on Gentoo (at least).
 
-- INSTALL: Updated for new Visual Studio project files
+- [David Woodhouse brought this change]
 
-- build: Slight rename of new LIB_* makefile file variables
+  gnutls: handle IP address in cert name check
   
-  In order to try and be consistent between curl and libcurl renamed the
-  recently introduced LIB_* makefile file variables.
+  Before GnuTLS 3.3.6, the gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname() function
+  didn't actually check IP addresses in SubjectAltName, even though it was
+  explicitly documented as doing so. So do it ourselves...
 
-- build: Removed old Visual Studio project files
+Dan Fandrich (14 Jul 2014)
+- build: set _POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS on Solaris to get proper getpwuid_r
 
-Daniel Stenberg (18 May 2014)
-- maketgz: two more CRLF
-  
-  grrr, missed them in my previous fix
+Daniel Stenberg (14 Jul 2014)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: next one is called 7.37.1
 
-- test1014: GSS-API is only in curl-config. not in curl
+Dan Fandrich (13 Jul 2014)
+- gnutls: improved error message if setting cipher list fails
   
-  Follow-up to commit 121bcfee5d1. curl-config --features now lists
-  GSS-API but it is not a listed feature in curl -V. This should probably
-  be synchronized.
+  Reported-by: David Woodhouse
 
-- test1134: verify CREDSPERREQUEST for HTTP
+- netrc: fixed thread safety problem by using getpwuid_r if available
   
-  Verifies that the change in 68f0166a92 works as intended and that
-  different HTTP auth credentials to the same host still re-uses the
-  connection properly.
-
-- maketgz: remove CRLF newlines
-
-Steve Holme (18 May 2014)
-- Makefile.am: Corrected a couple of grammar errors
+  The old way using getpwuid could cause problems in programs that enable
+  reading from netrc files simultaneously in multiple threads.
+  
+  Reported-by: David Woodhouse
 
-- Makefile.am: Added new Visual Studio project file generation for curl tool
+- RELEASE-NOTES: add the reporter of the previous bug fix
 
-- Makefile.inc: Added resource file to assist Visual Studio project generation
+- netrc: treat failure to find home dir same as missing netrc file
+  
+  This previously caused a fatal error (with a confusing error code, at
+  that).
+  
+  Reported by: Glen A Johnson Jr.
 
-- [Daniel Stenberg brought this change]
+Steve Holme (12 Jul 2014)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with aaaf9e50ec
 
-  maketgz: run make vc-ide before make dist
+- ntlm_wb: Fixed buffer size not being large enough for NTLMv2 sessions
   
-  To get the VC project files generated before packaging!
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2014-07/0103.html
+  Reported-by: David Woodhouse
 
-- Makefile.am: Added new Visual Studio project file generation for libcurl
+- build: Fixed overridden compiler PDB settings in VC7 to VC12
+  
+  The curl tool project files for VC7 to VC12 would override the default
+  setting with the output filename being the same as the linker PDB file.
+  As such the compiler file would be overwritten with the linker file
+  for all debug builds.
+  
+  To avoid this overwrite and for consistency with the libcurl project
+  files, removed the setting to force the default filename to be used.
 
-- Makefile.am: Removed old Visual Studio project file generation
+Dan Fandrich (12 Jul 2014)
+- tests: added globbing keyword to URL globbing tests
 
-Daniel Stenberg (17 May 2014)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 831f6dd1d986c9
+- Fixed some "statement not reached" warnings
 
-Steve Holme (17 May 2014)
-- build: Fixed another tabulation issue in the Visual Studio file generator
+- gnutls: fixed a couple of uninitialized variable references
 
-Dan Fandrich (17 May 2014)
-- axtls: Fixed too long source line
+- gnutls: fixed compilation against versions < 2.12.0
+  
+  The AES-GCM ciphers were added to GnuTLS as late as ver. 3.0.1 but
+  the code path in which they're referenced here is only ever used for
+  somewhat older GnuTLS versions. This caused undeclared identifier errors
+  when compiling against those.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (17 May 2014)
-- configure: add GSS-API to supported features
+- gnutls: explicitly added SRP to the priority string
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1344
-  Reported-by: Michael Osipov
+  This seems to have become necessary for SRP support to work starting
+  with GnuTLS ver. 2.99.0. Since support for SRP was added to GnuTLS
+  before the function that takes this priority string, there should be no
+  issue with backward compatibility.
 
-- configure: add SPNEGO to supported features
+- tests: adjust for capitalization differences in newer gnutls-serv
+
+- test320/1/2/4: fix the port number substitution variables
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1343
-  Reported-by: Michael Osipov
+  These tests have been broken since commit 1958fe57 in Oct. 2011
 
-Dan Fandrich (16 May 2014)
-- axtls: Add a TODO to a potential blocking call with no timeout
+- tests: document more test identifiers and variables
 
-Daniel Stenberg (16 May 2014)
-- curl_easy_getinfo.3: clarify CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD
+- gnutls: ignore invalid certificate dates with VERIFYPEER disabled
   
-  It counts "body" data only, no meta data, no headers.
+  This makes the behaviour consistent with what happens if a date can
+  be extracted from the certificate but is expired.
 
-- curl_easy_setopt.3: prefer XFERINFOFUNCTION to PROGRESSFUNCTION
+Steve Holme (10 Jul 2014)
+- CURLOPT_UPLOAD: Corrected argument type
 
-- HTTP: CREDSPERREQUEST is for HTTP too
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Jul 2014)
+- FAQ: expand the thread-safe section
   
-  Commit 517b06d657ace (in 7.36.0) that brought the CREDSPERREQUEST flag
-  only set it for HTTPS, making HTTP less good at doing connection re-use
-  than it should be. Now set it for HTTP as well.
+  ... with a mention of *NOSIGNAL, based on talk in bug #1386
+
+Dan Fandrich (9 Jul 2014)
+- url.c: Fixed memory leak on OOM
   
-  Simple test case
+  This showed itself on some systems with torture failures
+  in tests 1060 and 1061
+
+- Update instances of some obsolete CURLOPTs to their new names
+
+Daniel Stenberg (5 Jul 2014)
+- [Marcel Raad brought this change]

+- nss: make the list of CRL items global
+  
+  Otherwise NSS could use an already freed item for another connection.
 
-- CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT: assign at first connect call
+- nss: fix a memory leak when CURLOPT_CRLFILE is used
+
+- nss: make crl_der allocated on heap
   
-  The variable wasn't assigned at all until step3 which would lead to a
-  failed connect never assigning the variable and thus returning a bad
-  value.
+  ... and spell it as crl_der instead of crlDER
+
+- nss: let nss_{cache,load}_crl return CURLcode
+
+- tool: oops, forgot to include <plarenas.h>
   
-  Reported-by: Larry Lin
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2014-04/0203.html
+  ... that contains the declaration of PL_ArenaFinish()
 
-- timers: fix timer regression involving redirects / reconnects
+- tool: call PL_ArenaFinish() on exit if NSPR is used
   
-  In commit 0b3750b5c23c25f (released in 7.36.0) we fixed a timeout issue
-  but instead broke the timings.
+  This prevents valgrind from reporting still reachable memory allocated
+  by NSPR arenas (mainly the freelist).
   
-  To fix this, I introduce a new timestamp to use for the timeouts and
-  restored the previous timestamp and timestamp position so that the old
-  timer functionality is restored.

+
+- curl.1: minor language fix
   
-  In addition to that, that change also broke connection timeouts for when
-  more than one connect was used (as it would then count the total time
-  from the first connect and not for the most recent one). Now
-  Curl_timeleft() has been modified so that it checks against different
-  start times depending on which timeout it checks.

+
+- [Ray Satiro brought this change]
+
+  progress callback: skip last callback update on errors
   
-  Test 1303 is updated accordingly.
+  When an error has been detected, skip the final forced call to the
+  progress callback by making sure to pass the current return code
+  variable in the Curl_done() call in the CURLM_STATE_DONE state.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2014-05/0147.html
-  Reported-by: Ryan Braud
+  This avoids the "extra" callback that could occur even if you returned
+  error from the progress callback.

+Kamil Dudka (2 Jul 2014)
+- tool: call PR_Cleanup() on exit if NSPR is used
   
-  This could've happened if SecPKCS12Import() returned noErr _and_ no
-  identity.
+  This prevents valgrind from reporting possibly lost memory that NSPR
+  uses for file descriptor cache and other globally allocated internal
+  data structures.

-- url: only use if_nametoindex() if IFNAMSIZ is available
+  Security Framework on OS X makes it possible to supply extra anchor (CA)
+  certificates via the Certificate, Key, and Trust Services API. This
+  commit makes the '--cacert' option work using this API.
+  
+  More information:
+  
+  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/security/Reference/certifkeytrustservices/Reference/reference.html
+  
+  The HTTPS tests now pass on OS X except 314, which requires the '--crl'

-- build: Added Visual Studio 2008 (VC9) project files
+- bits.close: Fixed compilation warning
   
-  Carrying on from commit 11025613b9, added VC9 project files which are
-  capable of supporting side-by-side compilation, 32-bit and 64-bit
-  builds as well as support for some of the third-party libraries curl
-  uses.

-- sas: Added DIGEST-MD5 qop-option validation in native challange handling
+Daniel Stenberg (22 May 2014)
+- bits.close: introduce connection close tracking
   
-  Given that we presently support "auth" and not "auth-int" or "auth-conf"
-  for native challenge-response messages, added client side validation of
-  the quality-of-protection options from the server's challenge message.
+  Make all code use connclose() and connkeep() when changing the "close
+  state" for a connection. These two macros take a string argument with an
+  explanation, and debug builds of curl will include that in the debug
+  output. Helps tracking connection re-use/close issues.

-  ... the recent MSVC project files added by Steve Holme
+  Renamed the CURLX_ONES file list definition in order to a) try and be
+  consistent with other file lists and b) to allow for the addition of
+  the curlx header files, which will assist with Visual Studio project
+  files generation rather than hard coding those files.

+  To fix this, I introduce a new timestamp to use for the timeouts and

-  Since all present tests now have <keywords> listed, this script will now
-  refuse to run a given test case if no such section is provided.
-  Hopefully this will help us make sure new test cases get keywords added
-  at start.
+  In addition to that, that change also broke connection timeouts for when
+  more than one connect was used (as it would then count the total time
+  from the first connect and not for the most recent one). Now

-  is updated but because of the getsock has not the proper #define macro to,
-  the library never prevents to select socket for input thus the socket will
-  never be awaken when last data is available. Thus it leads to timeout.

+Daniel Stenberg (4 May 2014)
+- openssl: biomem->data is not zero terminated
   
-  API has changed since version 1.3. A compatibility header has been created
-  to ensure forward compatibility for code using old API:
-   * x509 certificate structure has been renamed to from x509_cert to
-     x509_crt
-   * new dedicated setter for RSA certificates ssl_set_own_cert_rsa,
-     ssl_set_own_cert is for generic keys
-   * ssl_default_ciphersuites has been replaced by function
-     ssl_list_ciphersuites()
+  So printf(%s) on it or reading before bounds checking is wrong, fixing
+  it. Could previously lead to reading out of boundary.

-  Setting the TIMER_STARTSINGLE timestamp first in CONNECT has the

+- imap: Fixed untagged response detection when no data after command
   
-  In preparation for parsing global options added the GlobalConfig
-  structure to the getparameter() function.
+  Should a command return untagged responses that contained no data then
+  the imap_matchresp() function would not detect them as valid responses,
+  as it wasn't taking the CRLF characters into account at the end of each
+  line.

+- sas: Added DIGEST-MD5 qop-option validation in native challange handling
   
-  Side-effect of this change:
-   SChannel and CryptoAPI do not support the iPAddress subjectAltName
-   according to RFC 2818. If present, SChannel will first compare the
-   IP address to the dNSName subjectAltNames and then fallback to the
-   most specific Common Name in the Subject field of the certificate.
+  Given that we presently support "auth" and not "auth-int" or "auth-conf"
+  for native challenge-response messages, added client side validation of
+  the quality-of-protection options from the server's challenge message.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (8 Apr 2014)
+- dist: include the projects/ files in releases
   
-   This means that after this change curl will not connect to SSL/TLS

-- stunnel: regenerated self-signed test certificate with SHA1 hash
+Daniel Stenberg (4 Apr 2014)
+- curl_easy_setopt: fix wrong version number references
+
+- docs: this is for 7.37.0
   
-  The previous test certificate contained a MD5 hash which is not
-  supported using TLSv1.2 with Schannel on Windows 7 or newer.
+  And clarify for curl that --proxy-header now must be used for headers
+  that are meant for a proxy, and they will not be included if the request
+  is not for a proxy.
+
+- PROXYHEADER: send these headers in "normal" proxy requests too
   
-  See the update to this blog post on IEInternals / MSDN:
-  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/03/25/
-  misbehaving-https-servers-impair-tls-1.1-and-tls-1.2.aspx
+  Updated the docs to clarify and the code accordingly, with test 1528 to
+  verify:
   
-  "Update: If the server negotiates a TLS1.2 connection with a
-  Windows 7 or 8 schannel.dll-using client application, and it
-  provides a certificate chain which uses the (weak) MD5 hash
-  algorithm, the client will abort the connection (TCP/IP FIN)
-  upon receipt of the certificate."
+  When CURLHEADER_SEPARATE is set and libcurl is asked to send a request
+  to a proxy but it isn't CONNECT, then _both_ header lists
+  (CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER and CURLOPT_PROXYHEADER) will be used since the
+  single request is then made for both the proxy and the server.

+- [Till Maas brought this change]
 
-  axtls: call ssl_read repeatedly
-  
-  Perform more work in between sleeps. This is work around the
-  fact that axtls does not expose any knowledge about when work needs
-  to be performed. Depending on connection and how often perform is
-  being called this can save ~25% of time on SSL handshakes (measured
-  on 20ms latency connection calling perform roughly every 10ms).

-  url_easy_setopt.3: Add undocumented values of curl_infotype
+  curl: stop interpreting IPv6 literals as glob patterns.
   
-  ... for debug function
-
-- ConnectionExists: re-use connections better
+  This makes it possible to fetch from an IPv6 literal without specifying
+  the -g option.  Globbing remains available elsehwere in the URL.
   
-  When allowing NTLM, the re-use connection logic was too focused on
-  finding an existing NTLM connection to use and didn't properly allow
-  re-use of other ones. This made the logic not re-use perfectly re-usable
-  connections.
+  For example:
+    curl http://[::1]/file[1-3].txt
   
-  Added test case 1418 and 1419 to verify.
+  This creates no ambiguity, because there is no overlap between the
+  syntax of valid globs and valid IPv6 literals.  Globs contain hyphens
+  and at most 1 colon, while IPv6 literals have no hyphens, and at least 2
+  colons.
   
-  Regression brought in 8ae35102c (curl 7.35.0)
+  The peek_ipv6() parser simply whitelists a set of characters and counts
+  colons, because the real validation happens later on.  The character set
+  includes A-Z, in case someone decides to implement support for scopes
+  like [fe80::1%25eth0] in the future.

-  Updates the test suite to handle binary-mode header output.
+  As the email protocols implement SASL authentication rather than IMAP,
+  POP3 and SMTP specific authentication, updated the authentication
+  keywords to reflect this.
 
-- curl: output protocol headers using binary mode
-  
-  Since protocol headers contain explicit line-endings there should
-  be no automatic conversion to ASCII text or CRLF line-endings.
-  
-  This might break third party tools that already depend on this
-  behaviour. We might need to introduce an option to make this optional.
+- tests: Added "Clear Text" authentication keyword
 
-- HTTP tests: use CRLF as header seperator according to RFC 2616
-  
-  Changes LF to CRLF and disables automatic output conversion.
+- tests: Added "SASL" authentication keyword
 
-- testsuite: use binary output mode for custom curl test tools
-  
-  Do not try to convert line-endings to CRLF on Windows by setting stdout
-  to binary mode, just like the curl tool does if --ascii is not specified.
-  
-  This should prevent corrupted stdout line-ending output like CRCRLF.
+- imap-append.c: Fixed compilation errors on some platforms
   
-  In order to make the previously naive text-aware tests work with
-  binary mode on Windows, text-mode is disabled for them if it is not
-  actually part of the test case and line-endings are corrected.
+  In the initializer for len, there is no prototype for "strlen".
+  In this statement, there is no prototype for "memcpy".
 
-- testsuite: changed HTTP and RTSP header line-endings to CRLF
-  
-  According to RFC 2616 and RFC 2326 individual protocol elements, like
-  headers and except the actual content, are terminated by using CRLF.
-  
-  Therefore the test data files for these protocols need to contain
-  mixed line-endings if the actual protocol elements use CRLF while
-  the file uses LF.

-  fail to match. The underlying reason for these idna suppressions is
-  a gcc strlen optimization when compiling libidn; compiling it with

-  HTTP2: add layer between existing http and socket(TLS) layer
+- tool: Do not output libcurl source for the information only parameters
   
-  This patch chooses different approach to integrate HTTP2 into HTTP curl
-  stack. The idea is that we insert HTTP2 layer between HTTP code and
-  socket(TLS) layer. When HTTP2 is initialized (either in NPN or Upgrade),
-  we replace the Curl_recv/Curl_send callbacks with HTTP2's, but keep the
-  original callbacks in http_conn struct. When sending serialized data by
-  nghttp2, we use original Curl_send callback. Likewise, when reading data
-  from network, we use original Curl_recv callback. In this way we can
-  treat both TLS and non-TLS connections.
+  Ensure a source file isn't generated for the following informational
+  command line parameters when --libcurl is specified:
   
-  With this patch, one can transfer contents from https://twitter.com and
-  from nghttp2 test server in plain HTTP as well.
+  --help, --manual, --version and --engine list
   
-  The code still has rough edges. The notable one is I could not figure
-  out how to call nghttp2_session_send() when underlying socket is
-  writable.
-
-- [Fabian Frank brought this change]

+  and a call to curl_easy_init() and curl_easy_cleanup() when performed

-  gtls: add ALPN support
+- tool: Fixed libcurl source output for multiple operations

-  built with GnuTLS.
+  Correctly output libcurl source code that includes multiply operations
+  as specified by --next. Note that each operation evaluates to a single
+  curl_easy_perform() in source code form.

+  Side-effect of this change:

+- lib1515.c: Added support for Windows using the Sleep function
 
-- sockfilt.c: fixed and simplified Windows select function
+- HTTP tests: use CRLF as header seperator according to RFC 2616
   
-  Since the previous complex select function with initial support for
-  non-socket file descriptors, did not actually work correctly for
-  Console handles, this change simplifies the whole procedure by using
-  an internal waiting thread for the stdin console handle.
+  Updates the test suite to handle binary-mode header output.
+
+- curl: output protocol headers using binary mode
   
-  The previous implementation made it continuously trigger for the stdin
-  handle if it was being redirected to a parent process instead of
-  an actual Console input window.
+  Since protocol headers contain explicit line-endings there should
+  be no automatic conversion to ASCII text or CRLF line-endings.
   
-  This approach supports actual Console input handles as well as
-  anonymous Pipe handles which are used during input redirection.
+  This might break third party tools that already depend on this
+  behaviour. We might need to introduce an option to make this optional.
+
+- HTTP tests: use CRLF as header seperator according to RFC 2616
   
-  It depends on the fact that ReadFile supports trying to read zero bytes
-  which makes it wait for the handle to become ready for reading.
+  Changes LF to CRLF and disables automatic output conversion.
 
-- http_pipe.py: replaced epoll with select to support Windows
+- testsuite: use binary output mode for custom curl test tools

-  - select.epoll replaced with select.select
-  - SocketServer.ForkingMixIn replaced with SocketServer.ForkingMixIn
-  - socket.MSG_DONTWAIT replaced with socket.setblocking(False)
+  Do not try to convert line-endings to CRLF on Windows by setting stdout
+  to binary mode, just like the curl tool does if --ascii is not specified.
   
-  Even though epoll has a better performance and improved socket handling
-  than select, this change should not affect the actual test case.

-- tests: Added missing HTTP proxy keywords

-- tests: added missing <features> http to a number of tests
+- testsuite: changed HTTP and RTSP header line-endings to CRLF
+  
+  According to RFC 2616 and RFC 2326 individual protocol elements, like

+  
+  Therefore the test data files for these protocols need to contain

+  For a function that returns a decoded version of a string, it seems

-- multi_socket: remind app if timeout didn't run
-  
-  BACKGROUND:
-  
-  We have learned that on some systems timeout timers are inaccurate and
-  might occasionally fire off too early. To make the multi_socket API work
-  with this, we made libcurl execute timeout actions a bit early too if
-  they are within our MULTI_TIMEOUT_INACCURACY. (added in commit
-  2c72732ebf, present since 7.21.0)
-  
-  Switching everything to the multi API made this inaccuracy problem
-  slightly more notable as now everyone can be affected.
-  
-  Recently (commit 21091549c02) we tweaked that inaccuracy value to make
-  timeouts more accurate and made it platform specific. We also figured
-  out that we have code at places that check for fixed timeout values so
-  they MUST NOT run too early as then they will not trigger at all (see
-  commit be28223f35 and a691e044705) - so there are definitately problems
-  with running timeouts before they're supposed to run. (We've handled
-  that so far by adding the inaccuracy margin to those specific timeouts.)
-  
-  The libcurl multi_socket API tells the application with a callback that
-  a timeout expires in N milliseconds (and it explicitly will not tell it
-  again for the same timeout), and the application is then supposed to
-  call libcurl when that timeout expires. When libcurl subsequently gets
-  called with curl_multi_socket_action(...CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT...), it
-  knows that the application thinks the timeout expired - and alas, if it
-  is within the inaccuracy level libcurl will run code handling that
-  handle.
+- tool_operate: Introduced operate_init() function
+
+- tool_operate: Introduced new operate() function
+
+Daniel Stenberg (4 Feb 2014)
+- http2: enforce gzip auto-decompress
   
-  If the application says CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT to libcurl and _isn't_
-  within the inaccuracy level, libcurl will not consider the timeout
-  expired and it will not tell the application again since the timeout
-  value is still the same.

+
+  HTTP2: add layer between existing http and socket(TLS) layer
   
-  NOW:
+  This patch chooses different approach to integrate HTTP2 into HTTP curl
+  stack. The idea is that we insert HTTP2 layer between HTTP code and
+  socket(TLS) layer. When HTTP2 is initialized (either in NPN or Upgrade),
+  we replace the Curl_recv/Curl_send callbacks with HTTP2's, but keep the
+  original callbacks in http_conn struct. When sending serialized data by
+  nghttp2, we use original Curl_send callback. Likewise, when reading data
+  from network, we use original Curl_recv callback. In this way we can
+  treat both TLS and non-TLS connections.
   
-  This change introduces a modified behavior here. If the application says
-  CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT and libcurl finds no timeout code to run, it will
-  inform the application about the timeout value - *again* even if it is
-  the same timeout that it already told about before (although libcurl
-  will of course tell it the updated time so that it'll still get the
-  correct remaining time). This way, we will not risk that the application
-  believes it has done its job and libcurl thinks the time hasn't come yet
-  to run any code and both just sit waiting. This also allows us to
-  decrease the MULTI_TIMEOUT_INACCURACY margin, but that will be handled
-  in a separate commit.
+  With this patch, one can transfer contents from https://twitter.com and
+  from nghttp2 test server in plain HTTP as well.
   
-  A repeated timeout update to the application risk that the timeout will
-  then fire again immediately and we have what basically is a busy-loop
-  until the time is fine even for libcurl. If that becomes a problem, we
-  need to address it.
+  The code still has rough edges. The notable one is I could not figure
+  out how to call nghttp2_session_send() when underlying socket is
+  writable.
 
-- threaded-resolver: never use NULL hints with getaddrinfo
-  
-  The net effect of this bug as it appeared to users, would be that
-  libcurl would timeout in the connect phase.

+
+  gtls: add ALPN support
   
-  When disabling IPv6 use but still using getaddrinfo, libcurl would
-  wrongly not init the "hints" struct field in init_thread_sync() which
-  would subsequently lead to a getaddrinfo() invoke with a zeroed hints
-  with ai_socktype set to 0 instead of SOCK_STREAM. This would lead to
-  different behaviors on different platforms but basically incorrect
-  output.
+  Add ALPN support when using GnuTLS >= 3.2.0. This allows
+  libcurl to negotiate HTTP/2.0 for https connections when
+  built with GnuTLS.
   
-  This code was introduced in 483ff1ca75cbea, released in curl 7.20.0.

+  Add ALPN support when using OpenSSL. This will offer ALPN and NPN to the
+  server, who can respond with either one or none of the two. OpenSSL >=
+  1.0.2 is required, which means as of today obtaining a snapshot from

+  According to section 2.2 of RFC959 the End-of-Line is defined as:
+   The end-of-line sequence defines the separation of printing
+   lines.  The sequence is Carriage Return, followed by Line Feed.
   
-  This has the unfortunate downside that if you include NTLM as a possible
-  auth, you cannot re-use connections for other usernames/passwords even
-  if NTLM doesn't end up the auth type used.

+- sockfilt.c: fixed and simplified Windows select function
   
-  Following commit 0aafd77fa4c6f2, replaced the internal usage of
-  FORMAT_OFF_T and FORMAT_OFF_TU with the external versions that we
-  expect API programmers to use.
+  Since the previous complex select function with initial support for
+  non-socket file descriptors, did not actually work correctly for
+  Console handles, this change simplifies the whole procedure by using
+  an internal waiting thread for the stdin console handle.
   
-  This negates the need for separate definitions which were subtly
-  different under different platforms/compilers.
+  The previous implementation made it continuously trigger for the stdin
+  handle if it was being redirected to a parent process instead of
+  an actual Console input window.
+  
+  This approach supports actual Console input handles as well as
+  anonymous Pipe handles which are used during input redirection.
+  
+  It depends on the fact that ReadFile supports trying to read zero bytes
+  which makes it wait for the handle to become ready for reading.
 
-- examples: Updated copyright year for recent edits
+- http_pipe.py: replaced epoll with select to support Windows
+  
+  Removed Unix-specific functionality in order to support Windows:
+  - select.epoll replaced with select.select
+  - SocketServer.ForkingMixIn replaced with SocketServer.ForkingMixIn
+  - socket.MSG_DONTWAIT replaced with socket.setblocking(False)
+  
+  Even though epoll has a better performance and improved socket handling
+  than select, this change should not affect the actual test case.

+  In the rare instance where getparameter() may return PARAM_NO_MEM whilst

+- multi_socket: remind app if timeout didn't run
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1313
-  Reported-by: Viktor Szakáts
+  BACKGROUND:
+  
+  We have learned that on some systems timeout timers are inaccurate and
+  might occasionally fire off too early. To make the multi_socket API work
+  with this, we made libcurl execute timeout actions a bit early too if
+  they are within our MULTI_TIMEOUT_INACCURACY. (added in commit
+  2c72732ebf, present since 7.21.0)
+  
+  Switching everything to the multi API made this inaccuracy problem
+  slightly more notable as now everyone can be affected.
+  
+  Recently (commit 21091549c02) we tweaked that inaccuracy value to make
+  timeouts more accurate and made it platform specific. We also figured
+  out that we have code at places that check for fixed timeout values so
+  they MUST NOT run too early as then they will not trigger at all (see
+  commit be28223f35 and a691e044705) - so there are definitately problems
+  with running timeouts before they're supposed to run. (We've handled
+  that so far by adding the inaccuracy margin to those specific timeouts.)
+  
+  The libcurl multi_socket API tells the application with a callback that
+  a timeout expires in N milliseconds (and it explicitly will not tell it
+  again for the same timeout), and the application is then supposed to
+  call libcurl when that timeout expires. When libcurl subsequently gets
+  called with curl_multi_socket_action(...CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT...), it
+  knows that the application thinks the timeout expired - and alas, if it
+  is within the inaccuracy level libcurl will run code handling that
+  handle.
+  
+  If the application says CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT to libcurl and _isn't_
+  within the inaccuracy level, libcurl will not consider the timeout
+  expired and it will not tell the application again since the timeout
+  value is still the same.
+  
+  NOW:
+  
+  This change introduces a modified behavior here. If the application says

-- curl.1: remove URL encoding phrase from --data description
+- threaded-resolver: never use NULL hints with getaddrinfo
+  
+  The net effect of this bug as it appeared to users, would be that
+  libcurl would timeout in the connect phase.
+  
+  When disabling IPv6 use but still using getaddrinfo, libcurl would
+  wrongly not init the "hints" struct field in init_thread_sync() which
+  would subsequently lead to a getaddrinfo() invoke with a zeroed hints
+  with ai_socktype set to 0 instead of SOCK_STREAM. This would lead to
+  different behaviors on different platforms but basically incorrect
+  output.
+  
+  This code was introduced in 483ff1ca75cbea, released in curl 7.20.0.
+  
+  This bug became a problem now due to the happy eyeballs code and how
+  libcurl now traverses the getaddrinfo() results differently.

+- pop3-stat.c: Corrected small typo from commit 91d62e9abd761c
 
-  parsedate: avoid integer overflow
-  
-  In C, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior. Thus, the compiler
-  is allowed to assume that it will not occur. In the check for an
-  overflow, the developer assumes that the signed integer of type time_t
-  will wrap around if it overflows. However, this behavior is undefined in
-  the C standard. Thus, when the compiler sees this, it simplifies t +
-  delta < t to delta < 0. Since delta > 0 and delta < 0 can't both be
-  true, the entire if statement is optimized out under certain
-  optimization levels. Thus, the parsedate function would return
-  PARSEDATE_OK with an undefined value in the time, instead of return -1 =
-  PARSEDATE_FAIL.
+- examples: Added POP3 STAT example
 
-- parseconfig: warn if unquoted white spaces are detected

-  end of the command, for example: "NOOP ".
-
-- tests: Added SMTP NOOP and RSET tests
-
-- test928: Corrected typo in expected data from commit df58084695ce9b
+  Following commit 0aafd77fa4c6f2, replaced the internal usage of
+  FORMAT_OFF_T and FORMAT_OFF_TU with the external versions that we
+  expect API programmers to use.
+  
+  This negates the need for separate definitions which were subtly
+  different under different platforms/compilers.
 
-- tests: Added SMTP HELP test
+- examples: Updated copyright year for recent edits
 
-- smtp: Changed the default command to HELP when no options are specified
-  
-  Otherwise a NOOP operation would be performed which a) only returns a
-  single line response and not a multiline response where -I needs to be
-  used, and b) provides an inconsistent user experience compared to that
-  of the POP3 and IMAP protocols.

-  even though the function returned a CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT error code
-  from commit ed1662c374361a and 02fbc26d59c591.
+  Added support to the built-in printf() replacement functions, for these
+  non-ANSI extensions when compiling under Visual Studio, Borland, Watcom
+  and MinGW.
   
-  This could cause tests 19, 704 and 1233 to fail on FreeBSD, AIX and

-- test926: Corrected unknown user reply from commit 0d735c29f92748
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: Added SMTP information to CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE
   
-  The error code should not be sent as data as it isn't passed onto the
-  client as body data, so cannot be compared in the test suite against
-  expected data.
-
-- tests: Corrected missing data reply sections from 3d50e91aeef8cc

-- smtp: Fixed processing of more than one response when sent in same packet
+  Following the addition of informational commands to the SMTP protocol,
+  the test server is no longer required to return the verified server
+  information in responses that curl only outputs in verbose mode.
   
-  Added a loop to smtp_statemach_act() in which Curl_pp_readresp() is
-  called until the cache is drained. Without this multiple responses
-  received in a single packet could result in a hang or delay.
+  Instead, a similar detection mechanism to that used by FTP, IMAP and
+  POP3 can now be used.
 
-- smtp: Moved EHLO response handling to smtp_state_ehlo_resp()
+- sendf.c: Fixed compilation warning from f2d234a4dd9bcc
   
-  Similar to the processing of untagged CAPABILITY responses in IMAP moved
-  the processing of multiline EHLO responses to smtp_state_ehlo_resp() and
-  introduced an internal response code of one to differentiate a multiline
-  continuation from the end of command. This also allows for the separate
-  processing of multiline responses from commands such as VRFY and EXPN.

-  the socket is always returned.
+  Introduced in commit 2a4ee0d2215556 sending of data via the FILE

-- darwinssl: check for SSLSetSessionOption() presence when toggling BEAST
+Steve Holme (24 Dec 2013)
+- imap: Fixed auth preference not being honored when CAPABILITY not supported
   
-  Even though this is only a formality (since not many people build on
-  Mavericks while targeting Leopard), since we still support Leopard
-  at the earliest, we might as well be pedantic.
+  If a user indicated they preferred to authenticate using a SASL
+  mechanism, but SASL authentication wasn't supported by the server, curl
+  would always fall back to clear text when CAPABILITY wasn't supported,
+  even though the user didn't want to use this.
 
-- darwinssl: PKCS#12 import feature now requires Lion or later
+- pop3: Fixed auth preference not being honored when CAPA not supported
   
-  It turns out that some of the constants necessary to make this feature
-  work are missing from Snow Leopard's Security framework even though
-  they are defined in the headers.
+  If a user indicated they preferred to authenticate using APOP or a SASL
+  mechanism, but neither were supported by the server, curl would always
+  fall back to clear text when CAPA wasn't supported, even though the
+  user didn't want to use this.

-  This is temporary until curl supports either multiple custom commands
-  or post-quote commands in IMAP.
+  Added support for downgrading the SASL authentication mechanism when the
+  decoding of CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM messages fails. This enhances
+  the previously added support for graceful cancellation by allowing the
+  client to retry a lesser SASL mechanism such as LOGIN or PLAIN, or even
+  APOP / clear text (in the case of POP3 and IMAP) when supported by the
+  server.

-- base64: Added basic validation to base64 input string when decoding

-  A base64 string should be a multiple of 4 characters in length, not
-  contain any more than 2 padding characters and only contain padding
-  characters at the end of string. For example: Y3VybA==
+  Since all systems have inaccuracy in the timeout handling it is
+  imperative that we add an inaccuracy margin to the general timeout and
+  connecttimeout handling with the multi interface. This way, when the
+  timeout fires we should be fairly sure that it has passed the timeout
+  value and will be suitably detected.
   
-  Strings such as the following are considered invalid:
+  For cases where the timeout fire before the actual timeout, we would
+  otherwise consume the timeout action and still not run the timeout code
+  since the condition wasn't met.
   
-  Y=   - Invalid length
-  Y==  - Invalid length
-  Y=== - More than two padding characters
-  Y=x= - Padding character contained within string

+  To avoid the regression when users pass in passwords containing semi-
+  colons, we now drop the ability to set the login options with the same

+  as part of the login options but wasn't supported by the server then

-- email: Added support for cancelling NTLM authentication
+  parsedate: avoid integer overflow
+  
+  In C, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior. Thus, the compiler
+  is allowed to assume that it will not occur. In the check for an
+  overflow, the developer assumes that the signed integer of type time_t
+  will wrap around if it overflows. However, this behavior is undefined in
+  the C standard. Thus, when the compiler sees this, it simplifies t +
+  delta < t to delta < 0. Since delta > 0 and delta < 0 can't both be
+  true, the entire if statement is optimized out under certain
+  optimization levels. Thus, the parsedate function would return
+  PARSEDATE_OK with an undefined value in the time, instead of return -1 =
+  PARSEDATE_FAIL.
 
-- sasl: Removed unused variables from commit b87ba2c94217c0

+  
+  This code detects unquoted white spaces in the parameter when parsing a
+  config file as that would be one symptom and it is generally a bad
+  syntax anyway.

-Steve Holme (20 Oct 2013)
-- ftpserver.pl: Fixed syntax error from commit 5b31b38c27bb7a
-
-- test866: Fixed user response from commit 7f7fbe7fbdb449
-
-- ftpserver.pl: Fixed processing of POP3 authentication strings
+  When adding entries to the DNS cache with CURLOPT_RESOLVE, they are
+  marked 'inuse' forever to prevent them from ever being removed in normal
+  operations. Still, the code that pruned out-of-date DNS entries didn't
+  care for the 'inuse' struct field and pruned it anyway!
   
-  ...and corrected response when check fails from 500 to -ERR.
-
-- tests: Added POP3 NTLM authentication test
-
-- tests: Added POP3 CRAM-MD5 authentication test
-
-- tests: Added POP3 login authentication test
+  Reported-by: Romulo A. Ceccon
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1303
 
-- tests: Added POP3 plain authentication test

 <p class="level0">A connection can be paused by using this function or by letting the read or the write callbacks return the proper magic return code (<span Class="emphasis">CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE</span> and <span Class="emphasis">CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE</span>). A write callback that returns pause signals to the library that it couldn't take care of any data at all, and that data will then be delivered again to the callback when the writing is later unpaused. 
-<p class="level0">While it may feel tempting, take care and notice that you cannot call this function from another thread. To unpause, you may for example call it from the progress callback (see <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt(3)</a>'s <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION</span>), which gets called at least once per second, even if the connection is paused. 
+<p class="level0">While it may feel tempting, take care and notice that you cannot call this function from another thread. To unpause, you may for example call it from the progress callback (see <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>'s <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION(3)</span>), which gets called at least once per second, even if the connection is paused. 
 <p class="level0">When this function is called to unpause reading, the chance is high that you will get your write callback called before this function returns. 
 <p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">handle</span> argument is of course identifying the handle that operates on the connection you want to pause or unpause. 
 <p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">bitmask</span> argument is a set of bits that sets the new state of the connection. The following bits can be used: 
 <p class="level0"><a name="CURLPAUSERECV"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLPAUSE_RECV</span> 
-<p class="level1">Pause receiving data. There will be no data received on this connection until this function is called again without this bit set. Thus, the write callback (<span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</span>) won't be called. 
+<p class="level1">Pause receiving data. There will be no data received on this connection until this function is called again without this bit set. Thus, the write callback (<span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)</span>) won't be called. 
 <p class="level0"><a name="CURLPAUSESEND"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLPAUSE_SEND</span>

 <p class="level0">CURLE_OK (zero) means that the option was set properly, and a non-zero return code means something wrong occurred after the new state was set.  See the <span Class="emphasis">libcurl-errors(3)</span> man page for the full list with descriptions. <a name="LIMITATIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">LIMITATIONS</h2>
 <p class="level0">The pausing of transfers does not work with protocols that work without network connectivity, like FILE://. Trying to pause such a transfer, in any direction, will cause problems in the worst case or an error in the best case. <a name="AVAILABILITY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">AVAILABILITY</h2>
 <p class="level0">This function was added in libcurl 7.18.0. Before this version, there was no explicit support for pausing transfers. <a name="USAGE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USAGE WITH THE MULTI-SOCKET INTERFACE</h2>
 <p class="level0">Before libcurl 7.32.0, when a specific handle was unpaused with this function, there was no particular forced rechecking or similar of the socket's state, which made the continuation of the transfer get delayed until next multi-socket call invoke or even longer. Alternatively, the user could forcibly call for example curl_multi_socket_all(3) - with a rather hefty performance penalty. 
 <p class="level0">Starting in libcurl 7.32.0, unpausing a transfer will schedule a timeout trigger for that handle 1 millisecond into the future, so that a curl_multi_socket_action( ... CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT) can be used immediately afterwards to get the transfer going again as desired. <a name="MEMORY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">MEMORY USE</h2>
 <p class="level0">When pausing a read by returning the magic return code from a write callback, the read data is already in libcurl's internal buffers so it'll have to keep it in an allocated buffer until the reading is again unpaused using this function. 
 <p class="level0">If the downloaded data is compressed and is asked to get uncompressed automatically on download, libcurl will continue to uncompress the entire downloaded chunk and it will cache the data uncompressed. This has the side- effect that if you download something that is compressed a lot, it can result in a very large data amount needing to be allocated to save the data during the pause. This said, you should probably consider not using paused reading if you allow libcurl to uncompress data automatically. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>

 between transfers, so if you want subsequent transfers with different options,
 you must change them between the transfers. You can optionally reset all
 options back to internal default with \fIcurl_easy_reset(3)\fP.
 
 Strings passed to libcurl as 'char *' arguments, are copied by the library;
 thus the string storage associated to the pointer argument may be overwritten
-after curl_easy_setopt() returns. Exceptions to this rule are described in
-the option details below.
+after curl_easy_setopt() returns. The only exception to this rule is really
+\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP, but the alternative that copies the string
+\fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP has some usage characteristics you need to
+read up on.
 
 Before version 7.17.0, strings were not copied. Instead the user was forced
 keep them available until libcurl no longer needed them.
 
 The \fIhandle\fP is the return code from a \fIcurl_easy_init(3)\fP or
 \fIcurl_easy_duphandle(3)\fP call.
 .SH BEHAVIOR OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_VERBOSE
-Set the parameter to 1 to get the library to display a lot of verbose
-information about its operations. Very useful for libcurl and/or protocol
-debugging and understanding. The verbose information will be sent to stderr,
-or the stream set with \fICURLOPT_STDERR\fP. The default value for this
-parameter is 0.
-
-You hardly ever want this set in production use, you will almost always want
-this when you debug/report problems. Another neat option for debugging is the
-\fICURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION\fP.
+Display verbose information. See \fICURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HEADER
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to include the header in the body
-output. This is only relevant for protocols that actually have headers
-preceding the data (like HTTP). The default value for this parameter is 0.
+Include the header in the body output. See \fICURLOPT_HEADER(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS
-Pass a long. If set to 1, it tells the library to shut off the progress meter
-completely. It will also prevent the \fICURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION\fP from
-getting called. The default value for this parameter is 1.
-
-Future versions of libcurl are likely to not have any built-in progress meter
-at all.
+Shut off the progress meter. See \fICURLOPT_NOPROGRESS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL
-Pass a long. If it is 1, libcurl will not use any functions that
-install signal handlers or any functions that cause signals to be sent to the
-process. This option is mainly here to allow multi-threaded unix applications
-to still set/use all timeout options etc, without risking getting signals.
-The default value for this parameter is 0.
-(Added in 7.10)
-
-If this option is set and libcurl has been built with the standard name
-resolver, timeouts will not occur while the name resolve takes place.
-Consider building libcurl with c-ares support to enable asynchronous DNS
-lookups, which enables nice timeouts for name resolves without signals.
-
-Setting \fICURLOPT_NOSIGNAL\fP to 1 makes libcurl NOT ask the system to ignore
-SIGPIPE signals, which otherwise are sent by the system when trying to send
-data to a socket which is closed in the other end. libcurl makes an effort to
-never cause such SIGPIPEs to trigger, but some operating systems have no way
-to avoid them and even on those that have there are some corner cases when
-they may still happen, contrary to our desire. In addition, using
-\fICURLAUTH_NTLM_WB\fP authentication could cause a SIGCHLD signal to be
-raised.
+Do not install signal handlers. See \fICURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH
-Set this option to 1 if you want to transfer multiple files according to a
-file name pattern. The pattern can be specified as part of the
-\fICURLOPT_URL\fP option, using an fnmatch-like pattern (Shell Pattern
-Matching) in the last part of URL (file name).
-
-By default, libcurl uses its internal wildcard matching implementation. You
-can provide your own matching function by the \fICURLOPT_FNMATCH_FUNCTION\fP
-option.
-
-This feature is only supported by the FTP download for now.
-
-A brief introduction of its syntax follows:
-.RS
-.IP "* - ASTERISK"
-\&ftp://example.com/some/path/\fB*.txt\fP (for all txt's from the root
-directory)
-.RE
-.RS
-.IP "? - QUESTION MARK"
-Question mark matches any (exactly one) character.
-
-\&ftp://example.com/some/path/\fBphoto?.jpeg\fP
-.RE
-.RS
-.IP "[ - BRACKET EXPRESSION"
-The left bracket opens a bracket expression. The question mark and asterisk have
-no special meaning in a bracket expression. Each bracket expression ends by the
-right bracket and matches exactly one character. Some examples follow:
-
-\fB[a-zA-Z0\-9]\fP or \fB[f\-gF\-G]\fP \- character interval
-
-\fB[abc]\fP - character enumeration
-
-\fB[^abc]\fP or \fB[!abc]\fP - negation
-
-\fB[[:\fP\fIname\fP\fB:]]\fP class expression. Supported classes are
-\fBalnum\fP,\fBlower\fP, \fBspace\fP, \fBalpha\fP, \fBdigit\fP, \fBprint\fP,
-\fBupper\fP, \fBblank\fP, \fBgraph\fP, \fBxdigit\fP.
-
-\fB[][-!^]\fP - special case \- matches only '\-', ']', '[', '!' or '^'. These
-characters have no special purpose.
-
-\fB[\\[\\]\\\\]\fP - escape syntax. Matches '[', ']' or '\\'.
-
-Using the rules above, a file name pattern can be constructed:
-
-\&ftp://example.com/some/path/\fB[a-z[:upper:]\\\\].jpeg\fP
-.RE
-.PP
-(This was added in 7.21.0)
+Transfer multiple files according to a file name pattern. See \fICURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH(3)\fP
 .SH CALLBACK OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBsize_t function( char *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userdata);\fP
-This function gets called by libcurl as soon as there is data received that
-needs to be saved. The size of the data pointed to by \fIptr\fP is \fIsize\fP
-multiplied with \fInmemb\fP, it will not be zero terminated. Return the number
-of bytes actually taken care of. If that amount differs from the amount passed
-to your function, it'll signal an error to the library. This will abort the
-transfer and return \fICURLE_WRITE_ERROR\fP.
-
-From 7.18.0, the function can return CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE which then will
-cause writing to this connection to become paused. See
-\fIcurl_easy_pause(3)\fP for further details.
-
-This function may be called with zero bytes data if the transferred file is
-empty.
-
-Set this option to NULL to get the internal default function. The internal
-default function will write the data to the FILE * given with
-\fICURLOPT_WRITEDATA\fP.
-
-Set the \fIuserdata\fP argument with the \fICURLOPT_WRITEDATA\fP option.
-
-The callback function will be passed as much data as possible in all invokes,
-but you cannot possibly make any assumptions. It may be one byte, it may be
-thousands. The maximum amount of body data that can be passed to the write
-callback is defined in the curl.h header file: CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE (the usual
-default is 16K). If you however have \fICURLOPT_HEADER\fP set, which sends
-header data to the write callback, you can get up to
-\fICURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER\fP bytes of header data passed into it. This usually
-means 100K.
+Callback for writing data. See \fICURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_WRITEDATA
-Data pointer to pass to the file write function. If you use the
-\fICURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION\fP option, this is the pointer you'll get as
-input. If you don't use a callback, you must pass a 'FILE *' (cast
-to 'void *') as libcurl will pass this to fwrite() when writing data.
-By default, the value of this parameter is unspecified.
-
-The internal \fICURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION\fP will write the data to the FILE *
-given with this option, or to stdout if this option hasn't been set.
-
-If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you \fBMUST\fP use the
-\fICURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION\fP if you set this option or you will experience
-crashes.
-
-This option is also known with the older name \fICURLOPT_FILE\fP, the name
-\fICURLOPT_WRITEDATA\fP was introduced in 7.9.7.
+Data pointer to pass to the write callback. See \fICURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_READFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBsize_t function( void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userdata);\fP
-This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it needs to read data in order
-to send it to the peer. The data area pointed at by the pointer \fIptr\fP may
-be filled with at most \fIsize\fP multiplied with \fInmemb\fP number of
-bytes. Your function must return the actual number of bytes that you stored in
-that memory area. Returning 0 will signal end-of-file to the library and cause
-it to stop the current transfer.
-
-If you stop the current transfer by returning 0 "pre-maturely" (i.e before the
-server expected it, like when you've said you will upload N bytes and you
-upload less than N bytes), you may experience that the server "hangs" waiting
-for the rest of the data that won't come.
-
-The read callback may return \fICURL_READFUNC_ABORT\fP to stop the current
-operation immediately, resulting in a \fICURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK\fP error
-code from the transfer (Added in 7.12.1)
-
-From 7.18.0, the function can return CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE which then will cause
-reading from this connection to become paused. See \fIcurl_easy_pause(3)\fP
-for further details.
-
-\fBBugs\fP: when doing TFTP uploads, you must return the exact amount of data
-that the callback wants, or it will be considered the final packet by the
-server end and the transfer will end there.
-
-If you set this callback pointer to NULL, or don't set it at all, the default
-internal read function will be used. It is doing an fread() on the FILE *
-userdata set with \fICURLOPT_READDATA\fP.
+Callback for reading data. See \fICURLOPT_READFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_READDATA
-Data pointer to pass to the file read function. If you use the
-\fICURLOPT_READFUNCTION\fP option, this is the pointer you'll get as input. If
-you don't specify a read callback but instead rely on the default internal
-read function, this data must be a valid readable FILE * (cast to 'void *').
-
-If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST use a
-\fICURLOPT_READFUNCTION\fP if you set this option.
-
-This option was also known by the older name \fICURLOPT_INFILE\fP, the name
-\fICURLOPT_READDATA\fP was introduced in 7.9.7.
+Data pointer to pass to the read callback. See \fICURLOPT_READDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_IOCTLFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBcurlioerr function(CURL *handle, int cmd, void *clientp);\fP. This function
-gets called by libcurl when something special I/O-related needs to be done
-that the library can't do by itself. For now, rewinding the read data stream
-is the only action it can request. The rewinding of the read data stream may
-be necessary when doing a HTTP PUT or POST with a multi-pass authentication
-method. By default, this parameter is set to NULL.  (Option added in 7.12.3).
-
-Use \fICURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION\fP instead to provide seeking! If
-\fICURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION\fP is set, this parameter will be ignored when seeking.
+Callback for I/O operations. See \fICURLOPT_IOCTLFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_IOCTLDATA
-Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the 3rd
-argument in the ioctl callback set with \fICURLOPT_IOCTLFUNCTION\fP.
-By default, the value of this parameter is unspecified.  (Option added in
-7.12.3)
+Data pointer to pass to the i/o callback. See \fICURLOPT_IOCTLDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype: \fBint
-function(void *instream, curl_off_t offset, int origin);\fP This function gets
-called by libcurl to seek to a certain position in the input stream and can be
-used to fast forward a file in a resumed upload (instead of reading all
-uploaded bytes with the normal read function/callback). It is also called to
-rewind a stream when doing a HTTP PUT or POST with a multi-pass authentication
-method. The function shall work like "fseek" or "lseek" and accepted SEEK_SET,
-SEEK_CUR and SEEK_END as argument for origin, although libcurl currently only
-passes SEEK_SET. The callback must return 0 (CURL_SEEKFUNC_OK) on success, 1
-(CURL_SEEKFUNC_FAIL) to cause the upload operation to fail or 2
-(CURL_SEEKFUNC_CANTSEEK) to indicate that while the seek failed, libcurl is
-free to work around the problem if possible. The latter can sometimes be done
-by instead reading from the input or similar.
-
-By default, this parameter is unset.
-
-If you forward the input arguments directly to "fseek" or "lseek", note that
-the data type for \fIoffset\fP is not the same as defined for curl_off_t on
-many systems! (Option added in 7.18.0)
+Callback for seek operations. See \fICURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SEEKDATA
-Data pointer to pass to the file seek function. If you use the
-\fICURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION\fP option, this is the pointer you'll get as input. If
-you don't specify a seek callback, NULL is passed. (Option added in 7.18.0)
+Data pointer to pass to the seek callback. See \fICURLOPT_SEEKDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype: \fBint
-function(void *clientp, curl_socket_t curlfd, curlsocktype purpose);\fP. By
-default, this parameter is unset. If set, this
-function gets called by libcurl after the socket() call but before the
-connect() call. The callback's \fIpurpose\fP argument identifies the exact
-purpose for this particular socket:
-
-\fICURLSOCKTYPE_IPCXN\fP for actively created connections or since 7.28.0
-\fICURLSOCKTYPE_ACCEPT\fP for FTP when the connection was setup with PORT/EPSV
-(in earlier versions these sockets weren't passed to this callback).
-
-Future versions of libcurl may support more purposes. It passes the newly
-created socket descriptor so additional setsockopt() calls can be done at the
-user's discretion.  Return 0 (zero) from the callback on success. Return 1
-from the callback function to signal an unrecoverable error to the library and
-it will close the socket and return \fICURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT\fP.  (Option
-added in 7.16.0)
-
-Added in 7.21.5, the callback function may return
-\fICURL_SOCKOPT_ALREADY_CONNECTED\fP, which tells libcurl that the socket is
-in fact already connected and then libcurl will not attempt to connect it.
+Callback for sockopt operations. See \fICURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SOCKOPTDATA
-Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the first
-argument in the sockopt callback set with \fICURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION\fP.
-The default value of this parameter is unspecified.
-(Option added in 7.16.0)
+Data pointer to pass to the sockopt callback. See \fICURLOPT_SOCKOPTDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBcurl_socket_t function(void *clientp, curlsocktype purpose, struct
-curl_sockaddr *address);\fP. This function gets called by libcurl instead of
-the \fIsocket(2)\fP call. The callback's \fIpurpose\fP argument identifies the
-exact purpose for this particular socket: \fICURLSOCKTYPE_IPCXN\fP is for IP
-based connections. Future versions of libcurl may support more purposes. It
-passes the resolved peer address as a \fIaddress\fP argument so the callback
-can modify the address or refuse to connect at all. The callback function
-should return the socket or \fICURL_SOCKET_BAD\fP in case no connection could
-be established or another error was detected. Any additional
-\fIsetsockopt(2)\fP calls can be done on the socket at the user's discretion.
-\fICURL_SOCKET_BAD\fP return value from the callback function will signal an
-unrecoverable error to the library and it will return
-\fICURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT\fP.  This return code can be used for IP address
-blacklisting.  The default behavior is:
-.nf
-   return socket(addr->family, addr->socktype, addr->protocol);
-.fi
-(Option added in 7.17.1.)
+Callback for socket creation. See \fICURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETDATA
-Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the first
-argument in the opensocket callback set with \fICURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION\fP.
-The default value of this parameter is unspecified.
-(Option added in 7.17.1.)
+Data pointer to pass to the open socket callback. See \fICURLOPT_OPENSOCKETDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype: \fBint
-function(void *clientp, curl_socket_t item);\fP. This function gets called by
-libcurl instead of the \fIclose(3)\fP or \fIclosesocket(3)\fP call when
-sockets are closed (not for any other file descriptors). This is pretty much
-the reverse to the \fICURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION\fP option. Return 0 to signal
-success and 1 if there was an error.  (Option added in 7.21.7)
+Callback for closing socket. See \fICURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETDATA
-Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the first
-argument in the closesocket callback set with
-\fICURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETFUNCTION\fP.
-The default value of this parameter is unspecified.
-(Option added in 7.21.7)
+Data pointer to pass to the close socket callback. See \fICURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-
-\fBint function(void *clientp, double dltotal, double dlnow, double ultotal,
-double ulnow);\fP
-
-We encourage users to use \fICURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION\fP instead, if you can.
-
-This function gets called by libcurl instead of its internal equivalent with a
-frequent interval. While data is being transferred it will be called very
-frequently, and during slow periods like when nothing is being transferred it
-can slow down to about one call per second.
-
-\fIclientp\fP is the pointer set with \fICURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA\fP, it is not
-actually used by libcurl but is only passed along from the application to the
-callback.
-
-The callback gets told how much data libcurl will transfer and has
-transferred, in number of bytes. \fIdltotal\fP is the total number of bytes
-libcurl expects to download in this transfer. \fIdlnow\fP is the number of
-bytes downloaded so far. \fIultotal\fP is the total number of bytes libcurl
-expects to upload in this transfer. \fIulnow\fP is the number of bytes
-uploaded so far.
-
-Unknown/unused argument values passed to the callback will be set to zero
-(like if you only download data, the upload size will remain 0). Many times
-the callback will be called one or more times first, before it knows the data
-sizes so a program must be made to handle that.
-
-Returning a non-zero value from this callback will cause libcurl to abort the
-transfer and return \fICURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK\fP.
-
-If you transfer data with the multi interface, this function will not be
-called during periods of idleness unless you call the appropriate libcurl
-function that performs transfers.
-
-\fICURLOPT_NOPROGRESS\fP must be set to 0 to make this function actually
-get called.
-.IP CURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-
-.nf
-\fBint function(void *clientp, curl_off_t dltotal, curl_off_t dlnow,
-                curl_off_t ultotal, curl_off_t ulnow);\fP
-.fi
-
-This function gets called by libcurl instead of its internal equivalent with a
-frequent interval. While data is being transferred it will be called very
-frequently, and during slow periods like when nothing is being transferred it
-can slow down to about one call per second.
-
-\fIclientp\fP is the pointer set with \fICURLOPT_XFERINFODATA\fP, it is only
-passed along from the application to the callback.
-
-The callback gets told how much data libcurl will transfer and has
-transferred, in number of bytes. \fIdltotal\fP is the total number of bytes
-libcurl expects to download in this transfer. \fIdlnow\fP is the number of
-bytes downloaded so far. \fIultotal\fP is the total number of bytes libcurl
-expects to upload in this transfer. \fIulnow\fP is the number of bytes
-uploaded so far.
-
-Unknown/unused argument values passed to the callback will be set to zero
-(like if you only download data, the upload size will remain 0). Many times
-the callback will be called one or more times first, before it knows the data
-sizes so a program must be made to handle that.
-
-Returning a non-zero value from this callback will cause libcurl to abort the

-function that performs transfers.
-
-\fICURLOPT_NOPROGRESS\fP must be set to 0 to make this function actually

+OBSOLETE callback for progress meter. See \fICURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA
-Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the first
-argument in the progress callback set with \fICURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION\fP.
-The default value of this parameter is unspecified.
+Data pointer to pass to the progress meter callback. See \fICURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA(3)\fP
+.IP CURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION
+Callback for progress meter. See \fICURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_XFERINFODATA
-Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the first
-argument in the progress callback set with \fICURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION\fP.
-The default value of this parameter is unspecified. This option is an alias
-for CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA. (Added in 7.32.0)
+Data pointer to pass to the progress meter callback. See \fICURLOPT_XFERINFODATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBsize_t function( void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void
-*userdata);\fP. This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has
-received header data. The header callback will be called once for each header
-and only complete header lines are passed on to the callback. Parsing headers
-is very easy using this. The size of the data pointed to by \fIptr\fP is
-\fIsize\fP multiplied with \fInmemb\fP. Do not assume that the header line is
-zero terminated! The pointer named \fIuserdata\fP is the one you set with the
-\fICURLOPT_WRITEHEADER\fP option. The callback function must return the number
-of bytes actually taken care of. If that amount differs from the amount passed
-to your function, it'll signal an error to the library. This will abort the
-transfer and return \fICURL_WRITE_ERROR\fP.
-
-A complete HTTP header that is passed to this function can be up to
-\fICURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER\fP (100K) bytes.
-
-If this option is not set, or if it is set to NULL, but
-\fICURLOPT_HEADERDATA\fP (\fICURLOPT_WRITEHEADER\fP) is set to anything but
-NULL, the function used to accept response data will be used instead. That is,
-it will be the function specified with \fICURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION\fP, or if it
-is not specified or NULL - the default, stream-writing function.
-
-It's important to note that the callback will be invoked for the headers of
-all responses received after initiating a request and not just the final
-response. This includes all responses which occur during authentication
-negotiation. If you need to operate on only the headers from the final
-response, you will need to collect headers in the callback yourself and use
-HTTP status lines, for example, to delimit response boundaries.
-
-When a server sends a chunked encoded transfer, it may contain a trailer. That
-trailer is identical to a HTTP header and if such a trailer is received it is
-passed to the application using this callback as well. There are several ways
-to detect it being a trailer and not an ordinary header: 1) it comes after the
-response-body. 2) it comes after the final header line (CR LF) 3) a Trailer:
-header among the regular response-headers mention what header(s) to expect in
-the trailer.
-
-For non-HTTP protocols like FTP, POP3, IMAP and SMTP this function will get
-called with the server responses to the commands that libcurl sends.
-.IP CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER
-(This option is also known as \fBCURLOPT_HEADERDATA\fP) Pass a pointer to be
-used to write the header part of the received data to. If you don't use
-\fICURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION\fP or \fICURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION\fP to take care of
-the writing, this must be a valid FILE * as the internal default will then be
-a plain fwrite(). See also the \fICURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION\fP option above on
-how to set a custom get-all-headers callback.
+Callback for writing received headers. See \fICURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION(3)\fP
+.IP CURLOPT_HEADERDATA
+Data pointer to pass to the header callback. See \fICURLOPT_HEADERDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype: \fBint
-curl_debug_callback (CURL *, curl_infotype, char *, size_t, void *);\fP
-\fICURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION\fP replaces the standard debug function used when
-\fICURLOPT_VERBOSE \fP is in effect. This callback receives debug information,
-as specified with the \fBcurl_infotype\fP argument. This function must return
-0.  The data pointed to by the char * passed to this function WILL NOT be zero
-terminated, but will be exactly of the size as told by the size_t argument.
-
-Available curl_infotype values:
-.RS
-.IP CURLINFO_TEXT
-The data is informational text.
-.IP CURLINFO_HEADER_IN
-The data is header (or header-like) data received from the peer.
-.IP CURLINFO_HEADER_OUT
-The data is header (or header-like) data sent to the peer.
-.IP CURLINFO_DATA_IN
-The data is protocol data received from the peer.
-.IP CURLINFO_DATA_OUT
-The data is protocol data sent to the peer.
-.IP CURLINFO_SSL_DATA_OUT
-The data is SSL/TLS (binary) data sent to the peer.
-.IP CURLINFO_SSL_DATA_IN
-The data is SSL/TLS (binary) data received from the peer.
-.RE
+Callback for debug information. See \fICURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_DEBUGDATA
-Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed in to your
-\fICURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION\fP in the last void * argument. This pointer is not
-used by libcurl, it is only passed to the callback.
+Data pointer to pass to the debug callback. See \fICURLOPT_DEBUGDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION
-This option does only function for libcurl powered by OpenSSL. If libcurl was
-built against another SSL library, this functionality is absent.
-
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBCURLcode sslctxfun(CURL *curl, void *sslctx, void *parm);\fP This function
-gets called by libcurl just before the initialization of a SSL connection
-after having processed all other SSL related options to give a last chance to
-an application to modify the behaviour of openssl's ssl initialization. The
-\fIsslctx\fP parameter is actually a pointer to an openssl \fISSL_CTX\fP. If
-an error is returned no attempt to establish a connection is made and the
-perform operation will return the error code from this callback function.  Set
-the \fIparm\fP argument with the \fICURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA\fP option. This
-option was introduced in 7.11.0.
-
-This function will get called on all new connections made to a server, during
-the SSL negotiation. The SSL_CTX pointer will be a new one every time.
-
-To use this properly, a non-trivial amount of knowledge of the openssl
-libraries is necessary. For example, using this function allows you to use
-openssl callbacks to add additional validation code for certificates, and even
-to change the actual URI of a HTTPS request (example used in the lib509 test
-case).  See also the example section for a replacement of the key, certificate
-and trust file settings.
+Callback for SSL CTX logic. See \fICURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA
-Data pointer to pass to the ssl context callback set by the option
-\fICURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION\fP, this is the pointer you'll get as third
-parameter, otherwise \fBNULL\fP. (Added in 7.11.0)
+Data pointer to pass to the ssl context callback. See \fICURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CONV_TO_NETWORK_FUNCTION
+Callback for code base conversion. See \fICURLOPT_CONV_TO_NETWORK_FUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CONV_FROM_NETWORK_FUNCTION
+Callback for code base conversion. See \fICURLOPT_CONV_FROM_NETWORK_FUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CONV_FROM_UTF8_FUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBCURLcode function(char *ptr, size_t length);\fP
-
-These three options apply to non-ASCII platforms only.  They are available
-only if \fBCURL_DOES_CONVERSIONS\fP was defined when libcurl was built. When
-this is the case, \fIcurl_version_info(3)\fP will return the CURL_VERSION_CONV
-feature bit set.
-
-The data to be converted is in a buffer pointed to by the ptr parameter.  The
-amount of data to convert is indicated by the length parameter.  The converted
-data overlays the input data in the buffer pointed to by the ptr parameter.
-CURLE_OK should be returned upon successful conversion.  A CURLcode return
-value defined by curl.h, such as CURLE_CONV_FAILED, should be returned if an
-error was encountered.
-
-\fBCURLOPT_CONV_TO_NETWORK_FUNCTION\fP and
-\fBCURLOPT_CONV_FROM_NETWORK_FUNCTION\fP convert between the host encoding and
-the network encoding.  They are used when commands or ASCII data are
-sent/received over the network.
-
-\fBCURLOPT_CONV_FROM_UTF8_FUNCTION\fP is called to convert from UTF8 into the
-host encoding.  It is required only for SSL processing.
-
-If you set a callback pointer to NULL, or don't set it at all, the built-in
-libcurl iconv functions will be used.  If HAVE_ICONV was not defined when
-libcurl was built, and no callback has been established, conversion will
-return the CURLE_CONV_REQD error code.
-
-If HAVE_ICONV is defined, CURL_ICONV_CODESET_OF_HOST must also be defined.
-For example:
-
- \&#define CURL_ICONV_CODESET_OF_HOST "IBM-1047"
-
-The iconv code in libcurl will default the network and UTF8 codeset names as
-follows:
-
- \&#define CURL_ICONV_CODESET_OF_NETWORK "ISO8859-1"
-
- \&#define CURL_ICONV_CODESET_FOR_UTF8   "UTF-8"
-
-You will need to override these definitions if they are different on your
-system.
+Callback for code base conversion. See \fICURLOPT_CONV_FROM_UTF8_FUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_INTERLEAVEFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBsize_t function( void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void
-*userdata)\fP. This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received
-interleaved RTP data. This function gets called for each $ block and therefore
-contains exactly one upper-layer protocol unit (e.g.  one RTP packet). Curl
-writes the interleaved header as well as the included data for each call. The
-first byte is always an ASCII dollar sign. The dollar sign is followed by a
-one byte channel identifier and then a 2 byte integer length in network byte
-order. See \fIRFC2326 Section 10.12\fP for more information on how RTP
-interleaving behaves. If unset or set to NULL, curl will use the default write
-function.
-
-Interleaved RTP poses some challenges for the client application. Since the
-stream data is sharing the RTSP control connection, it is critical to service
-the RTP in a timely fashion. If the RTP data is not handled quickly,
-subsequent response processing may become unreasonably delayed and the
-connection may close. The application may use \fICURL_RTSPREQ_RECEIVE\fP to
-service RTP data when no requests are desired. If the application makes a
-request, (e.g.  \fICURL_RTSPREQ_PAUSE\fP) then the response handler will
-process any pending RTP data before marking the request as finished.  (Added
-in 7.20.0)
+Callback for RTSP interleaved data. See \fICURLOPT_INTERLEAVEFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_INTERLEAVEDATA
-This is the userdata pointer that will be passed to
-\fICURLOPT_INTERLEAVEFUNCTION\fP when interleaved RTP data is received. (Added
-in 7.20.0)
+Data pointer to pass to the interleave callback. See \fICURLOPT_INTERLEAVEDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBlong function (const void *transfer_info, void *ptr, int remains)\fP. This
-function gets called by libcurl before a part of the stream is going to be
-transferred (if the transfer supports chunks).
-
-This callback makes sense only when using the \fICURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH\fP
-option for now.
-
-The target of transfer_info parameter is a "feature depended" structure. For
-the FTP wildcard download, the target is curl_fileinfo structure (see
-\fIcurl/curl.h\fP).  The parameter ptr is a pointer given by
-\fICURLOPT_CHUNK_DATA\fP. The parameter remains contains number of chunks
-remaining per the transfer. If the feature is not available, the parameter has
-zero value.
-
-Return \fICURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_OK\fP if everything is fine,
-\fICURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP\fP if you want to skip the concrete chunk or
-\fICURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_FAIL\fP to tell libcurl to stop if some error occurred.
-(This was added in 7.21.0)
+Callback for wildcard download start of chunk. See \fICURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CHUNK_END_FUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype:
-\fBlong function(void *ptr)\fP. This function gets called by libcurl as soon
-as a part of the stream has been transferred (or skipped).
-
-Return \fICURL_CHUNK_END_FUNC_OK\fP if everything is fine or
-\fBCURL_CHUNK_END_FUNC_FAIL\fP to tell the lib to stop if some error occurred.
-(This was added in 7.21.0)
+Callback for wildcard download end of chunk. See \fICURLOPT_CHUNK_END_FUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CHUNK_DATA
-Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the ptr
-argument to the \fICURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNTION\fP and \fICURL_CHUNK_END_FUNTION\fP.
-(This was added in 7.21.0)
+Data pointer to pass to the chunk callbacks. See \fICURLOPT_CHUNK_DATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FNMATCH_FUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype: \fBint
-function(void *ptr, const char *pattern, const char *string)\fP prototype (see
-\fIcurl/curl.h\fP). It is used internally for the wildcard matching feature.
-
-Return \fICURL_FNMATCHFUNC_MATCH\fP if pattern matches the string,
-\fICURL_FNMATCHFUNC_NOMATCH\fP if not or \fICURL_FNMATCHFUNC_FAIL\fP if an
-error occurred.  (This was added in 7.21.0)
+Callback for wildcard matching. See \fICURLOPT_FNMATCH_FUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FNMATCH_DATA
-Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and passed as the ptr argument
-to the \fICURL_FNMATCH_FUNCTION\fP. (This was added in 7.21.0)
+Data pointer to pass to the fnmatch callback. See \fICURLOPT_FNMATCH_DATA(3)\fP
 .SH ERROR OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER
-Pass a char * to a buffer that the libcurl may store human readable error
-messages in. This may be more helpful than just the return code from
-\fIcurl_easy_perform\fP. The buffer must be at least CURL_ERROR_SIZE big.
-Although this argument is a 'char *', it does not describe an input string.
-Therefore the (probably undefined) contents of the buffer is NOT copied by the
-library. You must keep the associated storage available until libcurl no
-longer needs it. Failing to do so will cause very odd behavior or even
-crashes. libcurl will need it until you call \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP or you
-set the same option again to use a different pointer.
-
-Use \fICURLOPT_VERBOSE\fP and \fICURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION\fP to better
-debug/trace why errors happen.
-
-If the library does not return an error, the buffer may not have been
-touched. Do not rely on the contents in those cases.
-
+Error message buffer. See \fICURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_STDERR
-Pass a FILE * as parameter. Tell libcurl to use this stream instead of stderr
-when showing the progress meter and displaying \fICURLOPT_VERBOSE\fP data.
+stderr replacement stream. See \fICURLOPT_STDERR(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FAILONERROR
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to fail silently if the HTTP code
-returned is equal to or larger than 400. The default action would be to return
-the page normally, ignoring that code.
-
-This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-successful
-response codes will slip through, especially when authentication is involved
-(response codes 401 and 407).
-
-You might get some amounts of headers transferred before this situation is
-detected, like when a "100-continue" is received as a response to a
-POST/PUT and a 401 or 407 is received immediately afterwards.
+Fail on HTTP 4xx errors. \fICURLOPT_FAILONERROR(3)\fP
 .SH NETWORK OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_URL
-Pass in a pointer to the actual URL to deal with. The parameter should be a
-char * to a zero terminated string which must be URL-encoded in the following
-format:
-
-scheme://host:port/path
-
-For a greater explanation of the format please see RFC3986.
-
-If the given URL lacks the scheme (such as "http://" or "ftp://" etc) then
-libcurl will attempt to resolve the protocol based on one of the following
-given host names:
-
-HTTP, FTP, DICT, LDAP, IMAP, POP3 or SMTP
-
-(POP3 and SMTP added in 7.31.0)
-
-Should the protocol, either that specified by the scheme or deduced by libcurl
-from the host name, not be supported by libcurl then
-(\fICURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL\fP) will be returned from either the
-\fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP or \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP functions when you
-call them. Use \fIcurl_version_info(3)\fP for detailed information of which
-protocols are supported by the build of libcurl you are using.
-
-The host part of the URL contains the address of the server that you want to
-connect to. This can be the fully qualified domain name of the server, the
-local network name of the machine on your network or the IP address of the
-server or machine represented by either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. For example:
-
-http://www.example.com/
-
-http://hostname/
-
-http://192.168.0.1/
-
-http://[2001:1890:1112:1::20]/
-
-It is also possible to specify the user name, password and any supported login
-options as part of the host, for the following protocols, when connecting to
-servers that require authentication:
-
-http://user:password@www.example.com
-
-ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com
-
-imap://user:password;options@mail.example.com
-
-pop3://user:password;options@mail.example.com
-
-smtp://user:password;options@mail.example.com
-
-At present only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options as part of the host.
-For more information about the login options in URL syntax please see RFC2384,
-RFC5092 and IETF draft draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt (Added in 7.31.0).
-
-The port is optional and when not specified libcurl will use the default port
-based on the determined or specified protocol: 80 for HTTP, 21 for FTP and 25
-for SMTP, etc. The following examples show how to specify the port:
-
-http://www.example.com:8080/ - This will connect to a web server using port
-8080 rather than 80.
-
-smtp://mail.example.com:587/ - This will connect to a SMTP server on the
-alternative mail port.
-
-The path part of the URL is protocol specific and whilst some examples are
-given below this list is not conclusive:
-
-.B HTTP
-
-The path part of a HTTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what
-directory. If the directory is not specified then the web server's root
-directory is used. If the file is omitted then the default document will be
-retrieved for either the directory specified or the root directory. The
-exact resource returned for each URL is entirely dependent on the server's
-configuration.
-
-http://www.example.com - This gets the main page from the web server.
-
-http://www.example.com/index.html - This returns the main page by explicitly
-requesting it.
-
-http://www.example.com/contactus/ - This returns the default document from
-the contactus directory.
-
-.B FTP
-
-The path part of an FTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what
-directory. If the file part is omitted then libcurl downloads the directory
-listing for the directory specified. If the directory is omitted then
-the directory listing for the root / home directory will be returned.
-
-ftp://ftp.example.com - This retrieves the directory listing for the root
-directory.
-
-ftp://ftp.example.com/readme.txt - This downloads the file readme.txt from the
-root directory.
-
-ftp://ftp.example.com/libcurl/readme.txt - This downloads readme.txt from the
-libcurl directory.
-
-ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com/readme.txt - This retrieves the readme.txt
-file from the user's home directory. When a username and password is
-specified, everything that is specified in the path part is relative to the
-user's home directory. To retrieve files from the root directory or a
-directory underneath the root directory then the absolute path must be
-specified by prepending an additional forward slash to the beginning of the
-path.
-
-ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com//readme.txt - This retrieves the readme.txt
-from the root directory when logging in as a specified user.
-
-.B SMTP
-
-The path part of a SMTP request specifies the host name to present during
-communication with the mail server. If the path is omitted then libcurl will
-attempt to resolve the local computer's host name. However, this may not
-return the fully qualified domain name that is required by some mail servers
-and specifying this path allows you to set an alternative name, such as
-your machine's fully qualified domain name, which you might have obtained
-from an external function such as gethostname or getaddrinfo.
-
-smtp://mail.example.com - This connects to the mail server at example.com and
-sends your local computer's host name in the HELO / EHLO command.
-
-smtp://mail.example.com/client.example.com - This will send client.example.com in
-the HELO / EHLO command to the mail server at example.com.
-
-.B POP3
-
-The path part of a POP3 request specifies the message ID to retrieve. If the
-ID is not specified then a list of waiting messages is returned instead.
-
-pop3://user:password@mail.example.com - This lists the available messages for
-the user
-
-pop3://user:password@mail.example.com/1 - This retrieves the first message for
-the user
-
-.B IMAP
-
-The path part of an IMAP request not only specifies the mailbox to list (Added
-in 7.30.0) or select, but can also be used to check the UIDVALIDITY of the
-mailbox, to specify the UID, SECTION (Added in 7.30.0) and PARTIAL octets
-(Added in 7.37.0) of the message to fetch and to specify what nessages to
-search for (Added in 7.37.0).
-
-imap://user:password@mail.example.com - Performs a top level folder list
-
-imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX - Performs a folder list on the
-user's inbox
-
-imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX/;UID=1 - Selects the user's inbox
-and fetches message 1
-
-imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX;UIDVALIDITY=50/;UID=2 - Selects
-the user's inbox, checks the UIDVALIDITY of the mailbox is 50 and fetches
-message 2 if it is
-
-imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX/;UID=3/;SECTION=TEXT - Selects the
-user's inbox and fetches the text portial of message 3
-
-imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX/;UID=4/;PARTIAL=0.1024 - Selects
-the user's inbox and fetches the first 1024 octets of message 4
-
-imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX?NEW - Selects the user's inbox and
-checks for NEW messages
-
-imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX?SUBJECT%20shadows - Selects the
-user's inbox and searches for messages containing "shadows" in the subject
-line
-
-For more information about the individual components of an IMAP URL please
-see RFC5092.
-
-.B SCP
-
-The path part of a SCP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what
-directory. The file part may not be omitted. The file is taken as an absolute
-path from the root directory on the server. To specify a path relative to
-the user's home directory on the server, prepend ~/ to the path portion.
-If the user name is not embedded in the URL, it can be set with the
-\fICURLOPT_USERPWD\fP or \fBCURLOPT_USERNAME\fP option.
-
-scp://user@example.com/etc/issue - This specifies the file /etc/issue
-
-scp://example.com/~/my-file - This specifies the file my-file in the
-user's home directory on the server
-
-.B SFTP
-
-The path part of a SFTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what
-directory. If the file part is omitted then libcurl downloads the directory
-listing for the directory specified.  If the path ends in a / then a directory
-listing is returned instead of a file.  If the path is omitted entirely then
-the directory listing for the root / home directory will be returned.
-If the user name is not embedded in the URL, it can be set with the
-\fICURLOPT_USERPWD\fP or \fBCURLOPT_USERNAME\fP option.
-
-sftp://user:password@example.com/etc/issue - This specifies the file
-/etc/issue
-
-sftp://user@example.com/~/my-file - This specifies the file my-file in the
-user's home directory
-
-sftp://ssh.example.com/~/Documents/ - This requests a directory listing
-of the Documents directory under the user's home directory
-
-.B LDAP
-
-The path part of a LDAP request can be used to specify the: Distinguished
-Name, Attributes, Scope, Filter and Extension for a LDAP search. Each field
-is separated by a question mark and when that field is not required an empty
-string with the question mark separator should be included.
-
-ldap://ldap.example.com/o=My%20Organisation - This will perform a LDAP search
-with the DN as My Organisation.
-
-ldap://ldap.example.com/o=My%20Organisation?postalAddress - This will perform
-the same search but will only return postalAddress attributes.
-
-ldap://ldap.example.com/?rootDomainNamingContext - This specifies an empty DN
-and requests information about the rootDomainNamingContext attribute for an
-Active Directory server.
-
-For more information about the individual components of a LDAP URL please
-see RFC4516.
-
-.B RTMP
-
-There's no official URL spec for RTMP so libcurl uses the URL syntax supported
-by the underlying librtmp library. It has a syntax where it wants a
-traditional URL, followed by a space and a series of space-separated
-name=value pairs.
-
-While space is not typically a "legal" letter, libcurl accepts them. When a
-user wants to pass in a '#' (hash) character it will be treated as a fragment
-and get cut off by libcurl if provided literally. You will instead have to
-escape it by providing it as backslash and its ASCII value in hexadecimal:
-"\\23".
-
-.B NOTES
-
-Starting with version 7.20.0, the fragment part of the URI will not be sent as
-part of the path, which was previously the case.
-
-\fICURLOPT_URL\fP is the only option that \fBmust\fP be set before
-\fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP is called.
-
-\fICURLOPT_PROTOCOLS\fP can be used to limit what protocols libcurl will use
-for this transfer, independent of what libcurl has been compiled to
-support. That may be useful if you accept the URL from an external source and
-want to limit the accessibility.
+URL to work on. See \fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS
-Pass a long that holds a bitmask of CURLPROTO_* defines. If used, this bitmask
-limits what protocols libcurl may use in the transfer. This allows you to have
-a libcurl built to support a wide range of protocols but still limit specific
-transfers to only be allowed to use a subset of them. By default libcurl will
-accept all protocols it supports. See also
-\fICURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS\fP. (Added in 7.19.4)
+Allowed protocols. See \fICURLOPT_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS
-Pass a long that holds a bitmask of CURLPROTO_* defines. If used, this bitmask
-limits what protocols libcurl may use in a transfer that it follows to in a
-redirect when \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION\fP is enabled. This allows you to
-limit specific transfers to only be allowed to use a subset of protocols in
-redirections. By default libcurl will allow all protocols except for FILE and
-SCP. This is a difference compared to pre-7.19.4 versions which
-unconditionally would follow to all protocols supported. (Added in 7.19.4)
+Protocols to allow redirects to. See \fICURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXY
-Set HTTP proxy to use. The parameter should be a char * to a zero terminated
-string holding the host name or dotted IP address. To specify port number in
-this string, append :[port] to the end of the host name. The proxy string may
-be prefixed with [protocol]:// since any such prefix will be ignored. The
-proxy's port number may optionally be specified with the separate option
-\fICURLOPT_PROXYPORT\fP. If not specified, libcurl will default to using port
-1080 for proxies.
-
-When you tell the library to use a HTTP proxy, libcurl will transparently
-convert operations to HTTP even if you specify an FTP URL etc. This may have
-an impact on what other features of the library you can use, such as
-\fICURLOPT_QUOTE\fP and similar FTP specifics that don't work unless you
-tunnel through the HTTP proxy. Such tunneling is activated with
-\fICURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL\fP.
-
-libcurl respects the environment variables \fBhttp_proxy\fP, \fBftp_proxy\fP,
-\fBall_proxy\fP etc, if any of those are set. The \fICURLOPT_PROXY\fP option
-does however override any possibly set environment variables.
-
-Setting the proxy string to "" (an empty string) will explicitly disable the
-use of a proxy, even if there is an environment variable set for it.
-
-Since 7.14.1, the proxy host string given in environment variables can be
-specified the exact same way as the proxy can be set with \fICURLOPT_PROXY\fP,
-include protocol prefix (http://) and embedded user + password.
-
-Since 7.21.7, the proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to
-specify alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or
-socks5h:// (the last one to enable socks5 and asking the proxy to do the
-resolving, also known as CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME type) to request the
-specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified, http:// and all
-others will be treated as HTTP proxies.
+Proxy to use. See \fICURLOPT_PROXY(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXYPORT
-Pass a long with this option to set the proxy port to connect to unless it is
-specified in the proxy string \fICURLOPT_PROXY\fP.
+Proxy port to use. See \fICURLOPT_PROXYPORT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE
-Pass a long with this option to set type of the proxy. Available options for
-this are \fICURLPROXY_HTTP\fP, \fICURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0\fP (added in 7.19.4),
-\fICURLPROXY_SOCKS4\fP (added in 7.10), \fICURLPROXY_SOCKS5\fP,
-\fICURLPROXY_SOCKS4A\fP (added in 7.18.0) and \fICURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME\fP
-(added in 7.18.0). The HTTP type is default. (Added in 7.10)
-
-If you set \fBCURLOPT_PROXYTYPE\fP to \fICURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0\fP, it will only
-affect how libcurl speaks to a proxy when CONNECT is used. The HTTP version
-used for "regular" HTTP requests is instead controlled with
-\fICURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION\fP.
+Proxy type. See \fICURLOPT_PROXYTYPE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_NOPROXY
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string. The string consists of a comma
-separated list of host names that do not require a proxy to get reached, even
-if one is specified.  The only wildcard available is a single * character,
-which matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this
-list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the
-hostname itself. For example, example.com would match example.com,
-example.com:80, and www.example.com, but not www.notanexample.com or
-example.com.othertld.  (Added in 7.19.4)
+Filter out hosts from proxy use. \fICURLOPT_NOPROXY(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL
-Set the parameter to 1 to make the library tunnel all operations through a
-given HTTP proxy. There is a big difference between using a proxy and to
-tunnel through it. If you don't know what this means, you probably don't want
-this tunneling option.
+Tunnel through the HTTP proxy. \fICURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SOCKS5_GSSAPI_SERVICE
-Pass a char * as parameter to a string holding the name of the service. The
-default service name for a SOCKS5 server is rcmd/server-fqdn. This option
-allows you to change it. (Added in 7.19.4)
+Socks5 gassapi service name. \fICURLOPT_SOCKS5_GSSAPI_SERVICE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SOCKS5_GSSAPI_NEC
-Pass a long set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable. As part of the gssapi
-negotiation a protection mode is negotiated. The RFC1961 says in section
-4.3/4.4 it should be protected, but the NEC reference implementation does not.
-If enabled, this option allows the unprotected exchange of the protection mode
-negotiation. (Added in 7.19.4).
+Socks5 gssapi NEC mode. See \fICURLOPT_SOCKS5_GSSAPI_NEC(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_INTERFACE
-Pass a char * as parameter. This sets the interface name to use as outgoing
-network interface. The name can be an interface name, an IP address, or a host
-name.
-
-Starting with 7.24.0: If the parameter starts with "if!" then it is treated as
-only as interface name and no attempt will ever be named to do treat it as an
-IP address or to do name resolution on it.  If the parameter starts with
-\&"host!" it is treated as either an IP address or a hostname.  Hostnames are
-resolved synchronously.  Using the if! format is highly recommended when using
-the multi interfaces to avoid allowing the code to block.  If "if!" is
-specified but the parameter does not match an existing interface,
-CURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED is returned.
+Bind connection locally to this. See \fICURLOPT_INTERFACE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_LOCALPORT
-Pass a long. This sets the local port number of the socket used for
-connection. This can be used in combination with \fICURLOPT_INTERFACE\fP and
-you are recommended to use \fICURLOPT_LOCALPORTRANGE\fP as well when this is
-set. Valid port numbers are 1 - 65535. (Added in 7.15.2)
+Bind connection locally to this port. See \fICURLOPT_LOCALPORT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_LOCALPORTRANGE
-Pass a long. This is the number of attempts libcurl will make to find a
-working local port number. It starts with the given \fICURLOPT_LOCALPORT\fP
-and adds one to the number for each retry. Setting this to 1 or below will
-make libcurl do only one try for the exact port number. Port numbers by nature
-are scarce resources that will be busy at times so setting this value to
-something too low might cause unnecessary connection setup failures. (Added in
-7.15.2)
+Bind connection locally to port range. See \fICURLOPT_LOCALPORTRANGE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT
-Pass a long, this sets the timeout in seconds. Name resolves will be kept in
-memory for this number of seconds. Set to zero to completely disable
-caching, or set to -1 to make the cached entries remain forever. By default,
-libcurl caches this info for 60 seconds.
-
-The name resolve functions of various libc implementations don't re-read name
-server information unless explicitly told so (for example, by calling
-\fIres_init(3)\fP). This may cause libcurl to keep using the older server even
-if DHCP has updated the server info, and this may look like a DNS cache issue
-to the casual libcurl-app user.
+Timeout for DNS cache. See \fICURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE
-Pass a long. If the value is 1, it tells curl to use a global DNS cache
-that will survive between easy handle creations and deletions. This is not
-thread-safe and this will use a global variable.
-
-\fBWARNING:\fP this option is considered obsolete. Stop using it. Switch over
-to using the share interface instead! See \fICURLOPT_SHARE\fP and
-\fIcurl_share_init(3)\fP.
+OBSOLETE Enable global DNS cache. See \fICURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE
-Pass a long specifying your preferred size (in bytes) for the receive buffer
-in libcurl.  The main point of this would be that the write callback gets
-called more often and with smaller chunks. This is just treated as a request,
-not an order. You cannot be guaranteed to actually get the given size. (Added
-in 7.10)
-
-This size is by default set as big as possible (CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE), so it
-only makes sense to use this option if you want it smaller.
+Ask for smaller buffer size. See \fICURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PORT
-Pass a long specifying what remote port number to connect to, instead of the
-one specified in the URL or the default port for the used protocol.
+Port number to connect to. See \fICURLOPT_PORT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY
-Pass a long specifying whether the TCP_NODELAY option is to be set or cleared
-(1 = set, 0 = clear). The option is cleared by default. This will have no
-effect after the connection has been established.
-
-Setting this option will disable TCP's Nagle algorithm. The purpose of this
-algorithm is to try to minimize the number of small packets on the network
-(where "small packets" means TCP segments less than the Maximum Segment Size
-(MSS) for the network).
-
-Maximizing the amount of data sent per TCP segment is good because it
-amortizes the overhead of the send. However, in some cases (most notably
-telnet or rlogin) small segments may need to be sent without delay. This is
-less efficient than sending larger amounts of data at a time, and can
-contribute to congestion on the network if overdone.
+Disable the Nagle algorithm. See \fICURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_ADDRESS_SCOPE
-Pass a long specifying the scope_id value to use when connecting to IPv6
-link-local or site-local addresses. (Added in 7.19.0)
+IPv6 scope for local addresses. See \fICURLOPT_ADDRESS_SCOPE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE
-Pass a long. If set to 1, TCP keepalive probes will be sent. The delay and
-frequency of these probes can be controlled by the \fICURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE\fP
-and \fICURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL\fP options, provided the operating system supports
-them. Set to 0 (default behavior) to disable keepalive probes (Added in
-7.25.0).
+Enable TCP keep-alive. See \fICURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE
-Pass a long. Sets the delay, in seconds, that the operating system will wait
-while the connection is idle before sending keepalive probes. Not all operating
-systems support this option. (Added in 7.25.0)
+Idle time before sending keep-alive. See \fICURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL
-Pass a long. Sets the interval, in seconds, that the operating system will wait
-between sending keepalive probes. Not all operating systems support this
-option. (Added in 7.25.0)
+Interval between keep-alive probes. See \fICURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL(3)\fP
 .SH NAMES and PASSWORDS OPTIONS (Authentication)
 .IP CURLOPT_NETRC
-This parameter controls the preference of libcurl between using user names and
-passwords from your \fI~/.netrc\fP file, relative to user names and passwords
-in the URL supplied with \fICURLOPT_URL\fP.
-
-libcurl uses a user name (and supplied or prompted password) supplied with
-\fICURLOPT_USERPWD\fP in preference to any of the options controlled by this
-parameter.
-
-Pass a long, set to one of the values described below.
-.RS
-.IP CURL_NETRC_OPTIONAL
-The use of your \fI~/.netrc\fP file is optional, and information in the URL is
-to be preferred.  The file will be scanned for the host and user name (to
-find the password only) or for the host only, to find the first user name and
-password after that \fImachine\fP, which ever information is not specified in
-the URL.
-
-Undefined values of the option will have this effect.
-.IP CURL_NETRC_IGNORED
-The library will ignore the file and use only the information in the URL.
-
-This is the default.
-.IP CURL_NETRC_REQUIRED
-This value tells the library that use of the file is required, to ignore the
-information in the URL, and to search the file for the host only.
-.RE
-Only machine name, user name and password are taken into account
-(init macros and similar things aren't supported).
-
-libcurl does not verify that the file has the correct properties set (as the
-standard Unix ftp client does). It should only be readable by user.
+Enable .netrc parsing. See \fICURLOPT_NETRC(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_NETRC_FILE
-Pass a char * as parameter, pointing to a zero terminated string containing
-the full path name to the file you want libcurl to use as .netrc file. If this
-option is omitted, and \fICURLOPT_NETRC\fP is set, libcurl will attempt to
-find a .netrc file in the current user's home directory. (Added in 7.10.9)
+\&.netrc file name. See \fICURLOPT_NETRC_FILE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_USERPWD
-Pass a char * as parameter, pointing to a zero terminated login details string
-for the connection. The format of which is: [user name]:[password].
-
-When using NTLM, you can set the domain by prepending it to the user name and
-separating the domain and name with a forward (/) or backward slash (\\). Like
-this: "domain/user:password" or "domain\\user:password". Some HTTP servers (on
-Windows) support this style even for Basic authentication.
-
-When using HTTP and \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION\fP, libcurl might perform
-several requests to possibly different hosts. libcurl will only send this user
-and password information to hosts using the initial host name (unless
-\fICURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH\fP is set), so if libcurl follows locations to
-other hosts it will not send the user and password to those. This is enforced
-to prevent accidental information leakage.
-
-Use \fICURLOPT_HTTPAUTH\fP to specify the authentication method for HTTP based
-connections or \fICURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS\fP to control IMAP, POP3 and SMTP
-options.
-
-The user and password strings are not URL decoded, so there's no way to send
-in a user name containing a colon using this option. Use \fICURLOPT_USERNAME\fP
-for that, or include it in the URL.
+User and password. See \fICURLOPT_USERPWD(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should be [user name]:[password] to use for
-the connection to the HTTP proxy. Both the name and the password will be URL
-decoded before use, so to include for example a colon in the user name you
-should encode it as %3A.
-
-Use \fICURLOPT_PROXYAUTH\fP to specify the authentication method.
+Proxy user and password. See \fICURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_USERNAME
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should be pointing to the zero terminated
-user name to use for the transfer.
-
-\fBCURLOPT_USERNAME\fP sets the user name to be used in protocol
-authentication. You should not use this option together with the (older)
-CURLOPT_USERPWD option.
-
-To specify the password and login options, along with the user name, use the
-\fICURLOPT_PASSWORD\fP and \fICURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS\fP options. (Added in
-7.19.1)
+Username. See \fICURLOPT_USERNAME(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PASSWORD
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should be pointing to the zero terminated
-password to use for the transfer.
-
-The CURLOPT_PASSWORD option should be used in conjunction with the
-\fICURLOPT_USERNAME\fP option. (Added in 7.19.1)
+Password. See \fICURLOPT_PASSWORD(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS
-(Added in 7.34.0) Pass a char * as parameter, which should be pointing to the
-zero terminated options string to use for the transfer.
-
-At present only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more
-information about the login options please see RFC2384, RFC5092 and IETF draft
-draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt
-
-\fBCURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS\fP can be used to set protocol specific login options,
-such as the preferred authentication mechanism via "AUTH=NTLM" or "AUTH=*",
-and should be used in conjunction with the \fICURLOPT_USERNAME\fP option.
+Login options. See \fICURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXYUSERNAME
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should be pointing to the zero terminated
-user name to use for the transfer while connecting to Proxy.
-
-The CURLOPT_PROXYUSERNAME option should be used in same way as the
-\fICURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD\fP is used.  In comparison to
-\fICURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD\fP the CURLOPT_PROXYUSERNAME allows the username to
-contain a colon, like in the following example: "sip:user@example.com". The
-CURLOPT_PROXYUSERNAME option is an alternative way to set the user name while
-connecting to Proxy.  There is no meaning to use it together with the
-\fICURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD\fP option.
-
-In order to specify the password to be used in conjunction with the user name
-use the \fICURLOPT_PROXYPASSWORD\fP option.  (Added in 7.19.1)
+Proxy user name. See \fICURLOPT_PROXYUSERNAME(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXYPASSWORD
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should be pointing to the zero terminated
-password to use for the transfer while connecting to Proxy.
-
-The CURLOPT_PROXYPASSWORD option should be used in conjunction with
-the \fICURLOPT_PROXYUSERNAME\fP option. (Added in 7.19.1)
+Proxy password. See \fICURLOPT_PROXYPASSWORD(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH
-Pass a long as parameter, which is set to a bitmask, to tell libcurl which
-authentication method(s) you want it to use. The available bits are listed
-below. If more than one bit is set, libcurl will first query the site to see
-which authentication methods it supports and then pick the best one you allow
-it to use. For some methods, this will induce an extra network round-trip. Set
-the actual name and password with the \fICURLOPT_USERPWD\fP option or
-with the \fICURLOPT_USERNAME\fP and the \fICURLOPT_PASSWORD\fP options.
-(Added in 7.10.6)
-.RS
-.IP CURLAUTH_BASIC
-HTTP Basic authentication. This is the default choice, and the only method
-that is in wide-spread use and supported virtually everywhere. This sends
-the user name and password over the network in plain text, easily captured by
-others.
-.IP CURLAUTH_DIGEST
-HTTP Digest authentication.  Digest authentication is defined in RFC2617 and
-is a more secure way to do authentication over public networks than the
-regular old-fashioned Basic method.
-.IP CURLAUTH_DIGEST_IE
-HTTP Digest authentication with an IE flavor.  Digest authentication is
-defined in RFC2617 and is a more secure way to do authentication over public
-networks than the regular old-fashioned Basic method. The IE flavor is simply
-that libcurl will use a special "quirk" that IE is known to have used before
-version 7 and that some servers require the client to use. (This define was
-added in 7.19.3)
-.IP CURLAUTH_GSSNEGOTIATE
-HTTP GSS-Negotiate authentication. The GSS-Negotiate (also known as plain
-\&"Negotiate") method was designed by Microsoft and is used in their web
-applications. It is primarily meant as a support for Kerberos5 authentication
-but may also be used along with other authentication methods. For more
-information see IETF draft draft-brezak-spnego-http-04.txt.
-
-You need to build libcurl with a suitable GSS-API library for this to work.
-.IP CURLAUTH_NTLM
-HTTP NTLM authentication. A proprietary protocol invented and used by
-Microsoft. It uses a challenge-response and hash concept similar to Digest, to
-prevent the password from being eavesdropped.
-
-You need to build libcurl with either OpenSSL, GnuTLS or NSS support for this
-option to work, or build libcurl on Windows with SSPI support.
-.IP CURLAUTH_NTLM_WB
-NTLM delegating to winbind helper. Authentication is performed by a separate
-binary application that is executed when needed. The name of the application
-is specified at compile time but is typically /usr/bin/ntlm_auth
-(Added in 7.22.0)
-
-Note that libcurl will fork when necessary to run the winbind application and
-kill it when complete, calling waitpid() to await its exit when done. On POSIX
-operating systems, killing the process will cause a SIGCHLD signal to be
-raised (regardless of whether \fICURLOPT_NOSIGNAL\fP is set), which must be
-handled intelligently by the application. In particular, the application must
-not unconditionally call wait() in its SIGCHLD signal handler to avoid being
-subject to a race condition.  This behavior is subject to change in future
-versions of libcurl.
-.IP CURLAUTH_ANY
-This is a convenience macro that sets all bits and thus makes libcurl pick any
-it finds suitable. libcurl will automatically select the one it finds most
-secure.
-.IP CURLAUTH_ANYSAFE
-This is a convenience macro that sets all bits except Basic and thus makes
-libcurl pick any it finds suitable. libcurl will automatically select the one
-it finds most secure.
-.IP CURLAUTH_ONLY
-This is a meta symbol. Or this value together with a single specific auth
-value to force libcurl to probe for un-restricted auth and if not, only that
-single auth algorithm is acceptable. (Added in 7.21.3)

-.RS
-.IP CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_SRP
-TLS-SRP authentication. Secure Remote Password authentication for TLS is
-defined in RFC5054 and provides mutual authentication if both sides have a
-shared secret. To use TLS-SRP, you must also set the
-\fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME\fP and \fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD\fP options.

 .IP CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should point to the zero terminated username
-to use for the TLS authentication method specified with the
-\fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_TYPE\fP option. Requires that the
-\fICURLOPT_TLS_PASSWORD\fP option also be set. (Added in 7.21.4)
+TLS authentication user name. See \fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should point to the zero terminated password
-to use for the TLS authentication method specified with the
-\fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_TYPE\fP option. Requires that the
-\fICURLOPT_TLS_USERNAME\fP option also be set. (Added in 7.21.4)
+TLS authentication password. See \fICURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH
-Pass a long as parameter, which is set to a bitmask, to tell libcurl which
-authentication method(s) you want it to use for your proxy authentication.  If
-more than one bit is set, libcurl will first query the site to see what
-authentication methods it supports and then pick the best one you allow it to
-use. For some methods, this will induce an extra network round-trip. Set the
-actual name and password with the \fICURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD\fP option. The
-bitmask can be constructed by or'ing together the bits listed above for the
-\fICURLOPT_HTTPAUTH\fP option. \fICURLOPT_PROXYAUTH\fP was added in 7.10.7
+HTTP proxy authentication methods. See \fICURLOPT_PROXYAUTH(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SASL_IR
-Pass a long. If the value is 1, curl will send the initial response to the
-server in the first authentication packet in order to reduce the number of
-ping pong requests. Only applicable to supporting SASL authentication
-mechanisms and to the IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols. (Added in 7.31.0)
-
-Note: Whilst IMAP supports this option there is no need to explicitly set it,
-as libcurl can determine the feature itself when the server supports the
-SASL-IR CAPABILITY.
+Enable SASL initial response. See \fICURLOPT_SASL_IR(3)\fP

-automatically set the Referer: field in requests where it follows a Location:
-redirect.
+Automatically set Referer: header. See \fICURLOPT_AUTOREFERER(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING
-Sets the contents of the Accept-Encoding: header sent in a HTTP request, and
-enables decoding of a response when a Content-Encoding: header is received.
-Three encodings are supported: \fIidentity\fP, which does nothing,
-\fIdeflate\fP which requests the server to compress its response using the
-zlib algorithm, and \fIgzip\fP which requests the gzip algorithm.  If a
-zero-length string is set, then an Accept-Encoding: header containing all
-supported encodings is sent.
-
-This is a request, not an order; the server may or may not do it.  This option
-must be set (to any non-NULL value) or else any unsolicited encoding done by
-the server is ignored. See the special file lib/README.encoding for details.
-
-(This option was called CURLOPT_ENCODING before 7.21.6)
+Accept-Encoding and automatic decompressing data. See \fICURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING
-Adds a request for compressed Transfer Encoding in the outgoing HTTP
-request. If the server supports this and so desires, it can respond with the
-HTTP response sent using a compressed Transfer-Encoding that will be
-automatically uncompressed by libcurl on reception.
-
-Transfer-Encoding differs slightly from the Content-Encoding you ask for with
-\fBCURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING\fP in that a Transfer-Encoding is strictly meant to
-be for the transfer and thus MUST be decoded before the data arrives in the
-client. Traditionally, Transfer-Encoding has been much less used and supported
-by both HTTP clients and HTTP servers.
-
-(Added in 7.21.6)
+Request Transfer-Encoding. See \fICURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to follow any Location: header that the
-server sends as part of a HTTP header.
-
-This means that the library will re-send the same request on the new location
-and follow new Location: headers all the way until no more such headers are
-returned. \fICURLOPT_MAXREDIRS\fP can be used to limit the number of redirects
-libcurl will follow.
-
-Since 7.19.4, libcurl can limit what protocols it will automatically
-follow. The accepted protocols are set with \fICURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS\fP and
-it excludes the FILE protocol by default.
+Follow HTTP redirects. See \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library it can continue to send authentication
-(user+password) when following locations, even when hostname changed. This
-option is meaningful only when setting \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION\fP.
+Do not restrict auth to original host. \fICURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS
-Pass a long. The set number will be the redirection limit. If that many
-redirections have been followed, the next redirect will cause an error
-(\fICURLE_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS\fP). This option only makes sense if the
-\fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION\fP is used at the same time. Added in 7.15.1:
-Setting the limit to 0 will make libcurl refuse any redirect. Set it to -1 for
-an infinite number of redirects (which is the default)
+Maximum number of redirects to follow. See \fICURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_POSTREDIR
-Pass a bitmask to control how libcurl acts on redirects after POSTs that get a
-301, 302 or 303 response back.  A parameter with bit 0 set (value
-\fBCURL_REDIR_POST_301\fP) tells the library to respect RFC2616/10.3.2 and not
-convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection.
-Setting bit 1 (value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_302\fP) makes libcurl maintain the
-request method after a 302 redirect whilst setting bit 2 (value
-\fBCURL_REDIR_POST_303\fP) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a
-303 redirect. The value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_ALL\fP is a convenience define that
-sets all three bits.
-
-The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers, so the library does the
-conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a
-POST to remain a POST after such a redirection. This option is meaningful only
-when setting \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION\fP.  (Added in 7.17.1) (This option was
-known as CURLOPT_POST301 up to 7.19.0 as it only supported the 301 then)
+How to act on redirects after POST. See \fICURLOPT_POSTREDIR(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PUT
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to use HTTP PUT to transfer data. The
-data should be set with \fICURLOPT_READDATA\fP and \fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE\fP.
-
-This option is deprecated and starting with version 7.12.1 you should instead
-use \fICURLOPT_UPLOAD\fP.
+Issue a HTTP PUT request. See \fICURLOPT_PUT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_POST
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to do a regular HTTP post. This will
-also make the library use a "Content-Type:
-application/x-www-form-urlencoded" header. (This is by far the most commonly
-used POST method).
-
-Use one of \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP or \fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS\fP options to
-specify what data to post and \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE\fP or
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE\fP to set the data size.
-
-Optionally, you can provide data to POST using the \fICURLOPT_READFUNCTION\fP
-and \fICURLOPT_READDATA\fP options but then you must make sure to not set
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP to anything but NULL. When providing data with a
-callback, you must transmit it using chunked transfer-encoding or you must set
-the size of the data with the \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE\fP or
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE\fP option. To enable chunked encoding, you
-simply pass in the appropriate Transfer-Encoding header, see the
-post-callback.c example.
-
-You can override the default POST Content-Type: header by setting your own
-with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP.
-
-Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
-You can disable this header with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP as usual.
-
-If you use POST to a HTTP 1.1 server, you can send data without knowing the
-size before starting the POST if you use chunked encoding. You enable this by
-adding a header like "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" with
-\fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP. With HTTP 1.0 or without chunked transfer, you must
-specify the size in the request.
-
-When setting \fICURLOPT_POST\fP to 1, it will automatically set
-\fICURLOPT_NOBODY\fP to 0 (since 7.14.1).
-
-If you issue a POST request and then want to make a HEAD or GET using the same
-re-used handle, you must explicitly set the new request type using
-\fICURLOPT_NOBODY\fP or \fICURLOPT_HTTPGET\fP or similar.
+Issue a HTTP POST request. See \fICURLOPT_POST(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS
-Pass a void * as parameter, which should be the full data to post in a HTTP
-POST operation. You must make sure that the data is formatted the way you want
-the server to receive it. libcurl will not convert or encode it for you. Most
-web servers will assume this data to be url-encoded.
-
-The pointed data are NOT copied by the library: as a consequence, they must
-be preserved by the calling application until the transfer finishes.
-
-This POST is a normal application/x-www-form-urlencoded kind (and libcurl will
-set that Content-Type by default when this option is used), which is the most
-commonly used one by HTML forms. See also the \fICURLOPT_POST\fP. Using
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP implies \fICURLOPT_POST\fP.
-
-If you want to do a zero-byte POST, you need to set
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE\fP explicitly to zero, as simply setting
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP to NULL or "" just effectively disables the sending
-of the specified string. libcurl will instead assume that you'll send the POST
-data using the read callback!
-
-Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
-You can disable this header with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP as usual.
-
-To make multipart/formdata posts (aka RFC2388-posts), check out the
-\fICURLOPT_HTTPPOST\fP option.
+Send a POST with this data. See \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE
-If you want to post data to the server without letting libcurl do a strlen()
-to measure the data size, this option must be used. When this option is used
-you can post fully binary data, which otherwise is likely to fail. If this
-size is set to -1, the library will use strlen() to get the size.
+The POST data is this big. See \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE
-Pass a curl_off_t as parameter. Use this to set the size of the
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP data to prevent libcurl from doing strlen() on the
-data to figure out the size. This is the large file version of the
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE\fP option. (Added in 7.11.1)
+The POST data is this big. See \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should be the full data to post in a HTTP
-POST operation. It behaves as the \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP option, but the
-original data are copied by the library, allowing the application to overwrite
-the original data after setting this option.
-
-Because data are copied, care must be taken when using this option in
-conjunction with \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE\fP or
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE\fP: If the size has not been set prior to
-\fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS\fP, the data are assumed to be a NUL-terminated
-string; else the stored size informs the library about the data byte count to
-copy. In any case, the size must not be changed after
-\fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS\fP, unless another \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP or
-\fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS\fP option is issued.
-(Added in 7.17.1)
+Send a POST with this data - and copy it. See \fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HTTPPOST
-Tells libcurl you want a multipart/formdata HTTP POST to be made and you
-instruct what data to pass on to the server.  Pass a pointer to a linked list
-of curl_httppost structs as parameter.  The easiest way to create such a
-list, is to use \fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP as documented. The data in this list
-must remain intact until you close this curl handle again with
-\fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP.
-
-Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
-You can disable this header with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP as usual.
-
-When setting \fICURLOPT_HTTPPOST\fP, it will automatically set
-\fICURLOPT_NOBODY\fP to 0 (since 7.14.1).
+Multipart formpost HTTP POST. See \fICURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_REFERER
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to
-set the Referer: header in the http request sent to the remote server. This
-can be used to fool servers or scripts. You can also set any custom header
-with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP.
+Referer: header. See \fICURLOPT_REFERER(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_USERAGENT
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to
-set the User-Agent: header in the http request sent to the remote server. This
-can be used to fool servers or scripts. You can also set any custom header
-with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP.
+User-Agent: header. See \fICURLOPT_USERAGENT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER
-Pass a pointer to a linked list of HTTP headers to pass to the server and/or
-proxy in your HTTP request. The same list is used for both host and proxy
-requests!
-
-The linked list should be a fully valid list of \fBstruct curl_slist\fP
-structs properly filled in. Use \fIcurl_slist_append(3)\fP to create the list
-and \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP to clean up an entire list. If you add a
-header that is otherwise generated and used by libcurl internally, your added
-one will be used instead. If you add a header with no content as in 'Accept:'
-(no data on the right side of the colon), the internally used header will get
-disabled. With this option you can add new headers, replace internal headers
-and remove internal headers. To add a header with no content (nothing to the
-right side of the colon), use the form 'MyHeader;' (note the ending
-semicolon).
-
-The headers included in the linked list must not be CRLF-terminated, because
-curl adds CRLF after each header item. Failure to comply with this will result
-in strange bugs because the server will most likely ignore part of the headers
-you specified.
-
-The first line in a request (containing the method, usually a GET or POST) is
-not a header and cannot be replaced using this option. Only the lines
-following the request-line are headers. Adding this method line in this list
-of headers will only cause your request to send an invalid header.
-
-Pass a NULL to this to reset back to no custom headers.
-
-The most commonly replaced headers have "shortcuts" in the options
-\fICURLOPT_COOKIE\fP, \fICURLOPT_USERAGENT\fP and \fICURLOPT_REFERER\fP.
-
-There's an alternative option that sets or replaces headers only for requests
-that are sent with CONNECT to a proxy: \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER\fP. Use
-\fICURLOPT_HEADEROPT\fP to control the behavior.
+Custom HTTP headers. See \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HEADEROPT
-Pass a long that is a bitmask of options of how to deal with headers. The two
-mutually exclusive options are:
-
-CURLHEADER_UNIFIED - keep working as before. This means CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER
-headers will be used in requests both to servers and proxies. With this option
-enabled, \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER\fP will not have any effect.
-
-CURLHEADER_SEPARATE - makes \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP headers only get sent to
-a server and not to a proxy. Proxy headers must be set with
-\fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER\fP to get used. Note that if a non-CONNECT request is
-sent to a proxy, libcurl will send both server headers and proxy headers. When
-doing CONNECT, libcurl will send \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER\fP headers only do the
-proxy and then \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP headers only to the server.
-
-(Added in 7.37.0)
+Control custom headers. See \fICURLOPT_HEADEROPT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXYHEADER
-Pass a pointer to a linked list of HTTP headers to pass in your HTTP request
-sent to a proxy. The rules for this list is identical to the
-\fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP option's.
-
-The headers set with this option is only ever used in requests sent to a proxy
-- when there's also a request sent to a host.
-
-The first line in a request (containing the method, usually a GET or POST) is
-NOT a header and cannot be replaced using this option. Only the lines
-following the request-line are headers. Adding this method line in this list
-of headers will only cause your request to send an invalid header.
-
-Pass a NULL to this to reset back to no custom headers.
-
-This option was added in libcurl 7.37.0.
+Custom HTTP headers sent to proxy. See \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES
-Pass a pointer to a linked list of aliases to be treated as valid HTTP 200
-responses.  Some servers respond with a custom header response line.  For
-example, IceCast servers respond with "ICY 200 OK".  By including this string
-in your list of aliases, the response will be treated as a valid HTTP header
-line such as "HTTP/1.0 200 OK". (Added in 7.10.3)
-
-The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct curl_slist structs, and
-be properly filled in.  Use \fIcurl_slist_append(3)\fP to create the list and
-\fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP to clean up an entire list.
-
-The alias itself is not parsed for any version strings. Before libcurl 7.16.3,
-Libcurl used the value set by option \fICURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION\fP, but starting
-with 7.16.3 the protocol is assumed to match HTTP 1.0 when an alias matched.
+Alternative versions of 200 OK. See \fICURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_COOKIE
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to
-set a cookie in the http request. The format of the string should be
-NAME=CONTENTS, where NAME is the cookie name and CONTENTS is what the cookie
-should contain.
-
-If you need to set multiple cookies, you need to set them all using a single
-option and thus you need to concatenate them all in one single string. Set
-multiple cookies in one string like this: "name1=content1; name2=content2;"
-etc.
-
-This option sets the cookie header explicitly in the outgoing request(s). If
-multiple requests are done due to authentication, followed redirections or
-similar, they will all get this cookie passed on.
-
-Using this option multiple times will only make the latest string override the
-previous ones.
+Cookie(s) to send. See \fICURLOPT_COOKIE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It should contain the
-name of your file holding cookie data to read. The cookie data may be in
-Netscape / Mozilla cookie data format or just regular HTTP-style headers
-dumped to a file.
-
-Given an empty or non-existing file or by passing the empty string (""), this
-option will enable cookies for this curl handle, making it understand and
-parse received cookies and then use matching cookies in future requests.
-
-If you use this option multiple times, you just add more files to read.
-Subsequent files will add more cookies.
+File to read cookies from. See \fICURLOPT_COOKIEFILE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR
-Pass a file name as char *, zero terminated. This will make libcurl write all
-internally known cookies to the specified file when \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP
-is called. If no cookies are known, no file will be created. Specify "-" to
-instead have the cookies written to stdout. Using this option also enables
-cookies for this session, so if you for example follow a location it will make
-matching cookies get sent accordingly.
-
-If the cookie jar file can't be created or written to (when the
-\fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP is called), libcurl will not and cannot report an
-error for this. Using \fICURLOPT_VERBOSE\fP or \fICURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION\fP
-will get a warning to display, but that is the only visible feedback you get
-about this possibly lethal situation.
+File to write cookies to. See \fICURLOPT_COOKIEJAR(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_COOKIESESSION
-Pass a long set to 1 to mark this as a new cookie "session". It will force
-libcurl to ignore all cookies it is about to load that are "session cookies"
-from the previous session. By default, libcurl always stores and loads all
-cookies, independent if they are session cookies or not. Session cookies are
-cookies without expiry date and they are meant to be alive and existing for
-this "session" only.
+Start a new cookie session. See \fICURLOPT_COOKIESESSION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_COOKIELIST
-Pass a char * to a cookie string. Cookie can be either in Netscape / Mozilla
-format or just regular HTTP-style header (Set-Cookie: ...) format. If cURL
-cookie engine was not enabled it will enable its cookie engine.  Passing a
-magic string \&"ALL" will erase all cookies known by cURL. (Added in 7.14.1)
-Passing the special string \&"SESS" will only erase all session cookies known
-by cURL. (Added in 7.15.4) Passing the special string \&"FLUSH" will write
-all cookies known by cURL to the file specified by \fICURLOPT_COOKIEJAR\fP.
-(Added in 7.17.1)
+Add or control cookies. See \fICURLOPT_COOKIELIST(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_HTTPGET
-Pass a long. If the long is 1, this forces the HTTP request to get back
-to GET. Usable if a POST, HEAD, PUT, or a custom request has been used
-previously using the same curl handle.

-specified using the mailing list name, such as "Friends" or "London-Office".
-(Added in 7.34.0)
+Address of the recipients. See \fICURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. This will be used
-to specify the authentication address (identity) of a submitted message that
-is being relayed to another server.
-
-This optional parameter allows co-operating agents in a trusted environment to
-communicate the authentication of individual messages and should only be used
-by the application program, using libcurl, if the application is itself a
-mail server acting in such an environment. If the application is operating as
-such and the AUTH address is not known or is invalid, then an empty string
-should be used for this parameter.
-
-Unlike CURLOPT_MAIL_FROM and CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT, the address should not be
-specified within a pair of angled brackets (<>). However, if an empty string
-is used then a pair of brackets will be sent by libcurl as required by
-RFC2554.
-
-(Added in 7.25.0)
+Authentication address. See \fICURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH(3)\fP
 .SH TFTP OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_TFTP_BLKSIZE
-Specify block size to use for TFTP data transmission. Valid range as per
-RFC2348 is 8-65464 bytes. The default of 512 bytes will be used if this option
-is not specified. The specified block size will only be used pending support
-by the remote server. If the server does not return an option acknowledgement
-or returns an option acknowledgement with no blksize, the default of 512 bytes
-will be used. (added in 7.19.4)
+TFTP block size. See \fICURLOPT_TFTP_BLKSIZE(3)\fP
 .SH FTP OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_FTPPORT
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used to
-get the IP address to use for the FTP PORT instruction. The PORT instruction
-tells the remote server to connect to our specified IP address. The string may
-be a plain IP address, a host name, a network interface name (under Unix) or
-just a '-' symbol to let the library use your system's default IP
-address. Default FTP operations are passive, and thus won't use PORT.
-
-The address can be followed by a ':' to specify a port, optionally followed by
-a '-' to specify a port range.  If the port specified is 0, the operating
-system will pick a free port.  If a range is provided and all ports in the
-range are not available, libcurl will report CURLE_FTP_PORT_FAILED for the
-handle.  Invalid port/range settings are ignored.  IPv6 addresses followed by
-a port or portrange have to be in brackets.  IPv6 addresses without port/range
-specifier can be in brackets.  (added in 7.19.5)
-
-Examples with specified ports:
-
-.nf
-  eth0:0
-  192.168.1.2:32000-33000
-  curl.se:32123
-  [::1]:1234-4567
-.fi
-
-You disable PORT again and go back to using the passive version by setting
-this option to NULL.
+Use active FTP. See \fICURLOPT_FTPPORT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_QUOTE
-Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP or SFTP commands to pass to the server
-prior to your FTP request. This will be done before any other commands are
-issued (even before the CWD command for FTP). The linked list should be a
-fully valid list of 'struct curl_slist' structs properly filled in with text
-strings. Use \fIcurl_slist_append(3)\fP to append strings (commands) to the
-list, and clear the entire list afterwards with
-\fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP. Disable this operation again by setting a NULL
-to this option. When speaking to a FTP (or SFTP since 7.24.0) server, prefix
-the command with an asterisk (*) to make libcurl continue even if the command
-fails as by default libcurl will stop at first failure.
-
-The set of valid FTP commands depends on the server (see RFC959 for a list of
-mandatory commands).
-
-The valid SFTP commands are: chgrp, chmod, chown, ln, mkdir, pwd, rename, rm,
-rmdir, symlink (see
-.BR curl (1))
-(SFTP support added in 7.16.3)
+Commands to run before transfer. See \fICURLOPT_QUOTE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE
-Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP or SFTP commands to pass to the server
-after your FTP transfer request. The commands will only be run if no error
-occurred. The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct curl_slist
-structs properly filled in as described for \fICURLOPT_QUOTE\fP. Disable this
-operation again by setting a NULL to this option.
+Commands to run after transfer. See \fICURLOPT_POSTQUOTE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PREQUOTE
-Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP commands to pass to the server after
-the transfer type is set. The linked list should be a fully valid list of
-struct curl_slist structs properly filled in as described for
-\fICURLOPT_QUOTE\fP. Disable this operation again by setting a NULL to this
-option. Before version 7.16.0, if you also set \fICURLOPT_NOBODY\fP to 1, this
-option didn't work.
+Commands to run just before transfer. See \fICURLOPT_PREQUOTE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to just list the names of files in a
-directory, instead of doing a full directory listing that would include file
-sizes, dates etc. This works for FTP and SFTP URLs.
-
-This causes an FTP NLST command to be sent on an FTP server.  Beware that some
-FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they might not include
-subdirectories and symbolic links.
-
-Setting this option to 1 also implies a directory listing even if the URL
-doesn't end with a slash, which otherwise is necessary.
-
-Do NOT use this option if you also use \fICURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH\fP as it will
-effectively break that feature then.
-
-(This option was known as CURLOPT_FTPLISTONLY up to 7.16.4)
+List only. See \fICURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_APPEND
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to append to the remote file instead of
-overwrite it. This is only useful when uploading to an FTP site.
-
-(This option was known as CURLOPT_FTPAPPEND up to 7.16.4)
+Append to remote file. See \fICURLOPT_APPEND(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT
-Pass a long. If the value is 1, it tells curl to use the EPRT (and
-LPRT) command when doing active FTP downloads (which is enabled by
-\fICURLOPT_FTPPORT\fP). Using EPRT means that it will first attempt to use
-EPRT and then LPRT before using PORT, but if you pass zero to this
-option, it will not try using EPRT or LPRT, only plain PORT. (Added in 7.10.5)
-
-If the server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect as of 7.12.3.
+Use EPTR. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV
-Pass a long. If the value is 1, it tells curl to use the EPSV command
-when doing passive FTP downloads (which it always does by default). Using EPSV
-means that it will first attempt to use EPSV before using PASV, but if you
-pass zero to this option, it will not try using EPSV, only plain PASV.
-
-If the server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect as of 7.12.3.
+Use EPSV. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_USE_PRET
-Pass a long. If the value is 1, it tells curl to send a PRET command before
-PASV (and EPSV). Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd, require this non-standard
-command for directory listings as well as up and downloads in PASV mode. Has
-no effect when using the active FTP transfers mode.  (Added in 7.20.0)
+Use PRET. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_USE_PRET(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS
-Pass a long. If the value is 1, curl will attempt to create any remote
-directory that it fails to CWD into. CWD is the command that changes working
-directory. (Added in 7.10.7)
-
-This setting also applies to SFTP-connections. curl will attempt to create
-the remote directory if it can't obtain a handle to the target-location. The
-creation will fail if a file of the same name as the directory to create
-already exists or lack of permissions prevents creation. (Added in 7.16.3)
-
-Starting with 7.19.4, you can also set this value to 2, which will make
-libcurl retry the CWD command again if the subsequent MKD command fails. This
-is especially useful if you're doing many simultaneous connections against the
-same server and they all have this option enabled, as then CWD may first fail
-but then another connection does MKD before this connection and thus MKD fails
-but trying CWD works! 7.19.4 also introduced the \fICURLFTP_CREATE_DIR\fP and
-\fICURLFTP_CREATE_DIR_RETRY\fP enum names for these arguments.
-
-Before version 7.19.4, libcurl will simply ignore arguments set to 2 and act
-as if 1 was selected.
+Create missing dirs on the remote server. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT
-Pass a long.  Causes curl to set a timeout period (in seconds) on the amount
-of time that the server is allowed to take in order to generate a response
-message for a command before the session is considered hung.  While curl is
-waiting for a response, this value overrides \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT\fP. It is
-recommended that if used in conjunction with \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT\fP, you set
-\fICURLOPT_FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT\fP to a value smaller than
-\fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT\fP.  (Added in 7.10.8)
+Timeout for FTP responses. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER
-Pass a char * as parameter, pointing to a string which will be used to
-authenticate if the usual FTP "USER user" and "PASS password" negotiation
-fails. This is currently only known to be required when connecting to
-Tumbleweed's Secure Transport FTPS server using client certificates for
-authentication. (Added in 7.15.5)
+Alternative to USER. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP
-Pass a long. If set to 1, it instructs libcurl to not use the IP address the
-server suggests in its 227-response to libcurl's PASV command when libcurl
-connects the data connection. Instead libcurl will re-use the same IP address
-it already uses for the control connection. But it will use the port number
-from the 227-response. (Added in 7.14.2)
-
-This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead of PASV.
+Ignore the IP address in the PASV response. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTPSSLAUTH
-Pass a long using one of the values from below, to alter how libcurl issues
-\&"AUTH TLS" or "AUTH SSL" when FTP over SSL is activated (see
-\fICURLOPT_USE_SSL\fP). (Added in 7.12.2)
-.RS
-.IP CURLFTPAUTH_DEFAULT
-Allow libcurl to decide.
-.IP CURLFTPAUTH_SSL
-Try "AUTH SSL" first, and only if that fails try "AUTH TLS".
-.IP CURLFTPAUTH_TLS
-Try "AUTH TLS" first, and only if that fails try "AUTH SSL".
-.RE
+Control how to do TLS. See \fICURLOPT_FTPSSLAUTH(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC
-If enabled, this option makes libcurl use CCC (Clear Command Channel). It
-shuts down the SSL/TLS layer after authenticating. The rest of the
-control channel communication will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers
-to follow the FTP transaction. Pass a long using one of the values below.
-(Added in 7.16.1)
-.RS
-.IP CURLFTPSSL_CCC_NONE
-Don't attempt to use CCC.
-.IP CURLFTPSSL_CCC_PASSIVE
-Do not initiate the shutdown, but wait for the server to do it. Do not send
-a reply.
-.IP CURLFTPSSL_CCC_ACTIVE
-Initiate the shutdown and wait for a reply.
-.RE
+Back to non-TLS again after authentication. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string (or NULL to disable). When an FTP
-server asks for "account data" after user name and password has been provided,
-this data is sent off using the ACCT command. (Added in 7.13.0)
+Send ACCT command. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD
-Pass a long that should have one of the following values. This option controls
-what method libcurl should use to reach a file on a FTP(S) server. The
-argument should be one of the following alternatives:
-.RS
-.IP CURLFTPMETHOD_MULTICWD
-libcurl does a single CWD operation for each path part in the given URL. For
-deep hierarchies this means many commands. This is how RFC1738 says it
-should be done. This is the default but the slowest behavior.
-.IP CURLFTPMETHOD_NOCWD
-libcurl does no CWD at all. libcurl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a
-full path to the server for all these commands. This is the fastest behavior.
-.IP CURLFTPMETHOD_SINGLECWD
-libcurl does one CWD with the full target directory and then operates on the
-file \&"normally" (like in the multicwd case). This is somewhat more standards
-compliant than 'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.
-.RE
-(Added in 7.15.1)
+Specify how to reach files. See \fICURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD(3)\fP
 .SH RTSP OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_RTSP_REQUEST
-Tell libcurl what kind of RTSP request to make. Pass one of the following RTSP
-enum values. Unless noted otherwise, commands require the Session ID to be
-initialized. (Added in 7.20.0)
-.RS
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_OPTIONS
-Used to retrieve the available methods of the server. The application is
-responsible for parsing and obeying the response. \fB(The session ID is not
-needed for this method.)\fP  (Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_DESCRIBE
-Used to get the low level description of a stream. The application should note
-what formats it understands in the \fI'Accept:'\fP header. Unless set
-manually, libcurl will automatically fill in \fI'Accept:
-application/sdp'\fP. Time-condition headers will be added to Describe requests
-if the \fICURLOPT_TIMECONDITION\fP option is active. \fB(The session ID is not
-needed for this method)\fP  (Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_ANNOUNCE
-When sent by a client, this method changes the description of the session. For
-example, if a client is using the server to record a meeting, the client can
-use Announce to inform the server of all the meta-information about the
-session.  ANNOUNCE acts like a HTTP PUT or POST just like
-\fICURL_RTSPREQ_SET_PARAMETER\fP (Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_SETUP
-Setup is used to initialize the transport layer for the session. The
-application must set the desired Transport options for a session by using the
-\fICURLOPT_RTSP_TRANSPORT\fP option prior to calling setup. If no session ID
-is currently set with \fICURLOPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID\fP, libcurl will extract and
-use the session ID in the response to this request. \fB(The session ID is not
-needed for this method).\fP  (Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_PLAY
-Send a Play command to the server. Use the \fICURLOPT_RANGE\fP option to
-modify the playback time (e.g. 'npt=10-15').  (Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_PAUSE
-Send a Pause command to the server. Use the \fICURLOPT_RANGE\fP option with a
-single value to indicate when the stream should be halted. (e.g. npt='25')
-(Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_TEARDOWN
-This command terminates an RTSP session. Simply closing a connection does not
-terminate the RTSP session since it is valid to control an RTSP session over
-different connections.  (Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_GET_PARAMETER
-Retrieve a parameter from the server. By default, libcurl will automatically
-include a \fIContent-Type: text/parameters\fP header on all non-empty requests
-unless a custom one is set. GET_PARAMETER acts just like a HTTP PUT or POST
-(see \fICURL_RTSPREQ_SET_PARAMETER\fP).
-Applications wishing to send a heartbeat message (e.g. in the presence of a
-server-specified timeout) should send use an empty GET_PARAMETER request.
-(Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_SET_PARAMETER
-Set a parameter on the server. By default, libcurl will automatically include
-a \fIContent-Type: text/parameters\fP header unless a custom one is set. The
-interaction with SET_PARAMTER is much like a HTTP PUT or POST. An application
-may either use \fICURLOPT_UPLOAD\fP with \fICURLOPT_READDATA\fP like a HTTP
-PUT, or it may use \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP like a HTTP POST. No chunked
-transfers are allowed, so the application must set the
-\fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE\fP in the former and \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE\fP in the
-latter. Also, there is no use of multi-part POSTs within RTSP. (Added in
-7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_RECORD
-Used to tell the server to record a session. Use the \fICURLOPT_RANGE\fP
-option to modify the record time. (Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURL_RTSPREQ_RECEIVE
-This is a special request because it does not send any data to the server. The
-application may call this function in order to receive interleaved RTP
-data. It will return after processing one read buffer of data in order to give
-the application a chance to run. (Added in 7.20.0)
-.RE
+RTSP request. See \fICURLOPT_RTSP_REQUEST(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID
-Pass a char * as a parameter to set the value of the current RTSP Session ID
-for the handle. Useful for resuming an in-progress session. Once this value is
-set to any non-NULL value, libcurl will return \fICURLE_RTSP_SESSION_ERROR\fP
-if ID received from the server does not match. If unset (or set to NULL),
-libcurl will automatically set the ID the first time the server sets it in a
-response. (Added in 7.20.0)
+RTSP session-id. See \fICURLOPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RTSP_STREAM_URI
-Set the stream URI to operate on by passing a char * . For example, a single
-session may be controlling \fIrtsp://foo/twister/audio\fP and
-\fIrtsp://foo/twister/video\fP and the application can switch to the
-appropriate stream using this option. If unset, libcurl will default to
-operating on generic server options by passing '*' in the place of the RTSP
-Stream URI. This option is distinct from \fICURLOPT_URL\fP. When working with
-RTSP, the \fICURLOPT_STREAM_URI\fP indicates what URL to send to the server in
-the request header while the \fICURLOPT_URL\fP indicates where to make the
-connection to.  (e.g. the \fICURLOPT_URL\fP for the above examples might be
-set to \fIrtsp://foo/twister\fP (Added in 7.20.0)
+RTSP stream URI. See \fICURLOPT_RTSP_STREAM_URI(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RTSP_TRANSPORT
-Pass a char * to tell libcurl what to pass for the Transport: header for this
-RTSP session. This is mainly a convenience method to avoid needing to set a
-custom Transport: header for every SETUP request. The application must set a
-Transport: header before issuing a SETUP request. (Added in 7.20.0)
-.IP CURLOPT_RTSP_HEADER
-This option is simply an alias for \fICURLOPT_HTTP_HEADER\fP. Use this to
-replace the standard headers that RTSP and HTTP share. It is also valid to use
-the shortcuts such as \fICURLOPT_USERAGENT\fP. (Added in 7.20.0)
+RTSP Transport: header. See \fICURLOPT_RTSP_TRANSPORT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RTSP_CLIENT_CSEQ
-Manually set the the CSEQ number to issue for the next RTSP request. Useful if
-the application is resuming a previously broken connection. The CSEQ will
-increment from this new number henceforth. (Added in 7.20.0)
+Client CSEQ number. See \fICURLOPT_RTSP_CLIENT_CSEQ(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RTSP_SERVER_CSEQ
-Manually set the CSEQ number to expect for the next RTSP Server->Client
-request.  At the moment, this feature (listening for Server requests) is
-unimplemented. (Added in 7.20.0)
+CSEQ number for RTSP Server->Client request. See \fICURLOPT_RTSP_SERVER_CSEQ(3)\fP
 .SH PROTOCOL OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to use ASCII mode for FTP transfers,
-instead of the default binary transfer. For win32 systems it does not set the
-stdout to binary mode. This option can be usable when transferring text data
-between systems with different views on certain characters, such as newlines
-or similar.
-
-libcurl does not do a complete ASCII conversion when doing ASCII transfers
-over FTP. This is a known limitation/flaw that nobody has rectified. libcurl
-simply sets the mode to ASCII and performs a standard transfer.
+Use text transfer. See \fICURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_PROXY_TRANSFER_MODE
-Pass a long. If the value is set to 1 (one), it tells libcurl to set the
-transfer mode (binary or ASCII) for FTP transfers done via a HTTP proxy, by
-appending ;type=a or ;type=i to the URL. Without this setting, or it being set
-to 0 (zero, the default), \fICURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT\fP has no effect when doing
-FTP via a proxy. Beware that not all proxies support this feature.  (Added in
-7.18.0)
+Add transfer mode to URL over proxy. See \fICURLOPT_PROXY_TRANSFER_MODE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CRLF
-Pass a long. If the value is set to 1 (one), libcurl converts Unix newlines to
-CRLF newlines on transfers. Disable this option again by setting the value to
-0 (zero).
+Convert newlines. See \fICURLOPT_CRLF(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RANGE
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should contain the specified range you
-want. It should be in the format "X-Y", where X or Y may be left out. HTTP
-transfers also support several intervals, separated with commas as in
-\fI"X-Y,N-M"\fP. Using this kind of multiple intervals will cause the HTTP
-server to send the response document in pieces (using standard MIME separation
-techniques). For RTSP, the formatting of a range should follow RFC2326
-Section 12.29. For RTSP, byte ranges are \fBnot\fP permitted. Instead, ranges
-should be given in npt, utc, or smpte formats.
-
-Pass a NULL to this option to disable the use of ranges.
-
-Ranges work on HTTP, FTP, FILE (since 7.18.0), and RTSP (since 7.20.0)
-transfers only.
+Range requests. See \fICURLOPT_RANGE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM
-Pass a long as parameter. It contains the offset in number of bytes that you
-want the transfer to start from. Set this option to 0 to make the transfer
-start from the beginning (effectively disabling resume). For FTP, set this
-option to -1 to make the transfer start from the end of the target file
-(useful to continue an interrupted upload).
-
-When doing uploads with FTP, the resume position is where in the local/source
-file libcurl should try to resume the upload from and it will then append the
-source file to the remote target file.
+Resume a transfer. See \fICURLOPT_RESUME_FROM(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE
-Pass a curl_off_t as parameter. It contains the offset in number of bytes that
-you want the transfer to start from. (Added in 7.11.0)
+Resume a transfer. See \fICURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter.
-
-When you change the request method by setting \fBCURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST\fP to
-something, you don't actually change how libcurl behaves or acts in regards
-to the particular request method, it will only change the actual string sent
-in the request.
-
-Restore to the internal default by setting this to NULL.
-
-This option can be used to specify the request:
-
-.B HTTP
-
-Instead of GET or HEAD when performing HTTP based requests. This is
-particularly useful, for example, for performing a HTTP DELETE request.
-
-For example:
-
-When you tell libcurl to do a HEAD request, but then specify a GET though a
-custom request libcurl will still act as if it sent a HEAD. To switch to a
-proper HEAD use \fICURLOPT_NOBODY\fP, to switch to a proper POST use
-\fICURLOPT_POST\fP or \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP and to switch to a proper GET
-use CURLOPT_HTTPGET.
-
-Please don't perform this at will, on HTTP based requests, by making sure
-your server supports the command you are sending first.
-
-Many people have wrongly used this option to replace the entire request with
-their own, including multiple headers and POST contents. While that might
-work in many cases, it will cause libcurl to send invalid requests and it
-could possibly confuse the remote server badly. Use \fICURLOPT_POST\fP and
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\fP to set POST data. Use \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP to
-replace or extend the set of headers sent by libcurl. Use
-\fICURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION\fP to change HTTP version.
-
-.B FTP
-
-Instead of LIST and NLST when performing FTP directory listings.
-
-.B IMAP
-
-Instead of LIST when issuing IMAP based requests. (Added in 7.30.0)
-
-.B POP3
-
-Instead of LIST and RETR when issuing POP3 based requests. (Added in 7.26.0)
-
-For example:
-
-When you tell libcurl to use a custom request it will behave like a LIST or
-RETR command was sent where it expects data to be returned by the server. As
-such \fICURLOPT_NOBODY\fP should be used when specifying commands such as
-DELE and NOOP for example.
-
-.B SMTP
-
-Instead of a HELP or VRFY when issuing SMTP based requests. (Added in 7.34.0)
-
-For example:
-
-Normally a multiline response is returned which can be used, in conjuection with
-\fICURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT\fP, to specify an EXPN request. If the \fICURLOPT_NOBODY\fP
-option is specified then the request can be used to issue NOOP and RSET
-commands.
+Custom request/method. See \fICURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FILETIME
-Pass a long. If it is 1, libcurl will attempt to get the modification date of
-the remote document in this operation. This requires that the remote server
-sends the time or replies to a time querying command. The
-\fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP function with the \fICURLINFO_FILETIME\fP argument
-can be used after a transfer to extract the received time (if any).
+Request file modification date and time. See \fICURLOPT_FILETIME(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_NOBODY
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to not include the body-part in the
-output. This is only relevant for protocols that have separate header and
-body parts. On HTTP(S) servers, this will make libcurl do a HEAD request.
-
-To change request to GET, you should use \fICURLOPT_HTTPGET\fP. Change
-request to POST with \fICURLOPT_POST\fP etc.
+Do not get the body contents. See \fICURLOPT_NOBODY(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_INFILESIZE
-When uploading a file to a remote site, this option should be used to tell
-libcurl what the expected size of the infile is. This value should be passed
-as a long. See also \fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE\fP.
-
-For uploading using SCP, this option or \fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE\fP is
-mandatory.
-
-To "unset" this value again, set it to -1.

+Size of file to send. \fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_UPLOAD
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to prepare for an upload. The
-\fICURLOPT_READDATA\fP and \fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE\fP or
-\fICURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE\fP options are also interesting for uploads. If
-the protocol is HTTP, uploading means using the PUT request unless you tell
-libcurl otherwise.
-
-Using PUT with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
-You can disable this header with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP as usual.
-
-If you use PUT to a HTTP 1.1 server, you can upload data without knowing the
-size before starting the transfer if you use chunked encoding. You enable this
-by adding a header like "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" with
-\fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER\fP. With HTTP 1.0 or without chunked transfer, you must
-specify the size.
+Upload data. See \fICURLOPT_UPLOAD(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE
-Pass a long as parameter. This allows you to specify the maximum size (in
-bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is larger than this value,
-the transfer will not start and CURLE_FILESIZE_EXCEEDED will be returned.
-
-The file size is not always known prior to download, and for such files this
-option has no effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than this
-given limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers.
+Maximum file size to get. See \fICURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE
-Pass a curl_off_t as parameter. This allows you to specify the maximum size
-(in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is larger than this
-value, the transfer will not start and \fICURLE_FILESIZE_EXCEEDED\fP will be
-returned. (Added in 7.11.0)

-given limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers.
+Maximum file size to get. See \fICURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION
-Pass a long as parameter. This defines how the \fICURLOPT_TIMEVALUE\fP time
-value is treated. You can set this parameter to \fICURL_TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE\fP
-or \fICURL_TIMECOND_IFUNMODSINCE\fP. This feature applies to HTTP, FTP, RTSP,
-and FILE.
-
-The last modification time of a file is not always known and in such instances
-this feature will have no effect even if the given time condition would not
-have been met. \fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP with the
-\fICURLINFO_CONDITION_UNMET\fP option can be used after a transfer to learn if
-a zero-byte successful "transfer" was due to this condition not matching.
+Make a time conditional request. See \fICURLOPT_TIMECONDITION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE
-Pass a long as parameter. This should be the time in seconds since 1 Jan 1970,
-and the time will be used in a condition as specified with
-\fICURLOPT_TIMECONDITION\fP.
+Time value for the time conditional request. See \fICURLOPT_TIMEVALUE(3)\fP
 .SH CONNECTION OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_TIMEOUT
-Pass a long as parameter containing the maximum time in seconds that you allow
-the libcurl transfer operation to take. Normally, name lookups can take a
-considerable time and limiting operations to less than a few minutes risk
-aborting perfectly normal operations. This option will cause curl to use the
-SIGALRM to enable time-outing system calls.
-
-In unix-like systems, this might cause signals to be used unless
-\fICURLOPT_NOSIGNAL\fP is set.
-
-Default timeout is 0 (zero) which means it never times out.
+Timeout for the entire request. See \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS
-An alternative to \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT\fP but takes number of milliseconds
-instead. If libcurl is built to use the standard system name resolver, that
-portion of the transfer will still use full-second resolution for timeouts
-with a minimum timeout allowed of one second.
-
-If both \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT\fP and \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS\fP are set, the value
-set last will be used.
-
-(Added in 7.16.2)
+Millisecond timeout for the entire request. See \fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT
-Pass a long as parameter. It contains the transfer speed in bytes per second
-that the transfer should be below during \fICURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME\fP seconds
-for the library to consider it too slow and abort.
+Low speed limit to abort transfer. See \fICURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME
-Pass a long as parameter. It contains the time in seconds that the transfer
-should be below the \fICURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT\fP for the library to consider
-it too slow and abort.
+Time to be below the speed to trigger low speed abort. See \fICURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE
-Pass a curl_off_t as parameter.  If an upload exceeds this speed (counted in
-bytes per second) on cumulative average during the transfer, the transfer will
-pause to keep the average rate less than or equal to the parameter value.
-Defaults to unlimited speed.
-
-This option doesn't affect transfer speeds done with FILE:// URLs. (Added in
- 7.15.5)
+Cap upload speed to this. See \fICURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE
-Pass a curl_off_t as parameter.  If a download exceeds this speed (counted in
-bytes per second) on cumulative average during the transfer, the transfer will
-pause to keep the average rate less than or equal to the parameter
-value. Defaults to unlimited speed.
-
-This option doesn't affect transfer speeds done with FILE:// URLs. (Added in
-7.15.5)
+Cap download speed to this. See \fICURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS
-Pass a long. The set number will be the persistent connection cache size. The
-set amount will be the maximum amount of simultaneously open connections that
-libcurl may cache in this easy handle. Default is 5, and there isn't much
-point in changing this value unless you are perfectly aware of how this works
-and changes libcurl's behaviour. This concerns connections using any of the
-protocols that support persistent connections.
-
-When reaching the maximum limit, curl closes the oldest one in the cache to
-prevent increasing the number of open connections.
-
-If you already have performed transfers with this curl handle, setting a
-smaller MAXCONNECTS than before may cause open connections to get closed
-unnecessarily.
-
-If you add this easy handle to a multi handle, this setting is not
-acknowledged, and you must instead use \fIcurl_multi_setopt(3)\fP and the
-\fICURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS\fP option.
-.IP CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY
-(Obsolete) This option does nothing.
+Max number of connection is connection pool. See \fICURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT
-Pass a long. Set to 1 to make the next transfer use a new (fresh) connection
-by force. If the connection cache is full before this connection, one of the
-existing connections will be closed as according to the selected or default
-policy. This option should be used with caution and only if you understand
-what it does. Set this to 0 to have libcurl attempt re-using an existing
-connection (default behavior).
+Use a new connection. \fICURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE
-Pass a long. Set to 1 to make the next transfer explicitly close the
-connection when done. Normally, libcurl keeps all connections alive when done
-with one transfer in case a succeeding one follows that can re-use them.
-This option should be used with caution and only if you understand what it
-does. Set to 0 to have libcurl keep the connection open for possible later
-re-use (default behavior).
+Prevent subsequent connections from re-using this. See \fICURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT
-Pass a long. It should contain the maximum time in seconds that you allow the
-connection to the server to take.  This only limits the connection phase, once
-it has connected, this option is of no more use. Set to zero to switch to the
-default built-in connection timeout - 300 seconds. See also the
-\fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT\fP option.
-
-In unix-like systems, this might cause signals to be used unless
-\fICURLOPT_NOSIGNAL\fP is set.
+Timeout for the connection phase. See \fICURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS
-Like \fICURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT\fP but takes the number of milliseconds
-instead. If libcurl is built to use the standard system name resolver,
-that portion of the connect will still use full-second resolution for
-timeouts with a minimum timeout allowed of one second.
-(Added in 7.16.2)
+Millisecond timeout for the connection phase. See \fICURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE
-Allows an application to select what kind of IP addresses to use when
-resolving host names. This is only interesting when using host names that
-resolve addresses using more than one version of IP. The allowed values are:
-.RS
-.IP CURL_IPRESOLVE_WHATEVER
-Default, resolves addresses to all IP versions that your system allows.
-.IP CURL_IPRESOLVE_V4
-Resolve to IPv4 addresses.
-.IP CURL_IPRESOLVE_V6
-Resolve to IPv6 addresses.
-.RE
+IP version to resolve to. See \fICURLOPT_IPRESOLVE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY
-Pass a long. If the parameter equals 1, it tells the library to perform all
-the required proxy authentication and connection setup, but no data transfer.
-This option is implemented for HTTP, SMTP and POP3.
-
-The option can be used to simply test a connection to a server, but is more
-useful when used with the \fICURLINFO_LASTSOCKET\fP option to
-\fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP as the library can set up the connection and then
-the application can obtain the most recently used socket for special data
-transfers. (Added in 7.15.2)
+Only connect, nothing else. See \fICURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_USE_SSL
-Pass a long using one of the values from below, to make libcurl use your
-desired level of SSL for the transfer. (Added in 7.11.0)
-
-This is for enabling SSL/TLS when you use FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP etc.
-
-(This option was known as CURLOPT_FTP_SSL up to 7.16.4, and the constants
-were known as CURLFTPSSL_*)
-.RS
-.IP CURLUSESSL_NONE
-Don't attempt to use SSL.
-.IP CURLUSESSL_TRY
-Try using SSL, proceed as normal otherwise.
-.IP CURLUSESSL_CONTROL

-.IP CURLUSESSL_ALL
-Require SSL for all communication or fail with \fICURLE_USE_SSL_FAILED\fP.
-.RE
+Use TLS/SSL. See \fICURLOPT_USE_SSL(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RESOLVE
-Pass a pointer to a linked list of strings with host name resolve information
-to use for requests with this handle. The linked list should be a fully valid
-list of \fBstruct curl_slist\fP structs properly filled in. Use
-\fIcurl_slist_append(3)\fP to create the list and \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP
-to clean up an entire list.
-
-Each single name resolve string should be written using the format
-HOST:PORT:ADDRESS where HOST is the name libcurl will try to resolve, PORT is
-the port number of the service where libcurl wants to connect to the HOST and
-ADDRESS is the numerical IP address. If libcurl is built to support IPv6,
-ADDRESS can of course be either IPv4 or IPv6 style addressing.
-
-This option effectively pre-populates the DNS cache with entries for the
-host+port pair so redirects and everything that operations against the
-HOST+PORT will instead use your provided ADDRESS. Addresses to set with
-\fICURL_RESOLVE\fP will not time-out from the DNS cache like ordindary
-entries.
-
-You can remove names from the DNS cache again, to stop providing these fake
-resolves, by including a string in the linked list that uses the format
-\&"-HOST:PORT". The host name must be prefixed with a dash, and the host name
-and port number must exactly match what was already added previously.
-
-(Added in 7.21.3)
-.IP CURLOPT_DNS_SERVERS
-Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system default.
-The format of the dns servers option is:
-
-host[:port][,host[:port]]...
-
-For example:
-
-192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101,3.4.5.6
-
-This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that
-supports this operation. The c-ares backend is the only such one.

+Provide fixed/fake name resolves. See \fICURLOPT_RESOLVE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_DNS_INTERFACE
-Pass a char * as parameter. Set the name of the network interface that
-the DNS resolver should bind to. This must be an interface name (not an
-address). Set this option to NULL to use the default setting (don't
-bind to a specific interface).
-
-This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that

 .IP CURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS
-Pass a long telling libcurl the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a
-server to connect back to libcurl when an active FTP connection is used. If no
-timeout is set, the internal default of 60000 will be used. (Added in 7.24.0)
+Timeout for waiting for the server's connect back to be accepted. See \fICURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS(3)\fP
 .SH SSL and SECURITY OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_SSLCERT
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be
-the file name of your certificate. The default format is "P12" on Secure
-Transport and "PEM" on other engines, and can be changed with
-\fICURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE\fP.
-
-With NSS or Secure Transport, this can also be the nickname of the certificate
-you wish to authenticate with as it is named in the security database. If you
-want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it with "./"
-prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.
+Client cert. See \fICURLOPT_SSLCERT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be
-the format of your certificate. Supported formats are "PEM" and "DER", except
-with Secure Transport. OpenSSL (versions 0.9.3 and later) and Secure Transport
-(on iOS 5 or later, or OS X 10.7 or later) also support "P12" for
-PKCS#12-encoded files. (Added in 7.9.3)
+Client cert type.  See \fICURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSLKEY
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be
-the file name of your private key. The default format is "PEM" and can be
-changed with \fICURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE\fP.
-
-(iOS and Mac OS X only) This option is ignored if curl was built against Secure
-Transport. Secure Transport expects the private key to be already present in
-the keychain or PKCS#12 file containing the certificate.
+Client key. See \fICURLOPT_SSLKEY(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be
-the format of your private key. Supported formats are "PEM", "DER" and "ENG".
-
-The format "ENG" enables you to load the private key from a crypto engine. In
-this case \fICURLOPT_SSLKEY\fP is used as an identifier passed to the
-engine. You have to set the crypto engine with \fICURLOPT_SSLENGINE\fP.
-\&"DER" format key file currently does not work because of a bug in OpenSSL.
+Client key type. See \fICURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used as
-the password required to use the \fICURLOPT_SSLKEY\fP or

+Client key password. See \fICURLOPT_KEYPASSWD(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_ALPN
-Pass a long as parameter, 0 or 1 where 1 is for enable and 0 for disable. By
-default, libcurl assumes a value of 1. This option enables/disables ALPN in
-the SSL handshake (if the SSL backend libcurl is built to use supports it),

-returned.
-
-Even though this option doesn't need any parameter, in some configurations
-\fIcurl_easy_setopt\fP might be defined as a macro taking exactly three

 .IP CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER
-Pass a long as parameter. By default, curl assumes a value of 1.
-
-This option determines whether curl verifies the authenticity of the peer's
-certificate. A value of 1 means curl verifies; 0 (zero) means it doesn't.
-
-When negotiating a SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating
-its identity.  Curl verifies whether the certificate is authentic, i.e. that
-you can trust that the server is who the certificate says it is.  This trust
-is based on a chain of digital signatures, rooted in certification authority
-(CA) certificates you supply.  curl uses a default bundle of CA certificates
-(the path for that is determined at build time) and you can specify alternate
-certificates with the \fICURLOPT_CAINFO\fP option or the \fICURLOPT_CAPATH\fP
-option.
-
-When \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP is nonzero, and the verification fails to
-prove that the certificate is authentic, the connection fails.  When the
-option is zero, the peer certificate verification succeeds regardless.
-
-Authenticating the certificate is not by itself very useful.  You typically
-want to ensure that the server, as authentically identified by its
-certificate, is the server you mean to be talking to.  Use
-\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST\fP to control that. The check that the host name in
-the certificate is valid for the host name you're connecting to is done
-independently of the \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP option.
+Verify the SSL certificate. See \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CAINFO
-Pass a char * to a zero terminated string naming a file holding one or more
-certificates to verify the peer with.  This makes sense only when used in
-combination with the \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP option.  If
-\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP is zero, \fICURLOPT_CAINFO\fP need not
-even indicate an accessible file.
-
-This option is by default set to the system path where libcurl's cacert bundle
-is assumed to be stored, as established at build time.
-
-If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module
-(libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this option to work properly.
+CA cert bundle. See \fICURLOPT_CAINFO(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT
-Pass a char * to a zero terminated string naming a file holding a CA
-certificate in PEM format. If the option is set, an additional check against
-the peer certificate is performed to verify the issuer is indeed the one
-associated with the certificate provided by the option. This additional check
-is useful in multi-level PKI where one needs to enforce that the peer
-certificate is from a specific branch of the tree.
-
-This option makes sense only when used in combination with the
-\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP option. Otherwise, the result of the check is not
-considered as failure.
-
-A specific error code (CURLE_SSL_ISSUER_ERROR) is defined with the option,
-which is returned if the setup of the SSL/TLS session has failed due to a
-mismatch with the issuer of peer certificate (\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP has
-to be set too for the check to fail). (Added in 7.19.0)
+Issuer certificate. See \fICURLOPT_ISSUERCERT(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CAPATH
-Pass a char * to a zero terminated string naming a directory holding multiple
-CA certificates to verify the peer with. If libcurl is built against OpenSSL,
-the certificate directory must be prepared using the openssl c_rehash utility.
-This makes sense only when used in combination with the
-\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP option.  If \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP is zero,
-\fICURLOPT_CAPATH\fP need not even indicate an accessible path.  The
-\fICURLOPT_CAPATH\fP function apparently does not work in Windows due to some
-limitation in openssl. This option is OpenSSL-specific and does nothing if
-libcurl is built to use GnuTLS. NSS-powered libcurl provides the option only
-for backward compatibility.
+Path to CA cert bundle. See \fICURLOPT_CAPATH(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_CRLFILE
-Pass a char * to a zero terminated string naming a file with the concatenation
-of CRL (in PEM format) to use in the certificate validation that occurs during
-the SSL exchange.
-
-When curl is built to use NSS or GnuTLS, there is no way to influence the use
-of CRL passed to help in the verification process. When libcurl is built with
-OpenSSL support, X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK and X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL are both
-set, requiring CRL check against all the elements of the certificate chain if
-a CRL file is passed.
-
-This option makes sense only when used in combination with the
-\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP option.
-
-A specific error code (CURLE_SSL_CRL_BADFILE) is defined with the option. It
-is returned when the SSL exchange fails because the CRL file cannot be loaded.
-A failure in certificate verification due to a revocation information found in
-the CRL does not trigger this specific error. (Added in 7.19.0)
+Certificate Revocation List. See \fICURLOPT_CRLFILE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
-Pass a long as parameter.
-
-This option determines whether libcurl verifies that the server cert is for
-the server it is known as.
-
-When negotiating a SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating
-its identity.
-
-When \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST\fP is 2, that certificate must indicate that
-the server is the server to which you meant to connect, or the connection
-fails.
-
-Curl considers the server the intended one when the Common Name field or a
-Subject Alternate Name field in the certificate matches the host name in the
-URL to which you told Curl to connect.
-
-When the value is 1, \fIcurl_easy_setopt\fP will return an error and the option
-value will not be changed.  It was previously (in 7.28.0 and earlier) a debug
-option of some sorts, but it is no longer supported due to frequently leading
-to programmer mistakes.
-
-When the value is 0, the connection succeeds regardless of the names in the
-certificate.
-
-The default value for this option is 2.
-
-This option controls checking the server's certificate's claimed identity.
-The server could be lying.  To control lying, see
-\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP.  If libcurl is built against NSS and
-\fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER\fP is zero, \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST\fP is also set
-to zero and cannot be overridden.

-and data about the certificates in the certificate chain used in the SSL
-connection. This data may then be retrieved after a transfer using
-\fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP and its option \fICURLINFO_CERTINFO\fP. (Added in
-7.19.1)
+Extract certificate info. See \fICURLOPT_CERTINFO(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE
-Pass a char * to a zero terminated file name. The file will be used to read
-from to seed the random engine for SSL. The more random the specified file is,
-the more secure the SSL connection will become.
+Provide source for entropy random data. See \fICURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET
-Pass a char * to the zero terminated path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon
-socket. It will be used to seed the random engine for SSL.
+Identify EGD socket for entropy. See \fICURLOPT_EGDSOCKET(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST
-Pass a char *, pointing to a zero terminated string holding the list of
-ciphers to use for the SSL connection. The list must be syntactically correct,
-it consists of one or more cipher strings separated by colons. Commas or
-spaces are also acceptable separators but colons are normally used, \&!, \&-
-and \&+ can be used as operators.
-
-For OpenSSL and GnuTLS valid examples of cipher lists include 'RC4-SHA',
-\'SHA1+DES\', 'TLSv1' and 'DEFAULT'. The default list is normally set when you
-compile OpenSSL.
-
-You'll find more details about cipher lists on this URL:
-\fIhttp://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html\fP
-
-For NSS, valid examples of cipher lists include 'rsa_rc4_128_md5',
-\'rsa_aes_128_sha\', etc. With NSS you don't add/remove ciphers. If one uses
-this option then all known ciphers are disabled and only those passed in
-are enabled.

 .IP CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE
-Pass a long set to 0 to disable libcurl's use of SSL session-ID caching. Set
-this to 1 to enable it. By default all transfers are done using the
-cache. While nothing ever should get hurt by attempting to reuse SSL
-session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
-require you to disable this in order for you to succeed. (Added in 7.16.0)
+Disable SSL session-id cache. See \fICURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS
-Pass a long with a bitmask to tell libcurl about specific SSL behaviors.
-
-CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST is the only supported bit and by setting this the user
-will tell libcurl to not attempt to use any workarounds for a security flaw
-in the SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols.  If this option isn't used or this bit is
-set to 0, the SSL layer libcurl uses may use a work-around for this flaw
-although it might cause interoperability problems with some (older) SSL
-implementations. WARNING: avoiding this work-around loosens the security, and
-by setting this option to 1 you ask for exactly that. (Added in 7.25.0)
+Control SSL behavior. See \fICURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL
-Pass a char * as parameter. Set the kerberos security level for FTP; this also
-enables kerberos awareness.  This is a string, \&'clear', \&'safe',
-\&'confidential' or \&'private'.  If the string is set but doesn't match one
-of these, 'private' will be used. Set the string to NULL to disable kerberos
-support for FTP.
-
-(This option was known as CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL up to 7.16.3)
+Kerberos security level. See \fICURLOPT_KRBLEVEL(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION
-Set the parameter to CURLGSSAPI_DELEGATION_FLAG to allow unconditional GSSAPI
-credential delegation.  The delegation is disabled by default since 7.21.7.
-Set the parameter to CURLGSSAPI_DELEGATION_POLICY_FLAG to delegate only if
-the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set in the service ticket in case this feature is
-supported by the GSSAPI implementation and the definition of
-GSS_C_DELEG_POLICY_FLAG was available at compile-time.
-(Added in 7.22.0)
+Disable GSS-API delegation. See \fICURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION(3)\fP
 .SH SSH OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_SSH_AUTH_TYPES
-Pass a long set to a bitmask consisting of one or more of
-CURLSSH_AUTH_PUBLICKEY, CURLSSH_AUTH_PASSWORD, CURLSSH_AUTH_HOST,
-CURLSSH_AUTH_KEYBOARD and CURLSSH_AUTH_AGENT. Set CURLSSH_AUTH_ANY to let
-libcurl pick a suitable one. Currently CURLSSH_AUTH_HOST has no effect. (Added
-in 7.16.1) If CURLSSH_AUTH_AGENT is used, libcurl attempts to connect to
-ssh-agent or pageant and let the agent attempt the authentication. (Added in
-7.28.0)
+SSH authentication types. See \fICURLOPT_SSH_AUTH_TYPES(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_MD5
-Pass a char * pointing to a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits. The
-string should be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote host's public key, and
-libcurl will reject the connection to the host unless the md5sums match. This
-option is only for SCP and SFTP transfers. (Added in 7.17.1)
+MD5 of host's public key. See \fICURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_MD5(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE
-Pass a char * pointing to a file name for your public key. If not used,
-libcurl defaults to \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub\fP if the HOME environment
-variable is set, and just "id_dsa.pub" in the current directory if HOME is not
-set.  (Added in 7.16.1)
-If an empty string is passed, libcurl will pass no public key to libssh2
-which then tries to compute it from the private key, this is known to work
-when libssh2 1.4.0+ is linked against OpenSSL. (Added in 7.26.0)
+File name of public key. See \fICURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE
-Pass a char * pointing to a file name for your private key. If not used,
-libcurl defaults to \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa\fP if the HOME environment variable
-is set, and just "id_dsa" in the current directory if HOME is not set.  If the
-file is password-protected, set the password with
-\fICURLOPT_KEYPASSWD\fP. (Added in 7.16.1)
+File name of private key. See \fICURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSH_KNOWNHOSTS
-Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string holding the file name of the
-known_host file to use.  The known_hosts file should use the OpenSSH file
-format as supported by libssh2. If this file is specified, libcurl will only
-accept connections with hosts that are known and present in that file, with a
-matching public key. Use \fICURLOPT_SSH_KEYFUNCTION\fP to alter the default
-behavior on host and key (mis)matching. (Added in 7.19.6)
+File name with known hosts. See \fICURLOPT_SSH_KNOWNHOSTS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSH_KEYFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a curl_sshkeycallback function. It gets called when the
-known_host matching has been done, to allow the application to act and decide
-for libcurl how to proceed. The callback will only be called if
-\fICURLOPT_SSH_KNOWNHOSTS\fP is also set.
-
-.nf

-
-The curl_sshkeycallback function gets passed the CURL handle, the key from the
-known_hosts file, the key from the remote site, info from libcurl on the
-matching status and a custom pointer (set with \fICURLOPT_SSH_KEYDATA\fP). It
-MUST return one of the following return codes to tell libcurl how to act:
-.RS
-.IP CURLKHSTAT_FINE_ADD_TO_FILE
-The host+key is accepted and libcurl will append it to the known_hosts file
-before continuing with the connection. This will also add the host+key combo
-to the known_host pool kept in memory if it wasn't already present there. The
-adding of data to the file is done by completely replacing the file with a new
-copy, so the permissions of the file must allow this.
-.IP CURLKHSTAT_FINE
-The host+key is accepted libcurl will continue with the connection. This will
-also add the host+key combo to the known_host pool kept in memory if it wasn't
-already present there.
-.IP CURLKHSTAT_REJECT
-The host+key is rejected. libcurl will deny the connection to continue and it
-will be closed.
-.IP CURLKHSTAT_DEFER
-The host+key is rejected, but the SSH connection is asked to be kept alive.
-This feature could be used when the app wants to somehow return back and act
-on the host+key situation and then retry without needing the overhead of
-setting it up from scratch again.

+Callback for known hosts handling. See \fICURLOPT_SSH_KEYFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SSH_KEYDATA
-Pass a void * as parameter. This pointer will be passed along verbatim to the
-callback set with \fICURLOPT_SSH_KEYFUNCTION\fP. (Added in 7.19.6)
+Custom pointer to pass to ssh key callback. See \fICURLOPT_SSH_KEYDATA(3)\fP
 .SH OTHER OPTIONS
 .IP CURLOPT_PRIVATE
-Pass a void * as parameter, pointing to data that should be associated with
-this curl handle.  The pointer can subsequently be retrieved using
-\fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP with the CURLINFO_PRIVATE option. libcurl itself
-does nothing with this data. (Added in 7.10.3)
+Private pointer to store. See \fICURLOPT_PRIVATE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLOPT_SHARE
-Pass a share handle as a parameter. The share handle must have been created by
-a previous call to \fIcurl_share_init(3)\fP. Setting this option, will make
-this curl handle use the data from the shared handle instead of keeping the
-data to itself. This enables several curl handles to share data. If the curl
-handles are used simultaneously in multiple threads, you \fBMUST\fP use the
-locking methods in the share handle. See \fIcurl_share_setopt(3)\fP for
-details.
-
-If you add a share that is set to share cookies, your easy handle will use
-that cookie cache and get the cookie engine enabled. If you unshare an object
-that was using cookies (or change to another object that doesn't share

 <p class="level0">curl_easy_setopt() is used to tell libcurl how to behave. By using the appropriate options to <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_setopt</span>, you can change libcurl's behavior.  All options are set with the <span Class="emphasis">option</span> followed by a <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span>. That parameter can be a <span Class="bold">long</span>, a <span Class="bold">function pointer</span>, an <span Class="bold">object pointer</span> or a <span Class="bold">curl_off_t</span>, depending on what the specific option expects. Read this manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl to behave badly!  You can only set one option in each function call. A typical application uses many curl_easy_setopt() calls in the setup phase. 
-<p class="level0">Options set with this function call are valid for all forthcoming transfers performed using this <span Class="emphasis">handle</span>.

Consider building libcurl with c-ares support to enable asynchronous DNS lookups, which enables nice timeouts for name resolves without signals. 
-<p class="level1">Setting <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTNOSIGNAL">CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL</a> to 1 makes libcurl NOT ask the system to ignore SIGPIPE signals, which otherwise are sent by the system when trying to send data to a socket which is closed in the other end. libcurl makes an effort to never cause such SIGPIPEs to trigger, but some operating systems have no way to avoid them and even on those that have there are some corner cases when they may still happen, contrary to our desire.

This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received interleaved RTP data. This function gets called for each $ block and therefore contains exactly one upper-layer protocol unit (e.g.  one RTP packet). Curl writes the interleaved header as well as the included data for each call. The first byte is always an ASCII dollar sign. The dollar sign is followed by a one byte channel identifier and then a 2 byte integer length in network byte order. See <span Class="emphasis"><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2326.txt">RFC 2326</a> Section 10.12</span> for more information on how RTP interleaving behaves. If unset or set to NULL, curl will use the default write function. 
-<p class="level1">Interleaved RTP poses some challenges for the client application. Since the stream data is sharing the RTSP control connection, it is critical to service the RTP in a timely fashion. If the RTP data is not handled quickly, subsequent response processing may become unreasonably delayed and the connection may close. The application may use <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLRTSPREQRECEIVE">CURL_RTSPREQ_RECEIVE</a> to service RTP data when no requests are desired. If the application makes a request, (e.g.  <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLRTSPREQPAUSE">CURL_RTSPREQ_PAUSE</a>) then the response handler will process any pending RTP data before marking the request as finished.

This can be the fully qualified domain name of the server, the local network name of the machine on your network or the IP address of the server or machine represented by either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. For example: 
-<p class="level1"><a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a>

-<p class="level1">The port is optional and when not specified libcurl will use the default port based on the determined or specified protocol: 80 for HTTP, 21 for FTP and 25 for SMTP, etc. The following examples show how to specify the port: 
-<p class="level1"><a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>:8080/ - This will connect to a web server using port 8080 rather than 80. 
-<p class="level1">smtp://mail.example.com:587/ - This will connect to a SMTP server on the alternative mail port.

-<p class="level1">The path part of a HTTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what directory. If the directory is not specified then the web server's root directory is used. If the file is omitted then the default document will be retrieved for either the directory specified or the root directory. The exact resource returned for each URL is entirely dependent on the server's configuration. 
-<p class="level1"><a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a> - This gets the main page from the web server. 
-<p class="level1"><a href="http://www.example.com/index.html">http://www.example.com/index.html</a> - This returns the main page by explicitly requesting it.

-<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#FTP">FTP</a> 
-<p class="level1">The path part of an FTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what directory.

-<p class="level1"><a href="ftp://ftp.example.com">ftp://ftp.example.com</a> - This retrieves the directory listing for the root directory. 
-<p class="level1"><a href="ftp://ftp.example.com/readme.txt">ftp://ftp.example.com/readme.txt</a> - This downloads the file readme.txt from the root directory.

-<p class="level1"><a href="ftp://user">ftp://user</a>:password@ftp.example.com/readme.txt - This retrieves the readme.txt file from the user's home directory. When a username and password is specified, everything that is specified in the path part is relative to the user's home directory. To retrieve files from the root directory or a directory underneath the root directory then the absolute path must be specified by prepending an additional forward slash to the beginning of the path. 
-<p class="level1"><a href="ftp://user">ftp://user</a>:password@ftp.example.com//readme.txt - This retrieves the readme.txt from the root directory when logging in as a specified user. 
-<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#SMTP">SMTP</a> 
-<p class="level1">The path part of a SMTP request specifies the host name to present during communication with the mail server. If the path is omitted then libcurl will attempt to resolve the local computer's host name. However, this may not return the fully qualified domain name that is required by some mail servers and specifying this path allows you to set an alternative name, such as your machine's fully qualified domain name, which you might have obtained from an external function such as gethostname or getaddrinfo. 
-<p class="level1">smtp://mail.example.com - This connects to the mail server at example.com and sends your local computer's host name in the HELO / EHLO command.

-<p class="level1">The path part of a SCP request specifies the file to retrieve and from what directory. The file part may not be omitted. The file is taken as an absolute path from the root directory on the server. To specify a path relative to the user's home directory on the server, prepend ~/ to the path portion. If the user name is not embedded in the URL, it can be set with the <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTUSERPWD">CURLOPT_USERPWD</a> or <a class="bold" href="#CURLOPTUSERNAME">CURLOPT_USERNAME</a> option.

 \fIlastitem\fP is set after each \fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP call and on repeated
 invokes it should be left as set to allow repeated invokes to find the end of
 the list faster.
 
 After the \fIlastitem\fP pointer follow the real arguments.
 
 The pointers \fIfirstitem\fP and \fIlastitem\fP should both be pointing to
 NULL in the first call to this function. All list-data will be allocated by
 the function itself. You must call \fIcurl_formfree(3)\fP on the
 \fIfirstitem\fP after the form post has been done to free the resources.
 
 Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.

 First, there are some basics you need to understand about multipart/formdata

 is made for file upload, there are also a stored CONTENT-TYPE and a FILENAME.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 curl_formfree() is used to clean up data previously built/appended with
 \fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP. This must be called when the data has been used, which
 typically means after \fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP has been called.
 
 The pointer to free is the same pointer you passed to the
-\fBCURLOPT_HTTPPOST\fP option, which is the \fIfirstitem\fP pointer from the
-\fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP invoke(s).
+\fBCURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)\fP option, which is the \fIfirstitem\fP pointer from
+the \fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP invoke(s).
 
 \fBform\fP is the pointer as returned from a previous call to
 \fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP and may be NULL.

 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">time zone items</span> Specifies international time zone. There are a few acronyms supported, but in general you should instead use the specific relative time compared to UTC. Supported formats include: -1200, MST, +0100.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 This function returns a CURLSH handle to be used as input to all the other
 share-functions, sometimes referred to as a share handle in some places in the
 documentation. This init call MUST have a corresponding call to
 \fIcurl_share_cleanup\fP when all operations using the share are complete.
 
-This \fIshare handle\fP is what you pass to curl using the \fICURLOPT_SHARE\fP
-option with \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP, to make that specific curl handle use
-the data in this share.
+This \fIshare handle\fP is what you pass to curl using the
+\fICURLOPT_SHARE(3)\fP option with \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP, to make that
+specific curl handle use the data in this share.
 .SH RETURN VALUE
 If this function returns NULL, something went wrong (out of memory, etc.)
 and therefore the share object was not created.
 .SH "SEE ALSO"
 .BR curl_share_cleanup "(3), " curl_share_setopt "(3)"

 <p class="level0">There are many bindings available that bring libcurl access to your favourite language. Look elsewhere for documentation on those. 
-<p class="level0">libcurl has a global constant environment that you must set up and maintain while using libcurl.

 <p class="level0">To actually transfer data you have the option of using the "easy" interface, or the "multi" interface. 
-<p class="level0">The easy interface is a synchronous interface with which you call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_perform.html">curl_easy_perform(3)</a> and let it perform the transfer.

 <p class="level0">The multi interface on the other hand is an asynchronous interface, that you call and that performs only a little piece of the transfer on each invoke. It is perfect if you want to do things while the transfer is in progress, or similar. The multi interface allows you to select() on libcurl action, and even to easily download multiple files simultaneously using a single thread. See further details in the <span Class="emphasis">libcurl-multi(3)</span> man page.

 <p class="level0">There are a variety of constants that libcurl uses, mainly through its internal use of other libraries, which are too complicated for the library loader to set up.  Therefore, a program must call a library function after the program is loaded and running to finish setting up the library code.  For example, when libcurl is built for SSL capability via the GNU TLS library, there is an elaborate tree inside that library that describes the SSL protocol. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span> is the function that you must call.  This may allocate resources (e.g. the memory for the GNU TLS tree mentioned above), so the companion function <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_cleanup()</span> releases them. 
 <p class="level0">The basic rule for constructing a program that uses libcurl is this: Call <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span>, with a <span Class="emphasis">CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</span> argument, immediately after the program starts, while it is still only one thread and before it uses libcurl at all.  Call <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_cleanup()</span> immediately before the program exits, when the program is again only one thread and after its last use of libcurl. 
 <p class="level0">You can call both of these multiple times, as long as all calls meet these requirements and the number of calls to each is the same. 
 <p class="level0">It isn't actually required that the functions be called at the beginning and end of the program -- that's just usually the easiest way to do it. It <span Class="emphasis">is</span> required that the functions be called when no other thread in the program is running.

 <p class="level0"><a name="Handle"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Handle the Easy libcurl</h2>
 <p class="level0">libcurl first introduced the so called easy interface. All operations in the easy interface are prefixed with 'curl_easy'. 
 <p class="level0">Recent libcurl versions also offer the multi interface. More about that interface, what it is targeted for and how to use it is detailed in a separate chapter further down. You still need to understand the easy interface first, so please continue reading for better understanding. 
 <p class="level0">To use the easy interface, you must first create yourself an easy handle. You need one handle for each easy session you want to perform. Basically, you should use one handle for every thread you plan to use for transferring. You must never share the same handle in multiple threads. 
 <p class="level0">Get an easy handle with 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;easyhandle = curl_easy_init(); 
 <p class="level0">It returns an easy handle. Using that you proceed to the next step: setting up your preferred actions. A handle is just a logic entity for the upcoming transfer or series of transfers. 
-<p class="level0">You set properties and options for this handle using <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt(3)</a>. They control how the subsequent transfer or transfers will be made. Options remain set in the handle until set again to something different. Alas, multiple requests using the same handle will use the same options. 
-<p class="level0">Many of the options you set in libcurl are "strings", pointers to data terminated with a zero byte. When you set strings with <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt(3)</a>, libcurl makes its own copy so that they don't need to be kept around in your application after being set[4].

+<p class="level0">One of the most basic properties to set in the handle is the URL. You set your preferred URL to transfer with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_URL(3)</span> in a manner similar to: 
 <p class="level0"><pre>
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_URL, "<a href="http://domain.com/">http://domain.com/</a>");
  </pre>
 
 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">Let's assume for a while that you want to receive data as the URL identifies a remote resource you want to get here. Since you write a sort of application that needs this transfer, I assume that you would like to get the data passed to you directly instead of simply getting it passed to stdout. So, you write your own function that matches this prototype: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;size_t write_data(void *buffer, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userp); 
 <p class="level0">You tell libcurl to pass all data to this function by issuing a function similar to this: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data); 
 <p class="level0">You can control what data your callback function gets in the fourth argument by setting another property: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &internal_struct); 
-<p class="level0">Using that property, you can easily pass local data between your application and the function that gets invoked by libcurl. libcurl itself won't touch the data you pass with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</span>. 
-<p class="level0">libcurl offers its own default internal callback that will take care of the data if you don't set the callback with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</span>. It will then simply output the received data to stdout. You can have the default callback write the data to a different file handle by passing a 'FILE *' to a file opened for writing with the <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</span> option. 
-<p class="level0">Now, we need to take a step back and have a deep breath. Here's one of those rare platform-dependent nitpicks. Did you spot it? On some platforms[2], libcurl won't be able to operate on files opened by the program. Thus, if you use the default callback and pass in an open file with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</span>, it will crash. You should therefore avoid this to make your program run fine virtually everywhere.

Your callback function should return the number of bytes it "took care of". If that is not the exact same amount of bytes that was passed to it, libcurl will abort the operation and return with an error code. 
-<p class="level0">When the transfer is complete, the function returns a return code that informs you if it succeeded in its mission or not. If a return code isn't enough for you, you can use the CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER to point libcurl to a buffer of yours where it'll store a human readable error message as well.

 <p class="level0">If you then want to transfer another file, the handle is ready to be used again. Mind you, it is even preferred that you re-use an existing handle if you intend to make another transfer. libcurl will then attempt to re-use the previous connection. 
 <p class="level0">For some protocols, downloading a file can involve a complicated process of logging in, setting the transfer mode, changing the current directory and finally transferring the file data. libcurl takes care of all that complication for you. Given simply the URL to a file, libcurl will take care of all the details needed to get the file moved from one machine to another. 
 <p class="level0"><a name="Multi-threading"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Multi-threading Issues</h2>
 <p class="level0">The first basic rule is that you must <span Class="bold">never</span> simultaneously share a libcurl handle (be it easy or multi or whatever) between multiple threads. Only use one handle in one thread at any time. You can pass the handles around among threads, but you must never use a single handle from more than one thread at any given time. 
 <p class="level0">libcurl is completely thread safe, except for two issues: signals and SSL/TLS handlers. Signals are used for timing out name resolves (during DNS lookup) - when built without c-ares support and not on Windows. 
 <p class="level0">If you are accessing HTTPS or FTPS URLs in a multi-threaded manner, you are then of course using the underlying SSL library multi-threaded and those libs might have their own requirements on this issue. Basically, you need to provide one or two functions to allow it to function properly. For all details, see this:

 <p class="level0"><a name="Upload"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Upload Data to a Remote Site</h2>
 <p class="level0">libcurl tries to keep a protocol independent approach to most transfers, thus uploading to a remote FTP site is very similar to uploading data to a HTTP server with a PUT request. 
 <p class="level0">Of course, first you either create an easy handle or you re-use one existing one. Then you set the URL to operate on just like before. This is the remote URL, that we now will upload. 
 <p class="level0">Since we write an application, we most likely want libcurl to get the upload data by asking us for it. To make it do that, we set the read callback and the custom pointer libcurl will pass to our read callback. The read callback should have a prototype similar to: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;size_t function(char *bufptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, void *userp); 
 <p class="level0">Where bufptr is the pointer to a buffer we fill in with data to upload and size*nitems is the size of the buffer and therefore also the maximum amount of data we can return to libcurl in this call.

The names of the variables are following an ancient de facto standard and are built up as "[protocol]_proxy" (note the lower casing). Which makes the variable 'http_proxy' checked for a name of a proxy to use when the input URL is HTTP. Following the same rule, the variable named 'ftp_proxy' is checked for FTP URLs. Again, the proxies are always HTTP proxies, the different names of the variables simply allows different HTTP proxies to be used. 
 <p class="level1">The proxy environment variable contents should be in the format "[protocol://][user:password@]machine[:port]". Where the protocol:// part is simply ignored if present (so <a href="http://proxy">http://proxy</a> and bluerk://proxy will do the same) and the optional port number specifies on which port the proxy operates on the host. If not specified, the internal default port number will be used and that is most likely *not* the one you would like it to be. 
 <p class="level1">There are two special environment variables. 'all_proxy' is what sets proxy for any URL in case the protocol specific variable wasn't set, and 'no_proxy' defines a list of hosts that should not use a proxy even though a variable may say so.

 <p class="level1">SSL is for secure point-to-point connections. This involves strong encryption and similar things, which effectively makes it impossible for a proxy to operate as a "man in between" which the proxy's task is, as previously discussed. Instead, the only way to have SSL work over a HTTP proxy is to ask the proxy to tunnel trough everything without being able to check or fiddle with the traffic. 
 <p class="level1">Opening an SSL connection over a HTTP proxy is therefor a matter of asking the proxy for a straight connection to the target host on a specified port. This is made with the HTTP request CONNECT. ("please mr proxy, connect me to that remote host"). 
 <p class="level1">Because of the nature of this operation, where the proxy has no idea what kind of data that is passed in and out through this tunnel, this breaks some of the very few advantages that come from using a proxy, such as caching.  Many organizations prevent this kind of tunneling to other destination port numbers than 443 (which is the default HTTPS port number).

 <p class="level0">FTP transfers use a second TCP/IP connection for the data transfer. This is usually a fact you can forget and ignore but at times this fact will come back to haunt you. libcurl offers several different ways to customize how the second connection is being made. 
 <p class="level0">libcurl can either connect to the server a second time or tell the server to connect back to it. The first option is the default and it is also what works best for all the people behind firewalls, NATs or IP-masquerading setups. libcurl then tells the server to open up a new port and wait for a second connection. This is by default attempted with EPSV first, and if that doesn't work it tries PASV instead. (EPSV is an extension to the original FTP spec and does not exist nor work on all FTP servers.)

 <p class="level1">Many of the protocols libcurl supports send name and password unencrypted as clear text (HTTP Basic authentication, FTP, TELNET etc). It is very easy for anyone on your network or a network nearby yours to just fire up a network analyzer tool and eavesdrop on your passwords. Don't let the fact that HTTP Basic uses base64 encoded passwords fool you. They may not look readable at a first glance, but they very easily "deciphered" by anyone within seconds. 
 <p class="level1">To avoid this problem, use HTTP authentication methods or other protocols that don't let snoopers see your password: HTTP with Digest, NTLM or GSS authentication, HTTPS, FTPS, SCP, SFTP and FTP-Kerberos are a few examples.

A redirect to a file: URL would cause the libcurl to read (or write) arbitrary files from the local filesystem.

 <p class="level1">If authentication credentials are stored in the ~/.netrc file, or Kerberos is in use, any other URL type (not just file:) that requires authentication is also at risk.  A redirect such as <a href="ftp://some-internal-server/private-file">ftp://some-internal-server/private-file</a> would then return data even when the server is password protected. 
 <p class="level1">In the same way, if an unencrypted SSH private key has been configured for the user running the libcurl application, SCP: or SFTP: URLs could access password or private-key protected resources, e.g. s<a href="ftp://user">ftp://user</a>@some-internal-server/etc/passwd

 <p class="level1">libcurl will normally handle IPv6 addresses transparently and just as easily as IPv4 addresses. That means that a sanitizing function that filters out addressses like 127.0.0.1 isn't sufficient--the equivalent IPv6 addresses ::1, ::, 0:00::0:1, ::127.0.0.1 and ::ffff:7f00:1 supplied somehow by an attacker would all bypass a naive filter and could allow access to undesired local resources.  IPv6 also has special address blocks like link-local and site-local that generally shouldn't be accessed by a server-side libcurl-using application.  A poorly-configured firewall installed in a data center, organization or server may also be configured to limit IPv4 connections but leave IPv6 connections wide open.  In some cases, the CURL_IPRESOLVE_V4 option can be used to limit resolved addresses to IPv4 only and bypass these issues.

 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">The easy interface as described in detail in this document is a synchronous interface that transfers one file at a time and doesn't return until it is done. 
 <p class="level0">The multi interface, on the other hand, allows your program to transfer multiple files in both directions at the same time, without forcing you to use multiple threads.  The name might make it seem that the multi interface is for multi-threaded programs, but the truth is almost the reverse.  The multi interface can allow a single-threaded application to perform the same kinds of multiple, simultaneous transfers that multi-threaded programs can perform.  It allows many of the benefits of multi-threaded transfers without the complexity of managing and synchronizing many threads. 
 <p class="level0">To use this interface, you are better off if you first understand the basics of how to use the easy interface. The multi interface is simply a way to make multiple transfers at the same time by adding up multiple easy handles into a "multi stack".

-<p class="level0">When you've added the handles you have for the moment (you can still add new ones at any time), you start the transfers by calling <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform(3)</a>. 
-<p class="level0"><a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform(3)</a> is asynchronous. It will only execute as little as possible and then return back control to your program. It is designed to never block. 
-<p class="level0">The best usage of this interface is when you do a select() on all possible file descriptors or sockets to know when to call libcurl again. This also makes it easy for you to wait and respond to actions on your own application's sockets/handles. You figure out what to select() for by using <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_fdset.html">curl_multi_fdset(3)</a>, that fills in a set of fd_set variables for you with the particular file descriptors libcurl uses for the moment.

Another precaution you should use: always call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_fdset.html">curl_multi_fdset(3)</a> immediately before the select() call since the current set of file descriptors may change when calling a curl function.

    * Support zlib
    * Support WinIDN
    * Use of static runtime libraries
    * Generate *.vcxproj.filters files for VC10, VC11 and VC12
-   * Use CURLX_* definitions for curl tool project generation
+   * Add the Test Suite components
    * Support for other development IDEs
 
    Any additional help would be appreciated ;-)
