+  Security flaw CVE-2013-6422
   
-  Signed-off-by: Andrej E Baranov <admin@andrej-andb.ru>
+  This is conceptually the same problem and fix that 3c3622b6 brought to the
+  OpenSSL backend and that resulted in CVE-2013-4545.
+  
+  This version of the problem was independently introduced to the GnuTLS
+  backend with commit 59cf93cc, present in the code since the libcurl
+  7.21.4 release.

-- curl: rename --bearer to --oauth2-bearer
+- curl.1 document -J doesn't %-decode
   
-  The option '--bearer' might be slightly ambiguous in name. It doesn't
-  create any conflict that I am aware of at the moment, however, OAUTH v2
-  is not the only authentication mechanism which uses "bearer" tokens.
+  ...also added as KNOWN_BUG #87 with reference to bug #1294

+- multi: add timer inaccuracy margin to timeout/connecttimeout
   
-  Reported-by: Kyle L. Huff
-  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-10/0064.html
+  Since all systems have inaccuracy in the timeout handling it is
+  imperative that we add an inaccuracy margin to the general timeout and
+  connecttimeout handling with the multi interface. This way, when the
+  timeout fires we should be fairly sure that it has passed the timeout
+  value and will be suitably detected.
+  
+  For cases where the timeout fire before the actual timeout, we would
+  otherwise consume the timeout action and still not run the timeout code
+  since the condition wasn't met.

-  ssh: improve the logic for detecting blocking direction
+- curl_easy_setopt: clarify some USERPWD and PROXYUSERPWD details

+- login options: remove the ;[options] support from CURLOPT_USERPWD
   
-  This fixes a regression introduced by commit 0feeab78 limiting the speed
-  of SCP upload to 16384 B/s on a fast connection (such as localhost).
+  To avoid the regression when users pass in passwords containing semi-
+  colons, we now drop the ability to set the login options with the same
+  options. Support for login options in CURLOPT_USERPWD was added in
+  7.31.0.
+  
+  Test case 83 was modified to verify that colons and semi-colons can be
+  used as part of the password when using -u (CURLOPT_USERPWD).

+- imap: Fixed exclude of clear text when using auth=* in commit 75cd7fd66762bb
+  
+  It is not 100% clear whether * should include clear text LOGIN or not
+  from RFC-5092, however, including it is then consistent with current
+  POP3 behaviour where clear text, APOP or SASL may be chosen.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (11 Oct 2013)
-- [Heinrich Schaefer brought this change]
+- imap: Fixed incorrect fallback to clear text authentication
+  
+  If a specific SASL authentication mechanism was requested by the user
+  as part of the login options but wasn't supported by the server then
+  curl would fallback to clear text, when it shouldn't, rather than
+  reporting "No known authentication mechanisms supported" as the POP3
+  and SMTP protocols do.

-- [Gisle Vanem brought this change]
+  parsedate: avoid integer overflow
+  
+  In C, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior. Thus, the compiler
+  is allowed to assume that it will not occur. In the check for an
+  overflow, the developer assumes that the signed integer of type time_t
+  will wrap around if it overflows. However, this behavior is undefined in
+  the C standard. Thus, when the compiler sees this, it simplifies t +
+  delta < t to delta < 0. Since delta > 0 and delta < 0 can't both be
+  true, the entire if statement is optimized out under certain
+  optimization levels. Thus, the parsedate function would return
+  PARSEDATE_OK with an undefined value in the time, instead of return -1 =
+  PARSEDATE_FAIL.
 
-  curl_setup_once: fix errno access for lwip on Windows
+- parseconfig: warn if unquoted white spaces are detected
   
-  lib/curl_setup_once.h assumed lwIP on Windows uses 'SetLastError()' to
-  set network errors. It doesn't; it uses 'errno'.
+  Commit 0db811b6 made some existing config files pass on unexpected
+  values to libcurl that made it somewhat hard to track down what was
+  really going on.
+  
+  This code detects unquoted white spaces in the parameter when parsing a
+  config file as that would be one symptom and it is generally a bad
+  syntax anyway.

+  darwinssl: Fix #if 10.6.0 for SecKeychainSearch
+  
+  The comment here says that SecKeychainSearch causes a deprecation
+  warning when used with a minimum Mac OS X SDK version of 10.7.0, which
+  is correct.  However, the #if guard did not match.  It was intended to
+  only use the code if 10.6.0 support was enabled, but it had 10.7.0
+  instead.  This caused a warning if the minimum was exactly 10.7.0.

-  Credit (for catching a cipher I forgot to add to the blocked ciphers list):
-  https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html
+  curl.h should also include <sys/select.h> on OpenBSD to reliably

-- OpenSSL: acknowledge CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST without VERIFYPEER

-  is fine or return failure.
+  The URI that is passed in as part of the Authorization: header needs to

+  POP3_TYPE_ANY, or ~0, is written to pop3c->preftype in lib/pop3c.c, an
+  unsigned int variable.  The result of ~0 is -1, which caused a warning
+  due to writing a negative number to an unsigned variable.  To fix this,
+  make the expression ~0U so that its value is considered the unsigned
+  number UINT_MAX which is what SASL_AUTH_ANY does in curl_sasl.h.

-- win32: fix Visual Studio 2010 build with WINVER >= 0x600

-  
-  Added missing information, from curl 7.31.0, regarding the use of the

-  
-  For example:
+- tests: Added SMTP HELP test
+
+- smtp: Changed the default command to HELP when no options are specified
   
-  --user 'user:password;auth=NTLM' in IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols.
+  Otherwise a NOOP operation would be performed which a) only returns a
+  single line response and not a multiline response where -I needs to be
+  used, and b) provides an inconsistent user experience compared to that
+  of the POP3 and IMAP protocols.
 
-- ftpserver.pl: Moved cURL SMTP server detection into EHLO command handler
+- smtp:Fixed memory leak from commit dac01ff6d788b2
   
-  Moved the special SMTP server detection code from the DATA command
-  handler, which happens further down the operation chain after EHLO,
-  MAIL and RCPT commands, to the EHLO command as it is the first command
-  to be generated by a SMTP operation as well as containing the special
-  "verifiedserver" string from the URL.
+  The buffer allocated by smtp_parse_custom_request() was not freed.
+
+- connect: Close open but unconnected socket in singleipconnect()
   
-  This not only makes it easier and quicker to detect but also means that
-  cURL doesn't need to specify "verifiedserver" as --mail-from and
-  --mail-rcpt arguments.
+  singleipconnect() could return the file descriptor of an open socket
+  even though the function returned a CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT error code
+  from commit ed1662c374361a and 02fbc26d59c591.
   
-  More importantly, this also makes the upcoming verification changes to

-  In ossl_connect_step2() when the "Unknown SSL protocol error" occurs, it
-  would output the local port number instead of the remote one which
-  showed when doing SSL over a proxy (but with the correct remote host
-  name). As libcurl only speaks SSL to the remote we know it is the remote

-  authentication using RFC6749 "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework".
+  warning: unused variable 'smtpc'
+
+- smtp: Fixed processing of more than one response when sent in same packet
   
-  The bearer token is expected to be valid for the user specified in
-  conn->user. If CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER is defined and the connection has
-  an advertised auth mechanism of "XOAUTH2", the user and access token are
-  formatted as a base64 encoded string and sent to the server as
-  "AUTH XOAUTH2 <bearer token>".
+  Added a loop to smtp_statemach_act() in which Curl_pp_readresp() is
+  called until the cache is drained. Without this multiple responses
+  received in a single packet could result in a hang or delay.
 
-- curl: Added clarification to the --mail options in the --help output
+- smtp: Moved EHLO response handling to smtp_state_ehlo_resp()
   
-  ... that these options apply to SMTP only.
+  Similar to the processing of untagged CAPABILITY responses in IMAP moved
+  the processing of multiline EHLO responses to smtp_state_ehlo_resp() and
+  introduced an internal response code of one to differentiate a multiline
+  continuation from the end of command. This also allows for the separate
+  processing of multiline responses from commands such as VRFY and EXPN.

-  and a CBC cipher, so we now always turn that on unless the user
-  manually turns it off using CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST.
+  connect: Return the socket descriptor even on fail
   
-  It appears Apple also added some new PSK ciphers, but no interface to

-- url: handle abortion by read/write callbacks, too
+- [Björn Stenberg brought this change]
+
+  Add "Happy Eyeballs" for IPv4/IPv6.
   
-  Otherwise, the FTP protocol would unnecessarily hang 60 seconds if
-  aborted in the CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION callback.
+  This patch invokes two socket connect()s nearly simultaneously, and
+  the socket that is first connected "wins" and is subsequently used for
+  the connection. The other is terminated.
   
-  Reported by: Tomas Mlcoch
-  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1005686
+  There is a very slight IPv4 preference, in that if both sockets connect
+  simultaneously IPv4 is checked first and thus will win.

+Steve Holme (27 Oct 2013)
+- email: Added initial support for cancelling authentication
   
-  Make sure that the custom struct fields are only used by code that
-  doesn't use a struct defintion from the outside.
+  Should a client application fail to decode an authentication message
+  received from a server, or not support any of the parameters given by
+  the server in the message, then the authentication phrase should be
+  cancelled gracefully by the client rather than simply terminating the
+  connection.
   
-  Attempts to fix the problem introduced in 3dc6fc42bfc61b
+  The authentication phrase should be cancelled by simply sending a '*'
+  to the server, in response to erroneous data being received, as per
+  RFC-3501, RFC-4954 and RFC-5034.
+  
+  This patch adds the necessary state machine constants and appropriate
+  response handlers in order to add this functionality for the CRAM-MD5,
+  DIGEST-MD5 and NTLM authentication mechanisms.

+Daniel Stenberg (26 Oct 2013)
+- FTP: make the data connection work when going through proxy
   
-  The transfer size would be calculated incorrectly if the email contained

-  layer. As such the following, example output, would be seen if the
-  amount remaining was smaller than the amount received:
+  This is a regression since the switch to always-multi internally

-  * transfer closed with -1112 bytes remaining to read
-  
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-08/0170.html
-  Reported-by: John Dunn
+  Test 1316 was modified since we now clearly call the Curl_client_write()

+- smtp: Fixed response code parsing for bad AUTH continuation responses
   
-  Additionally added the directive to the FILEFORMAT document.

-- ftpserver.pl: Corrected POP3 LIST as message numbers should be contiguous
+- gskit.c: Code policing following commit 2cc9246477285d
   
-  The message numbers given in the LIST response are an index into the
-  list, which are only valid for the current session, rather than being a
-  unique message identifier. An index would only be missing from the LIST
-  response if a DELE command had been issued within the same session and
-  had not been committed by the end of session QUIT command. Once
-  committed the POP3 server will regenerate the message numbers in the
-  next session to be contiguous again. As such our LIST response should
-  list message numbers contiguously until we support a DELE command in the
-  same session.
+  Corrected 80 character line length error and pointer declarations (some
+  of which were previously incorrect)
+
+- test907: Corrected DIGEST-MD5 response given in commit 820ed48a0088cd
   
-  Should a POP3 user require the unique message ID for any or all
-  messages then they should use the extended UIDL command. This command
-  will be supported by the test ftpserver in an upcoming commit.
+  As the URI, which is contained within the DIGEST-MD5 response, is
+  constructed from the service and realm, the encoded message differs
+  from that generated under POP3.

+  Setting only CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST without CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER set
+  should still verify that the host name fields in the server certificate
+  is fine or return failure.
   
-  We timeout code in multi_socket() allows code to run slightly before the

-  executed but refused in Curl_readwrite() and then the application would
-  just sit idling forever.

-
-- multi_init: moved init code here from add_handle
+  As someone reported on the mailing list a while back, the hard-coded

+- tests: Fixed smtp rcpt to addresses
 
-- curl_easy_perform_ev: debug/test function
-  
-  This function is meant to work *exactly* as curl_easy_perform() but will
-  use the event-based libcurl API internally instead of
-  curl_multi_perform(). To avoid relying on an actual event-based library
-  and to not use non-portable functions (like epoll or similar), there's a
-  rather inefficient emulation layer implemented on top of Curl_poll()
-  instead.
-  
-  There's currently some convenience logging done in curl_easy_perform_ev
-  which helps when tracking down problems. They may be suitable to remove
-  or change once things seem to be fine enough.
-  
-  curl has a new --test-event option when built with debug enabled that
-  then uses curl_easy_perform_ev() instead of curl_easy_perform(). If
-  built without debug, using --test-event will only output a warning
-  message.
-  
-  NOTE: curl_easy_perform_ev() is not part if the public API on purpose.
-  It is only present in debug builds of libcurl and MUST NOT be considered
-  stable even then. Use it for libcurl-testing purposes only.
+- ftpserver.pl: Expanded the SMTP RCPT handler to validate TO addresses

-  url: handle arbitrary-length username and password before '@'
-  
-  libcurl quietly truncates usernames, passwords, and options from
-  before an '@' sign in a URL to 255 (= MAX_CURL_PASSWORD_LENGTH - 1)
-  characters to fit in fixed-size buffers on the stack.  Allocate a
-  buffer large enough to fit the parsed fields on the fly instead to
-  support longer passwords.
-  
-  After this change, there are no more uses of MAX_CURL_OPTIONS_LENGTH
-  left, so stop defining that constant while at it.  The hardcoded max
-  username and password length constants, on the other hand, are still
-  used in HTTP proxy credential handling (which this patch doesn't
-  touch).
+- ftpserver.pl: Added cURL SMTP server detection to HELO command handler

+  As curl will send a HELO command after an negative EHLO response, added

+- ftpserver.pl: Moved invalid RCPT TO: address detection to RCPT handler
   
-  No functional change intended.  The main effect is to decrease the
-  indentation of this function slightly.

-- [Jonathan Nieder brought this change]
+  Rather than detecting the TO address as missing in the DATA handler,

-  Curl_setopt: handle arbitrary-length username and password
-  
-  libcurl truncates usernames, passwords, and options set with
-  curl_easy_setopt to 255 (= MAX_CURL_PASSWORD_LENGTH - 1) characters.
-  This doesn't affect the return value from curl_easy_setopt(), so from
-  the caller's point of view, there is no sign anything strange has
-  happened, except that authentication fails.
-  
-  For example:
-  
-    # Prepare a long (300-char) password.
-    s=0123456789; s=$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s$s; s=$s$s$s;
-    # Start a server.
-    nc -l -p 8888 | tee out & pid=$!
-    # Tell curl to pass the password to the server.
-    curl --user me:$s http://localhost:8888 & sleep 1; kill $pid
-    # Extract the password.
-    userpass=$(
-  	awk '/Authorization: Basic/ {print $3}' <out |
-  	tr -d '\r' |
-  	base64 -d
-    )
-    password=${userpass#me:}
-    echo ${#password}
-  
-  Expected result: 300
-  Actual result: 255
-  
-  The fix is simple: allocate appropriately sized buffers on the heap
-  instead of trying to squeeze the provided values into fixed-size
-  on-stack buffers.

-
-  url: use goto in create_conn() for exception handling
+  Moved the special SMTP server detection code from the DATA command

+  MAIL and RCPT commands, to the EHLO command as it is the first command
+  to be generated by a SMTP operation as well as containing the special
+  "verifiedserver" string from the URL.
   
-  Instead of remembering before each "return" statement which temporary
-  allocations, if any, need to be freed, take care to set pointers to
-  NULL when no longer needed and use a goto to a common block to exit
-  the function and free all temporaries.
+  This not only makes it easier and quicker to detect but also means that
+  cURL doesn't need to specify "verifiedserver" as --mail-from and
+  --mail-rcpt arguments.
   
-  No functional change intended.  Currently the only temporary buffer in
-  this function is "proxy" which is already correctly freed when
-  appropriate, but there will be more soon.

+  would output the local port number instead of the remote one which

+  The libcurl date parser returns INT_MAX for all dates > 2037 so this

-- glob: error out on range overflow
-  
-  The new multiply() function detects range value overflows. 32bit
-  machines will overflow on a 32bit boundary while 64bit hosts support
-  ranges up to the full 64 bit range.

+- tests: Reworked existing SMTP tests to be single recipient based
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1267
-  Reported-by: Will Dietz
+  ...in preparation of upcoming multiple recipient tests.
 
-- urlglob: better detect unclosed braces, empty lists and overflows
-  
-  A rather big overhaul and cleanup.
-  
-  1 - curl wouldn't properly detect and reject globbing that ended with an
-  open brace if there were brackets or braces before it. Like "{}{" or
-  "[0-1]{"
-  
-  2 - curl wouldn't properly reject empty lists so that "{}{}" would
-  result in curl getting (nil) strings in the output.
-  
-  3 - By using strtoul() instead of sscanf() the code will now detected
-  over and underflows. It now also better parses the step argument to only
-  accept positive numbers and only step counters that is smaller than the
-  delta between the maximum and minimum numbers.
-  
-  4 - By switching to unsigned longs instead of signed ints for the
-  counters, the max values for []-ranges are now very large (on 64bit
-  machines).
-  
-  5 - Bumped the maximum number of globs in a single URL to 100 (from 10)
-  
-  6 - Simplified the code somewhat and now it stores fixed strings as
-  single- entry lists. That's also one of the reasons why I did (5) as now
-  all strings between "globs" will take a slot in the array.
-  
-  Added test 1234 and 1235 to verify. Updated test 87.
-  
-  This commit fixes three separate bug reports.

-- multi: s/easy/data
-  
-  With everything being struct SessionHandle pointers now, this rename
-  makes multi.c use the library-wide practise of calling that pointer
-  'data' instead of the previously used 'easy'.

-- cleanup: removed one function, made one static

-
-- SessionHandle: the protocol specific pointer is now a void *
-  
-  All protocol handler structs are now opaque (void *) in the
-  SessionHandle struct and moved in the request-specific sub-struct
-  'SingleRequest'. The intension is to keep the protocol specific
-  knowledge in their own dedicated source files [protocol].c etc.
-  
-  There's some "leakage" where this policy is violated, to be addressed at
-  a later point in time.
-
-- urldata: clean up the use of the protocol specific structs
-  
-  1 - always allocate the struct in protocol->setup_connection. Some
-  protocol handlers had to get this function added.
-  
-  2 - always free at the end of a request. This is also an attempt to keep
-  less memory in the handle after it is completed.

-    1.1 SessionHandle
-    1.2 connectdata
-    1.3 Curl_multi

-- FTP: when EPSV gets a 229 but fails to connect, retry with PASV
-  
-  This is a regression as this logic used to work. It isn't clear when it
-  broke, but I'm assuming in 7.28.0 when we went all-multi internally.
-  
-  This likely never worked with the multi interface. As the failed
-  connection is detected once the multi state has reached DO_MORE, the
-  Curl_do_more() function was now expanded somewhat so that the
-  ftp_do_more() function can request to go "back" to the previous state
-  when it makes another attempt - using PASV.
-  
-  Added test case 1233 to verify this fix. It has the little issue that it
-  assumes no service is listening/accepting connections on port 1...

-  
-  The internal function that's used to detect known file extensions for

-  strlen() would be used which could lead to an out-of-bounds read (and
-  thus segfault). In most cases it would only lead to it not finding or
-  using the correct default content-type.
-  
-  It also showed that test 554 and test 587 were testing for the
-  previous/wrong behavior and now they're updated as well.

-
-- multi: remove the multi_pos struct field

-  Since Curl_one_easy is really a SessionHandle now, this indirection

-
-- multi: remove easy_handle struct field
-  
-  It isn't needed anymore
-
-- multi: remove 'Curl_one_easy' struct, phase 1
-  
-  The motivation for having a separate struct that keep track of an easy
-  handle when using the multi handle was removed when we switched to
-  always using the multi interface internally. Now they were just two
-  separate struct that was always allocated for each easy handle.
-  
-  This first step just moves the Curl_one_easy struct members into the
-  SessionHandle struct and hides this somehow (== keeps the source code
-  changes to a minimum) by defining Curl_one_easy to SessionHandle
-  
-  The biggest changes in this commit are:
-  
-   1 - the linked list of easy handles had to be changed somewhat due
-       to the new struct layout. This made the main linked list pointer
-       get renamed to 'easyp' and there's also a new pointer to the last
-       node, called easylp. It is no longer circular but ends with ->next
-       pointing to NULL. New nodes are still added last.
-  
-   2 - easy->state is now called easy->mstate to avoid name collision

+  curl: Add support for various DNS binding options.
   
-  These memory functions are solely used in Windows builds, so all related
-  code is protected with '#ifdef WIN32' preprocessor conditional compilation
-  directives.
+  (Passed on to c-ares.)
   
-  Specifically, wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used when building a Windows target with
-  UNICODE and USE_WINDOWS_SSPI preprocessor symbols defined. This is the case
-  when building a Windows UNICODE target with Windows native SSL/TLS support
-  enabled.
+  Allows something like this:
   
-  Realizing that wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used is a bit tricky given that usage
-  of these is hidden behind _tcsdup() which is MS way of dealing with code
-  that must tolerate UNICODE and non-UNICODE compilation. Additionally, MS
-  header files and those compatible from other compilers use this preprocessor
-  conditional compilation directive in order to select at compilation time
-  whether 'wide' or 'ansi' MS API functions are used.

-  Without this code, Windows build targets with Windows native SSL/TLS support

-  regardless of being a UNICODE enabled build or not.

-  When doing multi-part formposts, libcurl used a pseudo-random value that
-  was seeded with time(). This turns out to be bad for users who formpost
-  data that is provided with users who then can guess how the boundary
-  string will look like and then they can forge a different formpost part
-  and trick the receiver.
+  comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions
   
-  My advice to such implementors is (still even after this change) to not
-  rely on the boundary strings being cryptographically strong. Fix your
-  code and logic to not depend on them that much!
+  suggest parentheses around '&&' within '||' (twice)
+
+- curl: add --http1.1 and --http2.0 options
+
+- Curl_setopt: refuse CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0 if built without support
+
+- http2: add http2.[ch] and add nghttp2 version output
+
+- curl -V: output HTTP2 as a feature if present
+
+- curl.h: add CURL_VERSION_HTTP2 as a feature
   
-  I moved the Curl_rand() function into the sslgen.c source file now to be
-  able to take advantage of the SSL library's random function if it
-  provides one. If not, try to use the RANDOM_FILE for seeding and as a
-  last resort keep the old logic, just modified to also add microseconds
-  which makes it harder to properly guess the exact seed.
+  It isn't added as a separate protocol as HTTP2 will be done over HTTP://
+  URLs that can be upgraded to HTTP2 if the server supports it as well.

+- imap/smtp: Fixed incorrect SASL mechanism selection with XOAUTH2 servers
   
-  The formboundary() function in formdata.c is now using 64 bit entropy
-  for the boundary and therefore the string of dashes was reduced by 4
-  letters and there are 16 hex digits following it. The total length is
-  thus still the same.
+  XOAUTH2 would be selected in preference to LOGIN and PLAIN if the IMAP
+  or SMTP server advertised support for it even though a user's password
+  was supplied but bearer token wasn't.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1251
-  Reported-by: "Floris"
+  Modified the selection logic so that XOAUTH2 will only be selected if
+  the server supports it and A) The curl user/libcurl programmer has
+  specifically asked for XOAUTH via the ;AUTH=XOAUTH login option or 2)
+  The bearer token is specified. Obviously if XOAUTH is asked for via
+  the login option but no token is specified the user will receive a
+  authentication failure which makes more sense than no known
+  authentication mechanisms supported!
 
-- printf: make sure %x are treated unsigned
+Daniel Stenberg (4 Sep 2013)
+- curl.h: added CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0
   
-  When using %x, the number must be treated as unsigned as otherwise it

+  The commit 7b074a460b64811 to CURL_CHECK_CA_BUNDLE in 7.31 (don't check
+  for paths when cross-compiling) causes --without-ca-path to no longer
+  works when cross-compiling, since ca and capath only ever get set to
+  "no" when not cross-compiling, I attach a patch that works for me. Also
+  in the cross-compilation case, no ca-path seems to be a better default
+  (IMVHO) than empty ca-path.
   
-  The SessionHandle may not be around to use when we restore the sigpipe
-  sighandler so we store the no_signal boolean in the local struct to know
-  if/how to restore.

+- multi_socket: improved 100-continue timeout handling
   
-  Security problem: CVE-2013-2174
+  When waiting for a 100-continue response from the server, the
+  Curl_readwrite() will refuse to run if called until the timeout has been
+  reached.
   
-  If a program would give a string like "%FF" to curl_easy_unescape() but
-  ask for it to decode only the first byte, it would still parse and
-  decode the full hex sequence. The function then not only read beyond the
-  allowed buffer but it would also deduct the *unsigned* counter variable
-  for how many more bytes there's left to read in the buffer by two,
-  making the counter wrap. Continuing this, the function would go on
-  reading beyond the buffer and soon writing beyond the allocated target
-  buffer...
+  We timeout code in multi_socket() allows code to run slightly before the
+  actual timeout time, so for test 154 it could lead to the function being
+  executed but refused in Curl_readwrite() and then the application would
+  just sit idling forever.

-  true. curl_multi_wait() will sometimes return earlier without any file
-  descriptor to handle, just just because it is a suitable time to call
-  *perform().
+  This function is meant to work *exactly* as curl_easy_perform() but will
+  use the event-based libcurl API internally instead of
+  curl_multi_perform(). To avoid relying on an actual event-based library
+  and to not use non-portable functions (like epoll or similar), there's a
+  rather inefficient emulation layer implemented on top of Curl_poll()
+  instead.
   
-  This problem showed up with commit 29bf0598.

+  Curl_setopt: handle arbitrary-length username and password
   
-  If the multi handle's pending timeout is less than what is passed into
-  this function, it will now opt to use the shorter time anyway since it
-  is a very good hint that the handle wants to process something in a
-  shorter time than what otherwise would happen.
+  libcurl truncates usernames, passwords, and options set with
+  curl_easy_setopt to 255 (= MAX_CURL_PASSWORD_LENGTH - 1) characters.
+  This doesn't affect the return value from curl_easy_setopt(), so from

+  happened, except that authentication fails.

-  This is the reason for bug #1224

+- glob: error out on range overflow
   
-  We found that in specific cases if the connection is abruptly closed,
-  the underlying socket is listed in a close_wait state. We continue to
-  call the curl_multi_perform, curl_mutli_fdset etc. None of these APIs
-  report the socket closed / connection finished.  Since we have cases
-  where the multi connection is only used once, this can pose a problem
-  for us. I've read that if another connection was to come in, curl would
-  see the socket as bad and attempt to close it at that time -
-  unfortunately, this does not work for us.
+  The new multiply() function detects range value overflows. 32bit
+  machines will overflow on a 32bit boundary while 64bit hosts support
+  ranges up to the full 64 bit range.
   
-  I found that in specific situations, if SSL_write returns 0, curl did
-  not recognize the socket as closed (or errored out) and did not report
-  it to the application. I believe we need to change the code slightly, to
-  check if ssl_write returns 0. If so, treat it as an error - the same as
-  a negative return code.

-- smtp: Fixed unknown percentage complete in progress bar
+Guenter Knauf (5 Aug 2013)
+- Simplify check for trusted certificates.
   
-  The curl command line utility would display the the completed progress
-  bar with a percentage of zero as the progress routines didn't know the
-  size of the transfer.
+  This changes the previous check for untrusted certs to a check for
+  certs explicitely marked as trusted.
+  The change is backward-compatible (tested with certdata.txt v1.80).

-  Removed the hard returns from imap and pop3 by using the same style for
-  sending the authentication string as smtp. Moved the "Other mechanisms
-  not supported" check in smtp to match that of imap and pop3 to provide
-  consistency between the three email protocols.
+  Instead of claiming it is an error, we call it a "note" to reduce the

-  Users using the Secure Transport (darwinssl) back-end can now use a

-  Apple's security system is based around the keychain and does not have any
-  non-public function to create a SecIdentityRef data structure from data
-  loaded outside of the Keychain, the certificate and private key have to be
-  loaded into the Keychain first (using the certtool command line tool or
-  the Security framework's C API) before we can find it and use it.

+  doesn't exist anymore.

-- bump version
+- multi: remove 'Curl_one_easy' struct, phase 1
   
-  Since we're adding new stuff, the next release will bump the minor
-  version and we're looking forward to 7.31.0
+  The motivation for having a separate struct that keep track of an easy
+  handle when using the multi handle was removed when we switched to
+  always using the multi interface internally. Now they were just two
+  separate struct that was always allocated for each easy handle.
+  
+  This first step just moves the Curl_one_easy struct members into the
+  SessionHandle struct and hides this somehow (== keeps the source code
+  changes to a minimum) by defining Curl_one_easy to SessionHandle
+  
+  The biggest changes in this commit are:
+  
+   1 - the linked list of easy handles had to be changed somewhat due
+       to the new struct layout. This made the main linked list pointer
+       get renamed to 'easyp' and there's also a new pointer to the last
+       node, called easylp. It is no longer circular but ends with ->next
+       pointing to NULL. New nodes are still added last.
+  
+   2 - easy->state is now called easy->mstate to avoid name collision

-Daniel Stenberg (26 Apr 2013)
-- curl_easy_init: use less mallocs
+- curl: make --progress-bar update the line less frequently
   
-  By introducing an internal alternative to curl_multi_init() that accepts
-  parameters to set the hash sizes, easy handles will now use tiny socket
-  and connection hash tables since it will only ever add a single easy
-  handle to that multi handle.
+  Also, use memset() instead of a lame loop.
   
-  This decreased the number mallocs in test 40 (which is a rather simple
-  and typical easy interface use case) from 1142 to 138. The maximum
-  amount of memory allocated used went down from 118969 to 78805.
+  The previous logic that tried to avoid too many updates were very
+  ineffective for really fast transfers, as then it could easily end up
+  doing hundreds of updates per second that would make a significant

-
-- url: Re-factored set_userpass() and parse_url_userpass()
+  This new callback uses pure 'curl_off_t' arguments to pass on full
+  resolution sizes. It otherwise retains the same characteristics: the
+  same call rate, the same meanings for the arguments and the return code

-- smtp: Re-factored all perform based functions
+  This reverts commit 7ed25cc, reinstating commit 8ec2cb5.
   
-  Standardised the naming of all perform based functions to be in the form
-  smtp_perform_something().
+  As of 18-jul-2013 we still do have code in libcurl that makes use of these
+  memory functions. Commit 8ec2cb5 comment still applies and is yet valid.
+  
+  These memory functions are solely used in Windows builds, so all related
+  code is protected with '#ifdef WIN32' preprocessor conditional compilation
+  directives.
+  
+  Specifically, wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used when building a Windows target with
+  UNICODE and USE_WINDOWS_SSPI preprocessor symbols defined. This is the case
+  when building a Windows UNICODE target with Windows native SSL/TLS support
+  enabled.
+  
+  Realizing that wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used is a bit tricky given that usage
+  of these is hidden behind _tcsdup() which is MS way of dealing with code
+  that must tolerate UNICODE and non-UNICODE compilation. Additionally, MS
+  header files and those compatible from other compilers use this preprocessor
+  conditional compilation directive in order to select at compilation time
+  whether 'wide' or 'ansi' MS API functions are used.
+  
+  Without this code, Windows build targets with Windows native SSL/TLS support
+  enabled and MemoryTracking support enabled misbehave in tracking memory usage,
+  regardless of being a UNICODE enabled build or not.

+- formpost: better random boundaries
   
-  The previously applied patch didnt work on Windows; we cant rely
-  on shell commands like 'echo' since they act diffently on each
-  platform and each shell.
-  In order to keep this script platform-independent the code must
-  only use pure Perl.
+  When doing multi-part formposts, libcurl used a pseudo-random value that
+  was seeded with time(). This turns out to be bad for users who formpost
+  data that is provided with users who then can guess how the boundary
+  string will look like and then they can forge a different formpost part
+  and trick the receiver.
+  
+  My advice to such implementors is (still even after this change) to not
+  rely on the boundary strings being cryptographically strong. Fix your
+  code and logic to not depend on them that much!
+  
+  I moved the Curl_rand() function into the sslgen.c source file now to be
+  able to take advantage of the SSL library's random function if it
+  provides one. If not, try to use the RANDOM_FILE for seeding and as a
+  last resort keep the old logic, just modified to also add microseconds
+  which makes it harder to properly guess the exact seed.
+  
+  The formboundary() function in formdata.c is now using 64 bit entropy
+  for the boundary and therefore the string of dashes was reduced by 4
+  letters and there are 16 hex digits following it. The total length is
+  thus still the same.

-- FTP: wait on both connections during active STOR state
+- Curl_urldecode: no peeking beyond end of input buffer
   
-  When doing PORT and upload (STOR), this function needs to extract the
-  file descriptor for both connections so that it will respond immediately
-  when the server eventually connects back.
+  Security problem: CVE-2013-2174
   
-  This flaw caused active connections to become unnecessary slow but they
-  would still often work due to the normal polling on a timeout. The bug
-  also would not occur if the server connected back very fast, like when
-  testing on local networks.
+  If a program would give a string like "%FF" to curl_easy_unescape() but
+  ask for it to decode only the first byte, it would still parse and
+  decode the full hex sequence. The function then not only read beyond the
+  allowed buffer but it would also deduct the *unsigned* counter variable
+  for how many more bytes there's left to read in the buffer by two,
+  making the counter wrap. Continuing this, the function would go on
+  reading beyond the buffer and soon writing beyond the allocated target
+  buffer...

+- Use opened body.out file and write content to it.
 
-  connect: treat an interface bindlocal() problem as a non-fatal error
-  
-  I am using curl_easy_setopt(CURLOPT_INTERFACE, "if!something") to force
-  transfers to use a particular interface but the transfer fails with
-  CURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED, "Failed binding local connection end" if the
-  interface I specify has no IPv6 address. The cause is as follows:
-  
-  The remote hostname resolves successfully and has an IPv6 address and an
-  IPv4 address.
-  
-  cURL attempts to connect to the IPv6 address first.
-  
-  bindlocal (in lib/connect.c) fails because Curl_if2ip cannot find an
-  IPv6 address on the interface.
-  
-  This is a fatal error in singleipconnect()
-  
-  This change will make cURL try the next IP address in the list.
-  
-  Also included are two changes related to IPv6 address scope:
-  
-  - Filter the choice of address in Curl_if2ip to only consider addresses
-  with the same scope ID as the connection address (mismatched scope for
-  local and remote address does not result in a working connection).
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Jun 2013)
+- multi_socket: react on socket close immediately
   
-  - bindlocal was ignoring the scope ID of addresses returned by
-  Curl_if2ip . Now it uses them.
+  As a remedy to the problem when a socket gets closed and a new one is
+  opened with the same file descriptor number and as a result
+  multi.c:singlesocket() doesn't detect the difference, the new function
+  Curl_multi_closed() gets told when a socket is closed so that it can be
+  removed from the socket hash. When the old one has been removed, a new
+  socket should be detected fine by the singlesocket() on next invoke.

-- SO_SNDBUF: don't set SNDBUF for win32 versions vista or later
+- lib1500: remove bad check
   
-  The Microsoft knowledge-base article
-  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823764 describes how to use SNDBUF to
-  overcome a performance shortcoming in winsock, but it doesn't apply to
-  Windows Vista and later versions. If the described SNDBUF magic is
-  applied when running on those more recent Windows versions, it seems to
-  instead have the reversed effect in many cases and thus make libcurl
-  perform less good on those systems.
+  After curl_multi_wait() returns, this test checked that we got exactly
+  one file descriptor told to read from, but we cannot be sure that is
+  true. curl_multi_wait() will sometimes return earlier without any file
+  descriptor to handle, just just because it is a suitable time to call
+  *perform().
   
-  This fix thus adds a run-time version-check that does the SNDBUF magic
-  conditionally depending if it is deemed necessary or not.
+  This problem showed up with commit 29bf0598.

+  cookies: only consider full path matches
   
-  Accessing the library module name "tool_main" needs different handling
-  when the optional extended parsing is enabled.
+  I found a bug which cURL sends cookies to the path not to aim at.
+  For example:
+  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hoge/
+  - server returns cookie which with path=/hoge;
+    the point is there is NOT the '/' end of path string.
+  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hogege/ with the cookie.

-    2) Server responds with continuation respose "+ ...\r\n"
-    3) We start the transfer and send <size> bytes of data
-    4) Only now we end the request command line by sending "\r\n"
-    5) Server responds with "<tag> OK ...\r\n"
+  ... in case runtests.pl is invoked with non-default -b option
   
-  This commit performs steps 4 and 5, in the DONE phase, as more

-  imap: Added processing of the final FETCH responses
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Apr 2013)
+- test1217: verify parsing 257 responses with "rubbish" before path
   
-  Not processing the final FETCH responses was not optimal, not only
-  because the response code would be ignored but it would also leave data
-  unread on the socket which would prohibit connection reuse.
+  Test 1217 verifies commit e0fb2d86c9f78, and without that change this
+  test fails.

+- [Bill Middlecamp brought this change]
 
-  imap: Introduced FETCH_FINAL state for processing final fetch responses
+  FTP: handle "rubbish" in front of directory name in 257 responses
   
-  A typical FETCH response can be broken down into four parts:
+  When doing PWD, there's a 257 response which apparently some servers
+  prefix with a comment before the path instead of after it as is
+  otherwise the norm.
   
-    1) "* <uid> FETCH (<what> {<size>}\r\n", using continuation syntax
-    2) <size> bytes of the actual message
-    3) ")\r\n", finishing the untagged response
-    4) "<tag> OK ...", finishing the command
+  Failing to parse this, several otherwise legitimate use cases break.
   
-  Part 1 is read in imap_fetch_resp(), part 2 is consumed in the PERFORM
-  phase by the transfer subsystem, parts 3 and 4 are currently ignored.
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-04/0113.html

-  error: declaration of 'imap' shadows a previous local
+  The OpenSSL pipe wrote to the final CA bundle file, but the encoded PEM

-- smtp: Re-factored the final SMTP_AUTH constant

-- imap: Re-factored final IMAP_AUTHENTICATE constant
+Nick Zitzmann (8 Apr 2013)
+- darwinssl: disable insecure ciphers by default
   
-  Changed the final IMAP_AUTHENTICATE constant to IMAP_AUTHENTICATE_FINAL
-  for consistency with the response function.
+  I noticed that aria2's SecureTransport code disables insecure ciphers such
+  as NULL, anonymous, IDEA, and weak-key ciphers used by SSLv3 and later.
+  That's a good idea, and now we do the same thing in order to prevent curl
+  from accessing a "secure" site that only negotiates insecure ciphersuites.
 
-- imap: Updated the coding style of imap_state_servergreet_resp()

-
-- imap: Corrected char* references with char *
+  1 - We don't use the results from the test and we never did. recvfrom()

+- ftp.c: Added missing brackets around ABOR command logic
 
-- imap: Corrected comment in imap_endofresp()
+- sockfilt.c: Fixed detection of client-side connection close
+  
+  WINSOCK only:
+  Since FD_CLOSE is only signaled once, it may trigger at the same
+  time as FD_READ. Data actually being available makes it impossible
+  to detect that the connection was closed by checking that recv returns
+  zero. Another recv attempt could block the connection if it was

+- runtests.pl: Fixed --verbose parameter passed to http_pipe.py
 
-- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
+- sockfilt.c: Reduce CPU load while running under a Windows PIPE
 
-  imap: Added a helper function for upcoming untagged response filtering
-  
-  RFC 3501 states that "the client MUST be prepared to accept any response
-  at all times" yet we assume anything received with "* " at the beginning
-  is the untagged response we want.

+  Test 591 and 592 are updated accordingly.
 
-- smtp: Removed bytecountp from the per-request structure
+- FTP: wait on both connections during active STOR state
+  
+  When doing PORT and upload (STOR), this function needs to extract the
+  file descriptor for both connections so that it will respond immediately
+  when the server eventually connects back.
+  
+  This flaw caused active connections to become unnecessary slow but they
+  would still often work due to the normal polling on a timeout. The bug
+  also would not occur if the server connected back very fast, like when
+  testing on local networks.
   
-  Removed this pointer to a downloaded bytes counter because it was set in

-  From a maintenance point of view the code reads better to view tagged

+  - Filter the choice of address in Curl_if2ip to only consider addresses

-  Additionally, this matches the order of responses in POP3.

+- WIN32 MemoryTracking: track wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() usage
   
-  A simple function to test whether the PP is not sending and there are
-  still more data in its receiver cache. This will be later utilized to:
+  As of 25-mar-2013 wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() are only used in
+  WIN32 specific code, so tracking of these has not been extended for
+  other build targets. Without this fix, memory tracking system on
+  WIN32 builds, when using these functions, would provide misleading
+  results.
   
-  1) Change Curl_pp_multi_statemach() and Curl_pp_easy_statemach() to
-     not test socket state and just call user's statemach_act() function
-     when there are more data to process, because otherwise the task would
-     just hang, waiting for more data from the socket.
+  In order to properly extend this support for all targets curl.h
+  would have to define curl_wcsdup_callback prototype and consequently
+  wchar_t should be visible before that in curl.h.  IOW curl_wchar_t
+  defined in curlbuild.h and this pulling whatever system header is
+  required to get wchar_t definition.
   
-  2) Allow PP users to read multiple responses by looping as long as there
-     are more data available and current phase is not finished.
-     (Currently needed for correct processing of IMAP SELECT responses.)
+  Additionally a new curl_global_init_mem() function that also receives
+  user defined wcsdup() callback would be required.

-  This function was only used twice, both in places where performance
-  isn't crucial (socks + if2ip). Removing the use of this function removes
-  the need to have our private version for systems without it == reduced
-  amount of code.
+  Introducing a number of options to the multi interface that
+  allows for multiple pipelines to the same host, in order to
+  optimize the balance between the penalty for opening new
+  connections and the potential pipelining latency.
   
-  Also, in the SOCKS case it is clearly better to fail gracefully rather
-  than to truncate the results.
+  Two new options for limiting the number of connections:
   
-  This work was triggered by a bug report on the strcal prototype in
-  strequal.h.
+  CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of running connections
+  to the same host. When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
+  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
+  finished, so we can reuse the connection.
   
-  strlcat was added in commit db70cd28 in February 2001!
+  CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of connections in total.
+  When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
+  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
+  finished. The free connection will then be reused, if possible, or
+  closed if the pending handle can't reuse it.

+  If not, the handle will be put in a pending state until a connection is
+  ready (either free or a pipe got shorter).

-- sasl: Fixed null pointer reference when decoding empty digest challenge
+  tool_main.c: fix VMS global variable storage-class specifier
   
-  Fixed a null pointer reference when an empty challenge is passed to the
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() function.
+  An extern submits a psect and a global reference to the linker to point
+  to it. Using "extern int vms_show = 0" also creates a globaldef.
   
-  Bug: http://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1193/
-  Reported by: Saran Neti
+  The use of the extern by itself does declare a psect but does not declare
+  a globalsymbol. It does declare a globalref. But the linker needs one and
+  only one globaldef or there is an error.

-- darwinssl: Fix send glitchiness with data > 32 or so KB
+  curl_global_init: accept the CURL_GLOBAL_ACK_EINTR flag
   
-  An ambiguity in the SSLWrite() documentation lead to a bad inference in the
-  code where we assumed SSLWrite() returned the amount of bytes written to
-  the socket, when that is not actually true; it returns the amount of data
-  that is buffered for writing to the socket if it returns errSSLWouldBlock.
-  Now darwinssl_send() returns CURLE_AGAIN if data is buffered but not written.
+  The flag can be used in pycurl-based applications where using the multi
+  interface would not be acceptable because of the performance lost caused
+  by implementing the select() loop in python.

-- pingpong: Optimised the endofresp() function
+Yang Tse (12 Mar 2013)
+- curl.h: stricter CURL_EXTERN linkage decorations logic
   
-  Reworked the pp->endofresp() function so that the conndata, line and
-  line length are passed down to it just as with Curl_client_write()
-  rather than each implementation of the function having to query
-  these values.
+  No API change involved.
   
-  Additionally changed the int return type to bool as this is more
-  representative of the function's usage.
