+- schannel: schannel_recv overhaul
+  
+  This commit is several drafts squashed together. The changes from each
+  draft are noted below. If any changes are similar and possibly
+  contradictory the change in the latest draft takes precedence.
+  
+  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/issues/244
+  Reported-by: Chris Araman
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 1
+  %%
+  - return 0 if len == 0. that will have to be documented.
+  - continue on and process the caches regardless of raw recv
+  - if decrypted data will be returned then set the error code to CURLE_OK
+  and return its count
+  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection has closed
+  (eg nread == 0) then return 0 and CURLE_OK
+  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection *hasn't*
+  closed then set the error code to CURLE_AGAIN --only if an error code
+  isn't already set-- and return -1
+  - narrow the Win2k workaround to only Win2k
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 2
+  %%
+  - Trying out a change in flow to handle corner cases.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 3
+  %%
+  - Back out the lazier decryption change made in draft2.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 4
+  %%
+  - Some formatting and branching changes
+  - Decrypt all encrypted cached data when len == 0
+  - Save connection closed state
+  - Change special Win2k check to use connection closed state
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 5
+  %%
+  - Default to CURLE_AGAIN in cleanup if an error code wasn't set and the
+  connection isn't closed.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 6
+  %%
+  - Save the last error only if it is an unrecoverable error.
+  
+  Prior to this I saved the last error state in all cases; unfortunately
+  the logic to cover that in all cases would lead to some muddle and I'm
+  concerned that could then lead to a bug in the future so I've replaced
+  it by only recording an unrecoverable error and that state will persist.
+  
+  - Do not recurse on renegotiation.
+  
+  Instead we'll continue on to process any trailing encrypted data
+  received during the renegotiation only.
+  
+  - Move the err checks in cleanup after the check for decrypted data.
+  
+  In either case decrypted data is always returned but I think it's easier
+  to understand when those err checks come after the decrypted data check.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 7
+  %%
+  - Regardless of len value go directly to cleanup if there is an
+  unrecoverable error or a close_notify was already received. Prior to
+  this change we only acknowledged those two states if len != 0.
+  
+  - Fix a bug in connection closed behavior: Set the error state in the
+  cleanup, because we don't know for sure it's an error until that time.
+  
+  - (Related to above) In the case the connection is closed go "greedy"
+  with the decryption to make sure all remaining encrypted data has been
+  decrypted even if it is not needed at that time by the caller. This is
+  necessary because we can only tell if the connection closed gracefully
+  (close_notify) once all encrypted data has been decrypted.
+  
+  - Do not renegotiate when an unrecoverable error is pending.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 8
+  %%
+  - Don't show 'server closed the connection' info message twice.
+  
+  - Show an info message if server closed abruptly (missing close_notify).

-  When doing HTTP requests Negotiate authenticated, the entire connnection

-  hood. curl was not adhering to this fact but would assume that such

+  schannel: Add support for optional client certificates
   
-  If a URL is given with a zero-length host name, like in "http://:80" or
-  just ":80", `fix_hostname()` will index the host name pointer with a -1
-  offset (as it blindly assumes a non-zero length) and both read and
-  assign that address.
+  Some servers will request a client certificate, but not require one.
+  This change allows libcurl to connect to such servers when using
+  schannel as its ssl/tls backend. When a server requests a client
+  certificate, libcurl will now continue the handshake without one,
+  rather than terminating the handshake. The server can then decide
+  if that is acceptable or not. Prior to this change, libcurl would
+  terminate the handshake, reporting a SEC_I_INCOMPLETE_CREDENTIALS
+  error.

-- cookie: cookie parser out of boundary memory access
-  
-  The internal libcurl function called sanitize_cookie_path() that cleans
-  up the path element as given to it from a remote site or when read from
-  a file, did not properly validate the input. If given a path that
-  consisted of a single double-quote, libcurl would index a newly
-  allocated memory area with index -1 and assign a zero to it, thus
-  destroying heap memory it wasn't supposed to.

+Daniel Stenberg (25 May 2015)
+- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]
+
+  http2: Copy data passed in Curl_http2_switched into HTTP/2 connection buffer
   
-  CyaSSL >= 2.6.0 may have an options.h that was generated during
-  its build by configure.
+  Previously, after seeing upgrade to HTTP/2, we feed data followed by
+  upgrade response headers directly to nghttp2_session_mem_recv() in
+  Curl_http2_switched().  But it turns out that passed buffer, mem, is
+  part of stream->mem, and callbacks called by
+  nghttp2_session_mem_recv() will write stream specific data into
+  stream->mem, overwriting input data.  This will corrupt input, and
+  most likely frame length error is detected by nghttp2 library.  The
+  fix is first copy the passed data to HTTP/2 connection buffer,
+  httpc->inbuf, and call nghttp2_session_mem_recv().

-  cyassl: Set minimum protocol version before CTX callback
+  http2: Faster http2 upload
   
-  This change is to allow the user's CTX callback to change the minimum
-  protocol version in the CTX without us later overriding it, as we did
-  prior to this change.
+  Previously, when we send all given buffer in data_source_callback, we
+  return NGHTTP2_ERR_DEFERRED, and nghttp2 library removes this stream
+  temporarily for writing.  This itself is good.  If this is the sole
+  stream in the session, nghttp2_session_want_write() returns zero,
+  which means that libcurl does not check writeability of the underlying
+  socket.  This leads to very slow upload, because it seems curl only
+  upload 16k something per 1 second.  To fix this, if we still have data
+  to send, call nghttp2_session_resume_data after nghttp2_session_send.
+  This makes nghttp2_session_want_write() returns nonzero (if connection
+  window still opens), and as a result, socket writeability is checked,
+  and upload speed becomes normal.

+  DATA, and stream->closed becomes true at the same time.  Previously,
+  in this condition, after we processed DATA, we are going to try to
+  read data from underlying transport, but there is no data, and gets
+  EAGAIN.  There was no code path to evaludate stream->closed.

-  This fixes a build failure where openssl and libmetalink are used

-- free: instead of Curl_safefree()
-  
-  Since we just started make use of free(NULL) in order to simplify code,
-  this change takes it a step further and:
+Daniel Stenberg (22 Apr 2015)
+- connectionexists: follow-up to fd9d3a1ef1f
   
-  - converts lots of Curl_safefree() calls to good old free()
-  - makes Curl_safefree() not check the pointer before free()
+  PROTOPT_CREDSPERREQUEST still needs to be checked even when NTLM is not
+  enabled.
   
-  The (new) rule of thumb is: if you really want a function call that
-  frees a pointer and then assigns it to NULL, then use Curl_safefree().
-  But we will prefer just using free() from now on.

-  connect: Fix happy eyeballs logic for IPv4-only builds
-  
-  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/168
-  
-  (trynextip)
-  - Don't try the "other" protocol family unless IPv6 is available. In an
-  IPv4-only build the other family can only be IPv6 which is unavailable.
-  
-  This change essentially stops IPv4-only builds from attempting the
-  "happy eyeballs" secondary parallel connection that is supposed to be
-  used by the "other" address family.
-  
-  Prior to this change in IPv4-only builds that secondary parallel
-  connection attempt could be erroneously used by the same family (IPv4)
-  which caused a bug where every address after the first for a host could
-  be tried twice, often in parallel. This change fixes that bug. An
-  example of the bug is shown below.
-  
-  Assume MTEST resolves to 3 addresses 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 and 127.0.0.4:
-  
-  * STATE: INIT => CONNECT handle 0x64f4b0; line 1046 (connection #-5000)
-  * Rebuilt URL to: http://MTEST/
-  * Added connection 0. The cache now contains 1 members
-  * STATE: CONNECT => WAITRESOLVE handle 0x64f4b0; line 1083
-  (connection #0)
-  *   Trying 127.0.0.2...
-  * STATE: WAITRESOLVE => WAITCONNECT handle 0x64f4b0; line 1163
-  (connection #0)
-  *   Trying 127.0.0.3...
-  * connect to 127.0.0.2 port 80 failed: Connection refused
-  *   Trying 127.0.0.3...
-  * connect to 127.0.0.3 port 80 failed: Connection refused

-  * connect to 127.0.0.4 port 80 failed: Connection refused
-  * connect to 127.0.0.4 port 80 failed: Connection refused
-  * Failed to connect to MTEST port 80: Connection refused
-  * Closing connection 0
-  * The cache now contains 0 members
-  * Expire cleared
-  curl: (7) Failed to connect to MTEST port 80: Connection refused

-  closesocket: call multi socket cb on close even with custom close
-  
-  In function Curl_closesocket() in connect.c the call to
-  Curl_multi_closed() was wrongly omitted if a socket close function
-  (CURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETFUNCTION) is registered.
-  
-  That would lead to not removing the socket from the internal hash table

-  hostip: Fix signal race in Curl_resolv_timeout.
-  
-  A signal handler for SIGALRM is installed in Curl_resolv_timeout. It is
-  configured to interrupt system calls and uses siglongjmp to return into
-  the function if alarm() goes off.
+- http_done: close Negotiate connections when done
   
-  The signal handler is installed before curl_jmpenv is initialized.
-  This means that an already installed alarm timer could trigger the
-  newly installed signal handler, leading to undefined behavior when it
-  accesses the uninitialized curl_jmpenv.
+  When doing HTTP requests Negotiate authenticated, the entire connnection
+  may become authenticated and not just the specific HTTP request which is
+  otherwise how HTTP works, as Negotiate can basically use NTLM under the
+  hood. curl was not adhering to this fact but would assume that such
+  requests would also be authenticated per request.
   
-  Even if there is no previously installed alarm available, the code in
-  Curl_resolv_timeout itself installs an alarm before the environment is
-  fully set up. If the process is sent into suspend right after that, the
-  signal handler could be called too early as in previous scenario.
+  CVE-2015-3148
   
-  To fix this, the signal handler should only be installed and the alarm
-  timer only be set after sigsetjmp has been called.

+  If a URL is given with a zero-length host name, like in "http://:80" or

+  a file, did not properly validate the input. If given a path that

+  lib/transfer.c: Remove factor of 8 from sleep time calculation
   
-  SSLeay was the name of the library that was subsequently turned into
-  OpenSSL many moons ago (1999). curl does not work with the old SSLeay
-  library since years. This is now reflected by only using USE_OPENSSL in
-  code that depends on OpenSSL.
+  The factor of 8 is a bytes-to-bits conversion factor, but pkt_size and
+  rate_bps are both in bytes. When using the rate limiting option, curl
+  waits 8 times too long, and then transfers very quickly until the
+  average rate reaches the limit. The average rate follows the limit over
+  time, but the actual traffic is bursty.

+  cyassl: Fix certificate load check
   
-  ... to avoid a build failure when configured with --enable-debug
+  SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations can return negative values on fail,
+  therefore to check for failure we check if load is != 1 (success)
+  instead of if load is == 0 (failure), the latter being incorrect given
+  that behavior.

-  http2: Return error if stream was closed with other than NO_ERROR
+  http2: Fix missing nghttp2_session_send call in Curl_http2_switched
   
-  Previously, we just ignored error code passed to
-  on_stream_close_callback and just return 0 (success) after stream
-  closure even if stream was reset with error.  This patch records error
-  code in on_stream_close_callback, and return -1 and use CURLE_HTTP2
-  error code on abnormal stream closure.
-
-- tool: Updated the warnf() function to use the GlobalConfig structure
+  Previously in Curl_http2_switched, we called nghttp2_session_mem_recv to
+  parse incoming data which were already received while curl was handling
+  upgrade.  But we didn't call nghttp2_session_send, and it led to make
+  curl not send any response to the received frames.  Most likely, we
+  received SETTINGS from server at this point, so we missed opportunity to
+  send SETTINGS + ACK.  This commit adds missing nghttp2_session_send call
+  in Curl_http2_switched to fix this issue.
   
-  As the 'error' and 'mute' options are now part of the GlobalConfig,
-  rather than per Operation, updated the warnf() function to use this
-  structure rather than the OperationConfig.

+  cyassl: Fix library initialization return value
   
-  Visual Studio 2008 introduced support for the address space layout
-  randomization (ASLR) feature of Windows Vista. However, upgrading the
-  VC8 project files to VC9 and above disabled this feature.
+  (Curl_cyassl_init)
+  - Return 1 on success, 0 in failure.
   
-  Removed the RandomizedBaseAddress directive to enabled the default
-  setting (/DYNAMICBASE). Note: This doesn't appear to have any negative
-  impact when compiled and ran on Windows XP.
+  Prior to this change the fail path returned an incorrect value and the
+  evaluation to determine whether CyaSSL_Init had succeeded was incorrect.
+  Ironically that combined with the way curl_global_init tests SSL library
+  initialization (!Curl_ssl_init()) meant that CyaSSL having been
+  successfully initialized would be seen as that even though the code path
+  and return value in Curl_cyassl_init were wrong.

-  Pointed-out-by: Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa

+  Icecast versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.12 would reply with "ICY 200"
+  under certain conditions:
+  
+      client_wants_icy_headers (connection_t *con)

+                      return 1;
+  
+              return 0;
+      }
+  
+  So mainly if there is no 'user agent' or it is '(null)' or contains
+  'winamp' or 'Shoutcast'.
+  
+  No mainstream distribution carries Icecast 1.3.x anymore, after all
+  it was released in 2002 and superseded by Icecast 2.x.

+  cyassl: add SSL context callback support for CyaSSL
   
-  obj_count can be 1 if the custom read function is set or the stdin
-  handle is a reference to a pipe. Since the pipe should be handled
-  using the PeekNamedPipe-check below, the custom read function should
-  only be used if it is actually enabled.

-- telnet.c: fix handling of 0 being returned from custom read function

-  timeval: typecast for better type (on Amiga)
+  hostip: Fix signal race in Curl_resolv_timeout.
   
-  There is an issue with conflicting "struct timeval" definitions with
-  certain AmigaOS releases and C libraries, depending on what gets
-  included when.  It's a minor difference - the OS one is unsigned,
-  whereas the common structure has signed elements.  If the OS one ends up
-  getting defined, this causes a timing calculation error in curl.
+  A signal handler for SIGALRM is installed in Curl_resolv_timeout. It is
+  configured to interrupt system calls and uses siglongjmp to return into
+  the function if alarm() goes off.
   
-  It's easy enough to resolve this at the curl end, by casting the
-  potentially errorneous calculation to a signed long.
-
-- openssl: do public key pinning check independently
+  The signal handler is installed before curl_jmpenv is initialized.
+  This means that an already installed alarm timer could trigger the
+  newly installed signal handler, leading to undefined behavior when it
+  accesses the uninitialized curl_jmpenv.
   
-  ... of the other cert verification checks so that you can set verifyhost
-  and verifypeer to FALSE and still check the public key.
+  Even if there is no previously installed alarm available, the code in
+  Curl_resolv_timeout itself installs an alarm before the environment is
+  fully set up. If the process is sent into suspend right after that, the
+  signal handler could be called too early as in previous scenario.

-  url: add CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS option
+- multi: fix *getsock() with CONNECT
   
-  This option can be used to enable/disable certificate status verification using
-  the "Certificate Status Request" TLS extension defined in RFC6066 section 8.
+  The code used some happy eyeballs logic even _after_ CONNECT has been
+  sent to a proxy, while the happy eyeball phase is already (should be)
+  over by then.
   
-  This also adds the CURLE_SSL_INVALIDCERTSTATUS error, to be used when the
-  certificate status verification fails, and the Curl_ssl_cert_status_request()
-  function, used to check whether the SSL backend supports the status_request
-  extension.
+  This is solved by splitting the multi state into two separate states
+  introducing the new SENDPROTOCONNECT state.

+  curl.1: --cert-status is also supported by OpenSSL now
 
-- vtls: Use '(void) arg' for unused parameters
+- build: Removed Visual Studio SuppressStartupBanner directive for VC8+
   
-  Prefer void for unused parameters, rather than assigning an argument to
-  itself as a) unintelligent compilers won't optimize it out, b) it can't
-  be used for const parameters, c) it will cause compilation warnings for
-  clang with -Wself-assign and d) is inconsistent with other areas of the
-  curl source code.
+  Visual Studio 2005 and above defaults to disabling the startup banner
+  for the Compiler, Linker and MIDL tools (with /NOLOGO). As such there
+  is no need to explicitly set the SuppressStartupBanner directive, as
+  this is a leftover from the VC7 and VC7.1 projects being upgraded to
+  VC8 and above.

+  In preparation for adding the test suite and examples projects renamed
+  the top level "all" solution files to better describe what they are.
   
-  Also fix possible thread handle leak in CloseHandle-loop.

-  
-  Improves performance of test cases 574 and 575 by 50%.
+- build: Enabled DEBUGBUILD in Visual Studio debug builds
   
-  A value of zero causes the thread to relinquish the remainder
-  of its time slice to any other thread of equal priority that is
-  ready to run. If there are no other threads of equal priority
-  ready to run, the function returns immediately, and the thread
-  continues execution.
+  Defined the DEBUGBUILD pre-processor variable to allow extra logging,
+  which is particularly useful in debug builds, as we use this and Visual
+  Studio typically uses _DEBUG.
   
-  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686307.aspx
+  We could define DEBUBBUILD, in curl_setup.h, when _MSC_VER and _DEBUG is
+  defined but that would also affect the makefile based builds which we
+  probably don't want to do.

-- build: Removed WIN64 definition from the libcurl Visual Studio projects
-  
-  Removed the WIN64 pre-processor definition from the libcurl project
-  files as:
-  
-  * WIN64 is not used in our source code
-  * The curl projects files don't define it
-  * It isn't required by or used in the platform SDK
-  * For backwards compatability curl_setup.h defines WIN32
-  * The compiler automatically defines _WIN64 for x64 builds
-  
-  Historically Visual Studio projects have defined WIN32, in addition to
-  the compiler defined _WIN32 definition, and I had incorrectly changed
-  that to WIN64 for the x64 libcurl builds but not in the curl projects.
-  
-  As such, it is questionable whether this should be defined or not. For

-- IPV6: address scope != scope id
-  There was a confusion between these: this commit tries to disambiguate them.
-  - Scope can be computed from the address itself.
-  - Scope id is scope dependent: it is currently defined as 1-based local
-    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
-    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
-    addresses.
-  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
-  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
-  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
-  to bind to an interface.
-  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
-  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
-  the interface index.
-  
-  This commit should fix SF bug #1451.

+- [Chris Young brought this change]
+
+  timeval: typecast for better type (on Amiga)
   
-  Change CURLOPT_TIMEOUT doc to warn that if CURLOPT_TIMEOUT and
-  CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS are both set whichever one is set last is the one
-  that will be used.
+  There is an issue with conflicting "struct timeval" definitions with
+  certain AmigaOS releases and C libraries, depending on what gets
+  included when.  It's a minor difference - the OS one is unsigned,
+  whereas the common structure has signed elements.  If the OS one ends up
+  getting defined, this causes a timing calculation error in curl.
   
-  Prior to this change that behavior was only noted in the
-  CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS doc.
+  It's easy enough to resolve this at the curl end, by casting the
+  potentially errorneous calculation to a signed long.

-  libcurl: add UNIX domain sockets support
-  
-  The ability to do HTTP requests over a UNIX domain socket has been
-  requested before, in Apr 2008 [0][1] and Sep 2010 [2]. While a
-  discussion happened, no patch seems to get through. I decided to give it
-  a go since I need to test a nginx HTTP server which listens on a UNIX
-  domain socket.
-  
-  One patch [3] seems to make it possible to use the
-  CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION function to gain a UNIX domain socket.
-  Another person wrote a Go program which can do HTTP over a UNIX socket
-  for Docker[4] which uses a special URL scheme (though the name contains
-  cURL, it has no relation to the cURL library).
+- schannel: Moved the ISC return flag definitions to the SSPI module
   
-  This patch considers support for UNIX domain sockets at the same level
-  as HTTP proxies / IPv6, it acts as an intermediate socket provider and
-  not as a separate protocol. Since this feature affects network
-  operations, a new feature flag was added ("unix-sockets") with a
-  corresponding CURL_VERSION_UNIX_SOCKETS macro.
+  Moved our Initialize Security Context return attribute definitions to
+  the SSPI module, as a) these can be used by other SSPI based providers
+  and b) the ISC required attributes are defined there.
+

+
+  smb: Close the connection after a failed client write
+
+- darwinssl: Fixed compilation warning

-  handle (replacing IP sockets and skipping proxies).
+  vtls.c:683:43: warning: unused parameter 'data'
+
+- sockfilt.c: Fixed compilation warnings
   
-  A new configure option (--enable-unix-sockets) and CMake option
-  (ENABLE_UNIX_SOCKETS) can disable this optional feature. Note that I
-  deliberately did not mark this feature as advanced, this is a
-  feature/component that should easily be available.

+  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN and others simply returned zero, but in all cases the
+  return code was ignored by the calling function Curl_ssl_close_all().
   
-  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
+  For the time being and to keep the internal API consistent, changed all
+  declarations to use a void return type.
+  
+  To reduce code we might want to consider removing the unimplemented
+  versions and use a void #define like schannel does.

-  Instead of depending the socket domain type on use_ipv6, specify the

+  The return type for this function was 0 on success and 1 on error. This
+  was then examined by the calling functions and, in most cases, used to
+  return CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY.
   
-  Besides abstracting the socket type, make the debugging messages be
-  independent on IP (introduce location_str which points to "port XXXXX").
-  Rename "ipv_inuse" to "socket_type" and tighten the scope (main).

-Steve Holme (30 Nov 2014)
-- version: The next release will become 7.40.0
-
-- [Bill Nagel brought this change]
+  In line with the other features listed in the --version output,
+  capitalise the UNIX socket feature.
 
-  docs: Updated for the SMB protocol
+- vtls: Use bool for Curl_ssl_getsessionid() return type
   
-  This patch updates the documentation for the SMB/CIFS protocol.
+  The return type of this function is a boolean value, and even uses a
+  bool internally, so use bool in the function declaration as well as
+  the variables that store the return value, to avoid any confusion.

-- [Bill Nagel brought this change]
+- openssl: Prefer we don't use NULL in comparisons
 
-  smb: Added initial SMB functionality
+- build: Removed WIN32 definition from the Visual Studio projects
   
-  Initial implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol.
-
-- [Bill Nagel brought this change]
+  As this pre-processor definition is defined in curl_setup.h there is no
+  need to include it in the Visual Studio project files.
 
-  smb: Added SMB handler interfaces
+- build: Removed WIN64 definition from the libcurl Visual Studio projects
   
-  Added the SMB and SMBS handler interface structures and associated
-  functions required for SMB/CIFS operation.
-
-- transfer: Code style policing
+  Removed the WIN64 pre-processor definition from the libcurl project
+  files as:
   
-  Prefer ! rather than NULL in if statements, added comments and updated
-  function spacing, argument spacing and line spacing to be more readble.
-
-- transfer: Fixed existing scratch buffer being checked for NULL twice
+  * WIN64 is not used in our source code
+  * The curl projects files don't define it
+  * It isn't required by or used in the platform SDK
+  * For backwards compatability curl_setup.h defines WIN32
+  * The compiler automatically defines _WIN64 for x64 builds
   
-  If the scratch buffer already existed when the CRLF conversion was
-  performed then the buffer pointer would be checked twice for NULL. This
-  second check is only necessary if the call to malloc() was performed by
-  the first check.
-
-- smtp: Fixed dot stuffing being performed when no new data read
+  Historically Visual Studio projects have defined WIN32, in addition to
+  the compiler defined _WIN32 definition, and I had incorrectly changed
+  that to WIN64 for the x64 libcurl builds but not in the curl projects.
   
-  Whilst I had moved the dot stuffing code from being performed before
-  CRLF conversion takes place to after it, in commit 4bd860a001, I had
-  moved it outside the 'when something read' block of code when meant
-  it could perform the dot stuffing twice on partial send if nread
-  happened to contain the right values. It also meant the function could
-  potentially read past the end of buffer. This was highlighted by the
-  following warning:
+  As such, it is questionable whether this should be defined or not. For
+  more information see the following cache of a discussion that took
+  place on the microsoft.public.vc.mfc newsgroup:
   
-  warning: `nread' might be used uninitialized in this function

-  runtests.pl: fix startup of IPv6 servers
+Marc Hoersken (21 Dec 2014)
+- sockfilt.c: use non-Ex functions that are available before WinXP
   
-  Commit curl-7_23_1-143-g8218064 changed the parameter of
-  responsive_http_server to accept types other than IPv6 (converting
-  from a boolean to a string), but only considered the lower-case "ipv6"
-  and not the "IPv6" variant. This caused all servers to start in IPv4
-  mode instead.
+  It was initially reported by Guenter that GetFileSizeEx
+  requires (_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0500) to be true.
+
+- tests: use Cygwin-style paths in SSH, SSHD and SFTP config files
   
-  This patch converts the remaining cases to "ipv6". While not strictly
-  necessary for the run*server variants, these got also converted for
-  consistency and to prevent future errors.
+  Second patch to enable Windows support using Cygwin-based OpenSSH.
   
-  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
+  Tested with CopSSH 5.0.0 free edition using an msys shell on Windows 7.

+- tests: support spaces in paths to SSH, SSHD and SFTP binaries
+  
+  First patch to enable Windows support using Cygwin-based OpenSSH.
 
-  runtests.pl: fix warning message, remove duplicate value
+Steve Holme (20 Dec 2014)
+- non-ascii: Reduce variable usage
   
-  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
+  Removed 'next' variable in Curl_convert_form(). Rather than setting it
+  from 'form->next' and using that to set 'form' after the conversion
+  just use 'form = form->next' instead.
 
-Steve Holme (27 Nov 2014)
-- http.c: Fixed compilation warnings from features being disabled
+- non-ascii: Prefer while loop rather than a do loop
   
-  warning: unused variable 'data'
-  warning: variable 'addcookies' set but not used
+  This also removes the need to check that the 'form' argument is valid.
+
+- non-ascii: Reduce variable scope
   
-  ...and some very minor coding style policing.
+  As 'result' isn't used out side the conversion callback code and
+  previously caused variable shadowing in the libiconv based code.
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with c5399c827d
+- non-ascii: We prefer 'CURLcode result'
+  
+  This also fixes a variable shadowing issue when HAVE_ICONV is defined
+  as rc was declared for the result code of libiconv based functions.

+  parseurlandfillconn(): fix improper non-numeric scope_id stripping.
+  Fixes SF bug 1149: http://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1449/
 
-- libcurl.3: fix formatting
+- IPV6: address scope != scope id
+  There was a confusion between these: this commit tries to disambiguate them.
+  - Scope can be computed from the address itself.
+  - Scope id is scope dependent: it is currently defined as 1-based local
+    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
+    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
+    addresses.
+  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
+  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
+  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
+  to bind to an interface.
+  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
+  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
+  the interface index.
   
-  refer to functions with the man page section properly
+  This commit should fix SF bug #1451.

-  This makes it much easier to run multiple tests in the same directory,

+  There was a mix of GlobCode, CURLcode and ints and they were mostly
+  passing around CURLcode errors. This change makes the functions use only
+  CURLcode and removes the GlobCode type completely.

-  CMake: Simplify if() conditions on check result variables
+- smtp: Fixed dot stuffing when EOL characters were at end of input buffers
   
-  Remove use of an old hack that takes advantage of the auto-dereference

-  hack has the form:
+  Fixed a problem with the CRLF. detection when multiple buffers were
+  used to upload an email to libcurl and the line ending character(s)
+  appeared at the end of each buffer. This meant any lines which started
+  with . would not be escaped into .. and could be interpreted as the end
+  of transmission string instead.
   
-   if("${VAR} MATCHES "^${VAR}$")
+  This only affected libcurl based applications that used a read function
+  and wasn't reproducible with the curl command-line tool.
   
-  where "${VAR}" is a macro argument reference.  Use if(DEFINED) instead.
-  This also avoids warnings for CMake Policy CMP0054 in CMake 3.1.

+  libcurl: add UNIX domain sockets support
+  
+  The ability to do HTTP requests over a UNIX domain socket has been
+  requested before, in Apr 2008 [0][1] and Sep 2010 [2]. While a
+  discussion happened, no patch seems to get through. I decided to give it
+  a go since I need to test a nginx HTTP server which listens on a UNIX
+  domain socket.
+  
+  One patch [3] seems to make it possible to use the
+  CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION function to gain a UNIX domain socket.
+  Another person wrote a Go program which can do HTTP over a UNIX socket
+  for Docker[4] which uses a special URL scheme (though the name contains
+  cURL, it has no relation to the cURL library).
   
-  I noticed that a patched cmake build would pass tests with a fake local
-  hostname, but the autotools build skips them:
+  This patch considers support for UNIX domain sockets at the same level
+  as HTTP proxies / IPv6, it acts as an intermediate socket provider and
+  not as a separate protocol. Since this feature affects network
+  operations, a new feature flag was added ("unix-sockets") with a
+  corresponding CURL_VERSION_UNIX_SOCKETS macro.
   
-      got unexpected host name back, LD_PRELOAD failed
+  A new CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH option is added and documented. This
+  option enables UNIX domain sockets support for all requests on the
+  handle (replacing IP sockets and skipping proxies).
   
-  It turns out that -fvisibility=hidden hides the symbol, and since the
-  tests are not part of libcurl, it fails too. Just remove the LIBCURL
-  guard.
+  A new configure option (--enable-unix-sockets) and CMake option
+  (ENABLE_UNIX_SOCKETS) can disable this optional feature. Note that I
+  deliberately did not mark this feature as advanced, this is a
+  feature/component that should easily be available.
   
-  Broken since cURL 7.30 (commit 83a42ee20ea7fc25abb61c0b7ef56ebe712d7093,
-  "curl.h: stricter CURL_EXTERN linkage decorations logic").

-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1448
-
-Steve Holme (9 Nov 2014)
-- INSTALL: Updated pre-processor references to the old VC6 project files
+  If sws is killed it might leave a stale socket file on the filesystem
+  which would cause an EADDRINUSE error. After this patch, it is checked
+  whether the socket is really stale and if so, the socket file gets
+  removed and another bind is executed.
   
-  Reworked the two sections that discuss modifying the Visual Studio pre-
-  processor settings, and vc6libcurl.dsw/vc6libcurl.dsp, to remove the
-  project files references as they have been superseded by a more thorough
-  set of project files for VC6 through VC12, but to also give the correct
-  reference to this setting in later versions of Visual Studio.

-- configure: Fixed NTLM missing from features when CURL_DISABLE_HTTP defined
+- [Peter Wu brought this change]
 
-- build: Fixed no NTLM support for email when CURL_DISABLE_HTTP is defined
-  
-  USE_NTLM would only be defined if: HTTP support was enabled, NTLM and
-  cryptography weren't disabled, and either a supporting cryptography
-  library or Windows SSPI was being compiled against.
-  
-  This means it was not possible to build libcurl without HTTP support
-  and use NTLM for other protocols such as IMAP, POP3 and SMTP. Rather
-  than introduce a new SASL pre-processor definition, removed the HTTP
-  prerequisite just like USE_SPNEGO and USE_KRB5.
+  sws: add UNIX domain socket support
   
-  Note: Winbind support still needs to be dependent on CURL_DISABLE_HTTP
-  as it is only available to HTTP at present.
+  This extends sws with a --unix-socket option which causes the port to
+  be ignored (as the server now listens on the path specified by
+  --unix-socket). This feature will be available in the following patch
+  that enables checking for UNIX domain socket support.
   
-  This bug dates back to August 2011 when I started to add support for
-  NTLM to SMTP.

-- ntlm: Removed an unnecessary free of native Target Info
+  Proxy support (CONNECT) is not considered nor tested. It does not make

-  cmake: clean OtherTests, fixing -Werror
-  
-  There were several -Wunused warnings and one duplicate macro definition.
-  The EXTRA_DEFINES variable of the CurlCheckCSources macro was being
-  abused ("__unused1\n#undef inline\n#define __unused2", seriously?) to
-  insert extra C code. Avoid this broken abstraction and use cmake's
-  check_c_source_compiles directly (works fine with CMake 2.8, maybe
-  even cmake 2.6).
-  
-  After cleaning up all related variables (EXTRA_DEFINES,
-  HEADER_INCLUDES, auxiliary headers_hack), also remove a duplicate
-  add_headers_include macro and remove duplicate header additions before
-  the struct timeval check.
-  
-  Oh, and now the code is converted to use CheckCSourceRuns and
-  CheckCSourceCompiles, the two curl-specific helpers can be removed.
-  Unfortunately, the cmake output is now slightly more verbose. Before:
-  
-      Performing Test int send(int, const void *, size_t, int) (curl_cv_func_send_test)
-      Performing Test int send(int, const void *, size_t, int) (curl_cv_func_send_test) - Failed
-  
-  Since check_c_source_compiles prints the varname, now you see:
-  
-      Performing Test curl_cv_func_send_test
-      Performing Test curl_cv_func_send_test - Failed
-      Tested: int send(int, const void *, size_t, int)
-  
-  Compared cmake output with each other using vimdiff, no functional
-  differences were found. Tested with GCC 4.9.1 and Clang 3.5.0.

-  cmake: fix gethostby{addr,name}_r in CurlTests
-  
-  This patch cleans up the automatically-generated (?) code and fixes one
-  case that will always fail due to syntax error.
-  
-  HAVE_GETHOSTBYADDR_R_5_REENTRANT always failed because of a trailing
-  character ("int length;q"). Several parameter type and unused variable
-  warnings popped up. This causes a detection failure with -Werror.
-  
-  Observe that the REENTRANT cases are exactly the same as their
-  non-REENTRANT cases except for a `_REENTRANT` macro definition.
-  Merge all these pieces and build one big main function with different
-  cases, but reusing variables where logical.
+  runtests.pl: fix startup of IPv6 servers
   
-  For the cases where the parameters where NULL, I looked at
-  lib/hostip4.c to get an idea of the parameters types.
+  Commit curl-7_23_1-143-g8218064 changed the parameter of
+  responsive_http_server to accept types other than IPv6 (converting
+  from a boolean to a string), but only considered the lower-case "ipv6"
+  and not the "IPv6" variant. This caused all servers to start in IPv4
+  mode instead.
   
-  void-cast variables such as 'rc' to avoid -Wuninitialized errors.
+  This patch converts the remaining cases to "ipv6". While not strictly
+  necessary for the run*server variants, these got also converted for
+  consistency and to prevent future errors.

-  
-  A left over from the VC6 project files, so mainly cosmetic in Visual
-  Studio .NET as it can handle both comma and semi-colon characters for
-  separating multiple pre-processor definitions.
-  
-  However, the IDE uses semi-colons if the value is edited, and as such,

-  merging patches.
-  
-  Used the Visual Studio IDE to correct the separator character.
-

-  Prefer usage of Perl modules for sha1 calculation since there
-  might be systems where openssl is not installed or not in path.
-  If openssl is used for sha1 calculation then dont rely on cut
-  since it is usually not available on other systems than Linux.

+  forgotten to include the relevant pre-processor definitions.

-  cmake: generate pkg-config and curl-config
-  
-  Initial work to generate a pkg-config and curl-config script. Static
-  linking (`curl-config --static-libs` and `pkg-config --shared --libs
-  libcurl`) is broken and therefore disabled.
-  
-  CONFIGURE_OPTIONS does not make sense for CMake, use an empty string
-  for now.
-  
-  At least `curl-config --features` and `curl-config --protocols` work
-  which is needed by runtests.pl.
+  examples: Don't call select() to sleep on windows
   
-  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>

-
-  cmake: use LIBCURL_VERSION from curlver.h
+  Windows does not support using select() for sleeping without a dummy
+  socket. Instead use Windows' Sleep() and sleep for 100ms which is the
+  minimum suggested value in the curl_multi_fdset() doc.
   
-  This matches the behavior from autotools. The auxiliary major, minor
-  and patch components are not needed anymore and therefore removed.
+  Prior to this change the multi examples would exit prematurely since
+  select() would error instead of sleeping when called without an fd.

-  
-  For compatibility with autoconf, it will be used later for curl-config
-  and pkg-config. Not all features and or protocols can be enabled as
-  these are missing additional checks (see new TODOs).

+==============

  The largest amount of code and complexity is in the library part.

 Portability
 ===========
 
  We write curl and libcurl to compile with C89 compilers.  On 32bit and up
  machines. Most of libcurl assumes more or less POSIX compliance but that's
  not a requirement.
 
  We write libcurl to build and work with lots of third party tools, and we
  want it to remain functional and buildable with these and later versions
  (older versions may still work but is not what we work hard to maintain):

- GnuTLS       1.2
- zlib         1.1.4

  a suitable C compiler. On systems that don't run configure, we strive to keep
  curl running fine on:

  test case data files in the tests/FILEFORMAT file.
 
  The test suite automatically detects if curl was built with the memory
  debugging enabled, and if it was it will detect memory leaks, too.

+Asynchronous name resolves
+==========================
+
+ libcurl can be built to do name resolves asynchronously, using either the
+ normal resolver in a threaded manner or by using c-ares.
+
+<a name="cares"></a>
+[c-ares][3]
+------
+
+### Build libcurl to use a c-ares
+
+1. ./configure --enable-ares=/path/to/ares/install
+2. make
+
+### c-ares on win32
+
+ First I compiled c-ares. I changed the default C runtime library to be the
+ single-threaded rather than the multi-threaded (this seems to be required to
+ prevent linking errors later on). Then I simply build the areslib project
+ (the other projects adig/ahost seem to fail under MSVC).
+
+ Next was libcurl. I opened lib/config-win32.h and I added a:
+ `#define USE_ARES 1`
+
+ Next thing I did was I added the path for the ares includes to the include
+ path, and the libares.lib to the libraries.
+
+ Lastly, I also changed libcurl to be single-threaded rather than
+ multi-threaded, again this was to prevent some duplicate symbol errors. I'm
+ not sure why I needed to change everything to single-threaded, but when I
+ didn't I got redefinition errors for several CRT functions (malloc, stricmp,
+ etc.)
+
+<a name="curl_off_t"></a>
+`curl_off_t`
+==========
+
+ curl_off_t is a data type provided by the external libcurl include
+ headers. It is the type meant to be used for the [`curl_easy_setopt()`][1]
+ options that end with LARGE. The type is 64bit large on most modern
+ platforms.
+
+curlx
+=====
+
+ The libcurl source code offers a few functions by source only. They are not
+ part of the official libcurl API, but the source files might be useful for
+ others so apps can optionally compile/build with these sources to gain
+ additional functions.
+
+ We provide them through a single header file for easy access for apps:
+ "curlx.h"
+
+`curlx_strtoofft()`
+-------------------
+   A macro that converts a string containing a number to a curl_off_t number.
+   This might use the curlx_strtoll() function which is provided as source
+   code in strtoofft.c. Note that the function is only provided if no
+   strtoll() (or equivalent) function exist on your platform. If curl_off_t
+   is only a 32 bit number on your platform, this macro uses strtol().
+
+`curlx_tvnow()`
+---------------
+   returns a struct timeval for the current time.
+
+`curlx_tvdiff()`
+--------------
+   returns the difference between two timeval structs, in number of
+   milliseconds.
+
+`curlx_tvdiff_secs()`
+---------------------
+   returns the same as curlx_tvdiff but with full usec resolution (as a
+   double)
+
+Future
+------
+
+ Several functions will be removed from the public curl_ name space in a
+ future libcurl release. They will then only become available as curlx_
+ functions instead. To make the transition easier, we already today provide
+ these functions with the curlx_ prefix to allow sources to get built properly
+ with the new function names. The functions this concerns are:
+
+ - `curlx_getenv`
+ - `curlx_strequal`
+ - `curlx_strnequal`
+ - `curlx_mvsnprintf`
+ - `curlx_msnprintf`
+ - `curlx_maprintf`
+ - `curlx_mvaprintf`
+ - `curlx_msprintf`
+ - `curlx_mprintf`
+ - `curlx_mfprintf`
+ - `curlx_mvsprintf`
+ - `curlx_mvprintf`
+ - `curlx_mvfprintf`

+Content Encoding
+================
+
+## About content encodings
+
+ [HTTP/1.1][4] specifies that a client may request that a server encode its
+ response. This is usually used to compress a response using one of a set of
+ commonly available compression techniques. These schemes are 'deflate' (the
+ zlib algorithm), 'gzip' and 'compress'. A client requests that the sever
+ perform an encoding by including an Accept-Encoding header in the request
+ document. The value of the header should be one of the recognized tokens
+ 'deflate', ... (there's a way to register new schemes/tokens, see sec 3.5 of
+ the spec). A server MAY honor the client's encoding request. When a response
+ is encoded, the server includes a Content-Encoding header in the
+ response. The value of the Content-Encoding header indicates which scheme was
+ used to encode the data.
+
+ A client may tell a server that it can understand several different encoding
+ schemes. In this case the server may choose any one of those and use it to
+ encode the response (indicating which one using the Content-Encoding header).
+ It's also possible for a client to attach priorities to different schemes so
+ that the server knows which it prefers. See sec 14.3 of RFC 2616 for more
+ information on the Accept-Encoding header.
+
+## Supported content encodings
+
+ The 'deflate' and 'gzip' content encoding are supported by libcurl. Both
+ regular and chunked transfers work fine.  The zlib library is required for
+ this feature.
+
+## The libcurl interface
+
+ To cause libcurl to request a content encoding use:
+
+  [`curl_easy_setopt`][1](curl, [`CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING`][5], string)
+
+ where string is the intended value of the Accept-Encoding header.
+
+ Currently, libcurl only understands how to process responses that use the
+ "deflate" or "gzip" Content-Encoding, so the only values for
+ [`CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING`][5] that will work (besides "identity," which does
+ nothing) are "deflate" and "gzip" If a response is encoded using the
+ "compress" or methods, libcurl will return an error indicating that the
+ response could not be decoded.  If <string> is NULL no Accept-Encoding header
+ is generated.  If <string> is a zero-length string, then an Accept-Encoding
+ header containing all supported encodings will be generated.
+
+ The [`CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING`][5] must be set to any non-NULL value for
+ content to be automatically decoded.  If it is not set and the server still
+ sends encoded content (despite not having been asked), the data is returned
+ in its raw form and the Content-Encoding type is not checked.
+
+## The curl interface
+
+ Use the [--compressed][6] option with curl to cause it to ask servers to
+ compress responses using any format supported by curl.
+
+<a name="hostip"></a>
+hostip.c explained
+==================
+
+ The main compile-time defines to keep in mind when reading the host*.c source
+ file are these:
+
+## `CURLRES_IPV6`
+
+ this host has getaddrinfo() and family, and thus we use that. The host may
+ not be able to resolve IPv6, but we don't really have to take that into
+ account. Hosts that aren't IPv6-enabled have CURLRES_IPV4 defined.
+
+## `CURLRES_ARES`
+
+ is defined if libcurl is built to use c-ares for asynchronous name
+ resolves. This can be Windows or *nix.
+
+## `CURLRES_THREADED`
+
+ is defined if libcurl is built to use threading for asynchronous name
+ resolves. The name resolve will be done in a new thread, and the supported
+ asynch API will be the same as for ares-builds. This is the default under
+ (native) Windows.
+
+ If any of the two previous are defined, `CURLRES_ASYNCH` is defined too. If
+ libcurl is not built to use an asynchronous resolver, `CURLRES_SYNCH` is
+ defined.
+
+## host*.c sources
+
+ The host*.c sources files are split up like this:
+
+ - hostip.c      - method-independent resolver functions and utility functions
+ - hostasyn.c    - functions for asynchronous name resolves
+ - hostsyn.c     - functions for synchronous name resolves
+ - asyn-ares.c   - functions for asynchronous name resolves using c-ares
+ - asyn-thread.c - functions for asynchronous name resolves using threads
+ - hostip4.c     - IPv4 specific functions
+ - hostip6.c     - IPv6 specific functions
+
+ The hostip.h is the single united header file for all this. It defines the
+ `CURLRES_*` defines based on the config*.h and curl_setup.h defines.
+
+<a name="memoryleak"></a>
+Track Down Memory Leaks
+=======================
+
+## Single-threaded
+
+  Please note that this memory leak system is not adjusted to work in more
+  than one thread. If you want/need to use it in a multi-threaded app. Please
+  adjust accordingly.
+
+
+## Build
+
+  Rebuild libcurl with -DCURLDEBUG (usually, rerunning configure with
+  --enable-debug fixes this). 'make clean' first, then 'make' so that all
+  files actually are rebuilt properly. It will also make sense to build
+  libcurl with the debug option (usually -g to the compiler) so that debugging
+  it will be easier if you actually do find a leak in the library.
+
+  This will create a library that has memory debugging enabled.
+
+## Modify Your Application
+
+  Add a line in your application code:
+
+       `curl_memdebug("dump");`
+
+  This will make the malloc debug system output a full trace of all resource
+  using functions to the given file name. Make sure you rebuild your program
+  and that you link with the same libcurl you built for this purpose as
+  described above.
+
+## Run Your Application
+
+  Run your program as usual. Watch the specified memory trace file grow.
+
+  Make your program exit and use the proper libcurl cleanup functions etc. So
+  that all non-leaks are returned/freed properly.
+
+## Analyze the Flow
+
+  Use the tests/memanalyze.pl perl script to analyze the dump file:
+
+    tests/memanalyze.pl dump
+
+  This now outputs a report on what resources that were allocated but never
+  freed etc. This report is very fine for posting to the list!
+
+  If this doesn't produce any output, no leak was detected in libcurl. Then
+  the leak is mostly likely to be in your code.
+
+<a name="multi_socket"></a>
+`multi_socket`
+==============
+
+ Implementation of the `curl_multi_socket` API
+
+  The main ideas of this API are simply:
+
+   1 - The application can use whatever event system it likes as it gets info
+       from libcurl about what file descriptors libcurl waits for what action
+       on. (The previous API returns `fd_sets` which is very select()-centric).
+
+   2 - When the application discovers action on a single socket, it calls
+       libcurl and informs that there was action on this particular socket and
+       libcurl can then act on that socket/transfer only and not care about
+       any other transfers. (The previous API always had to scan through all
+       the existing transfers.)
+
+  The idea is that [`curl_multi_socket_action()`][7] calls a given callback
+  with information about what socket to wait for what action on, and the
+  callback only gets called if the status of that socket has changed.
+
+  We also added a timer callback that makes libcurl call the application when
+  the timeout value changes, and you set that with [`curl_multi_setopt()`][9]
+  and the [`CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION`][10] option. To get this to work,
+  Internally, there's an added a struct to each easy handle in which we store
+  an "expire time" (if any). The structs are then "splay sorted" so that we
+  can add and remove times from the linked list and yet somewhat swiftly
+  figure out both how long time there is until the next nearest timer expires
+  and which timer (handle) we should take care of now. Of course, the upside
+  of all this is that we get a [`curl_multi_timeout()`][8] that should also
+  work with old-style applications that use [`curl_multi_perform()`][11].
+
+  We created an internal "socket to easy handles" hash table that given
+  a socket (file descriptor) return the easy handle that waits for action on
+  that socket.  This hash is made using the already existing hash code
+  (previously only used for the DNS cache).
+
+  To make libcurl able to report plain sockets in the socket callback, we had
+  to re-organize the internals of the [`curl_multi_fdset()`][12] etc so that
+  the conversion from sockets to `fd_sets` for that function is only done in
+  the last step before the data is returned. I also had to extend c-ares to
+  get a function that can return plain sockets, as that library too returned
+  only `fd_sets` and that is no longer good enough. The changes done to c-ares
+  are available in c-ares 1.3.1 and later.
+
+<a name="structs"></a>
+Structs in libcurl
+==================
+
+This section should cover 7.32.0 pretty accurately, but will make sense even
+for older and later versions as things don't change drastically that often.
+
+## SessionHandle
+
+  The SessionHandle handle struct is the one returned to the outside in the
+  external API as a "CURL *". This is usually known as an easy handle in API
+  documentations and examples.
+
+  Information and state that is related to the actual connection is in the
+  'connectdata' struct. When a transfer is about to be made, libcurl will
+  either create a new connection or re-use an existing one. The particular
+  connectdata that is used by this handle is pointed out by
+  SessionHandle->easy_conn.
+
+  Data and information that regard this particular single transfer is put in
+  the SingleRequest sub-struct.
+
+  When the SessionHandle struct is added to a multi handle, as it must be in
+  order to do any transfer, the ->multi member will point to the `Curl_multi`
+  struct it belongs to. The ->prev and ->next members will then be used by the
+  multi code to keep a linked list of SessionHandle structs that are added to
+  that same multi handle. libcurl always uses multi so ->multi *will* point to
+  a `Curl_multi` when a transfer is in progress.
+
+  ->mstate is the multi state of this particular SessionHandle. When
+  `multi_runsingle()` is called, it will act on this handle according to which
+  state it is in. The mstate is also what tells which sockets to return for a
+  specific SessionHandle when [`curl_multi_fdset()`][12] is called etc.
+
+  The libcurl source code generally use the name 'data' for the variable that
+  points to the SessionHandle.
+
+  When doing multiplexed HTTP/2 transfers, each SessionHandle is associated
+  with an individual stream, sharing the same connectdata struct. Multiplexing
+  makes it even more important to keep things associated with the right thing!
+
+## connectdata
+
+  A general idea in libcurl is to keep connections around in a connection
+  "cache" after they have been used in case they will be used again and then
+  re-use an existing one instead of creating a new as it creates a significant
+  performance boost.
+
+  Each 'connectdata' identifies a single physical connection to a server. If
+  the connection can't be kept alive, the connection will be closed after use
+  and then this struct can be removed from the cache and freed.
+
+  Thus, the same SessionHandle can be used multiple times and each time select
+  another connectdata struct to use for the connection. Keep this in mind, as
+  it is then important to consider if options or choices are based on the
+  connection or the SessionHandle.
+
+  Functions in libcurl will assume that connectdata->data points to the
+  SessionHandle that uses this connection (for the moment).
+
+  As a special complexity, some protocols supported by libcurl require a
+  special disconnect procedure that is more than just shutting down the
+  socket. It can involve sending one or more commands to the server before
+  doing so. Since connections are kept in the connection cache after use, the
+  original SessionHandle may no longer be around when the time comes to shut
+  down a particular connection. For this purpose, libcurl holds a special
+  dummy `closure_handle` SessionHandle in the `Curl_multi` struct to use when
+  needed.
+
+  FTP uses two TCP connections for a typical transfer but it keeps both in
+  this single struct and thus can be considered a single connection for most
+  internal concerns.
+
+  The libcurl source code generally use the name 'conn' for the variable that
+  points to the connectdata.
+
+## Curl_multi
+
+  Internally, the easy interface is implemented as a wrapper around multi
+  interface functions. This makes everything multi interface.
+
+  `Curl_multi` is the multi handle struct exposed as "CURLM *" in external APIs.
+
+  This struct holds a list of SessionHandle structs that have been added to
+  this handle with [`curl_multi_add_handle()`][13]. The start of the list is
+  ->easyp and ->num_easy is a counter of added SessionHandles.
+
+  ->msglist is a linked list of messages to send back when
+  [`curl_multi_info_read()`][14] is called. Basically a node is added to that
+  list when an individual SessionHandle's transfer has completed.
+
+  ->hostcache points to the name cache. It is a hash table for looking up name
+  to IP. The nodes have a limited life time in there and this cache is meant
+  to reduce the time for when the same name is wanted within a short period of
+  time.
+
+  ->timetree points to a tree of SessionHandles, sorted by the remaining time
+  until it should be checked - normally some sort of timeout. Each
+  SessionHandle has one node in the tree.
+
+  ->sockhash is a hash table to allow fast lookups of socket descriptor to
+  which SessionHandle that uses that descriptor. This is necessary for the
+  `multi_socket` API.
+
+  ->conn_cache points to the connection cache. It keeps track of all
+  connections that are kept after use. The cache has a maximum size.
+
+  ->closure_handle is described in the 'connectdata' section.
+
+  The libcurl source code generally use the name 'multi' for the variable that
+  points to the Curl_multi struct.
+
+## Curl_handler
+
+  Each unique protocol that is supported by libcurl needs to provide at least
+  one `Curl_handler` struct. It defines what the protocol is called and what
+  functions the main code should call to deal with protocol specific issues.
+  In general, there's a source file named [protocol].c in which there's a
+  "struct `Curl_handler` `Curl_handler_[protocol]`" declared. In url.c there's
+  then the main array with all individual `Curl_handler` structs pointed to
+  from a single array which is scanned through when a URL is given to libcurl
+  to work with.
+
+  ->scheme is the URL scheme name, usually spelled out in uppercase. That's
+  "HTTP" or "FTP" etc. SSL versions of the protcol need its own `Curl_handler`
+  setup so HTTPS separate from HTTP.
+
+  ->setup_connection is called to allow the protocol code to allocate protocol
+  specific data that then gets associated with that SessionHandle for the rest
+  of this transfer. It gets freed again at the end of the transfer. It will be
+  called before the 'connectdata' for the transfer has been selected/created.
+  Most protocols will allocate its private 'struct [PROTOCOL]' here and assign
+  SessionHandle->req.protop to point to it.
+
+  ->connect_it allows a protocol to do some specific actions after the TCP
+  connect is done, that can still be considered part of the connection phase.
+
+  Some protocols will alter the connectdata->recv[] and connectdata->send[]
+  function pointers in this function.
+
+  ->connecting is similarly a function that keeps getting called as long as the
+  protocol considers itself still in the connecting phase.
+
+  ->do_it is the function called to issue the transfer request. What we call
+  the DO action internally. If the DO is not enough and things need to be kept
+  getting done for the entire DO sequence to complete, ->doing is then usually
+  also provided. Each protocol that needs to do multiple commands or similar
+  for do/doing need to implement their own state machines (see SCP, SFTP,
+  FTP). Some protocols (only FTP and only due to historical reasons) has a
+  separate piece of the DO state called `DO_MORE`.
+
+  ->doing keeps getting called while issuing the transfer request command(s)
+
+  ->done gets called when the transfer is complete and DONE. That's after the
+  main data has been transferred.
+
+  ->do_more gets called during the `DO_MORE` state. The FTP protocol uses this
+  state when setting up the second connection.
+
+  ->`proto_getsock`
+  ->`doing_getsock`
+  ->`domore_getsock`
+  ->`perform_getsock`
+  Functions that return socket information. Which socket(s) to wait for which
+  action(s) during the particular multi state.
+
+  ->disconnect is called immediately before the TCP connection is shutdown.
+
+  ->readwrite gets called during transfer to allow the protocol to do extra
+  reads/writes
+
+  ->defport is the default report TCP or UDP port this protocol uses
+
+  ->protocol is one or more bits in the `CURLPROTO_*` set. The SSL versions
+  have their "base" protocol set and then the SSL variation. Like
+  "HTTP|HTTPS".
+
+  ->flags is a bitmask with additional information about the protocol that will
+  make it get treated differently by the generic engine:
+
+  - `PROTOPT_SSL` - will make it connect and negotiate SSL
+
+  - `PROTOPT_DUAL` - this protocol uses two connections
+
+  - `PROTOPT_CLOSEACTION` - this protocol has actions to do before closing the
+    connection. This flag is no longer used by code, yet still set for a bunch
+    protocol handlers.
+  
+  - `PROTOPT_DIRLOCK` - "direction lock". The SSH protocols set this bit to
+    limit which "direction" of socket actions that the main engine will
+    concern itself about.
+
+  - `PROTOPT_NONETWORK` - a protocol that doesn't use network (read file:)
+
+  - `PROTOPT_NEEDSPWD` - this protocol needs a password and will use a default
+    one unless one is provided
+
+  - `PROTOPT_NOURLQUERY` - this protocol can't handle a query part on the URL
+    (?foo=bar)
+
+## conncache
+
+  Is a hash table with connections for later re-use. Each SessionHandle has
+  a pointer to its connection cache. Each multi handle sets up a connection
+  cache that all added SessionHandles share by default.
 
- There's no magic to this. When you consider everything stable enough to be
- released, do this:
+## Curl_share
+  
+  The libcurl share API allocates a `Curl_share` struct, exposed to the
+  external API as "CURLSH *".
 
-   1. Tag the source code accordingly.
+  The idea is that the struct can have a set of own versions of caches and
+  pools and then by providing this struct in the `CURLOPT_SHARE` option, those
+  specific SessionHandles will use the caches/pools that this share handle
+  holds.
 
-   2. run the 'maketgz' script (using 'make distcheck' will give you a pretty
-      good view on the status of the current sources). maketgz requires a
-      version number and creates the release archive. maketgz uses 'make dist'
-      for the actual archive building, why you need to fill in the Makefile.am
-      files properly for which files that should be included in the release
-      archives.
+  Then individual SessionHandle structs can be made to share specific things
+  that they otherwise wouldn't, such as cookies.
 
-   3. When that's complete, sign the output files.
+  The `Curl_share` struct can currently hold cookies, DNS cache and the SSL
+  session cache.
 
-   4. Upload
+## CookieInfo
 
-   5. Update web site and changelog on site
+  This is the main cookie struct. It holds all known cookies and related
+  information. Each SessionHandle has its own private CookieInfo even when
+  they are added to a multi handle. They can be made to share cookies by using
+  the share API.
 
-   6. Send announcement to the mailing lists
 
- NOTE: you must have curl checked out from git to be able to do a proper
- release build. The release tarballs do not have everything setup in order to
- do releases properly.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
-This function converts the given input \fBstring\fP to an URL encoded string
+This function converts the given input \fIstring\fP to a URL encoded string
 and returns that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not
 a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '-', '.', '_' or '~' are converted to their "URL escaped"
 version (%NN where NN is a two-digit hexadecimal number).
 
-If the \fBlength\fP argument is set to 0 (zero), \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP
-uses strlen() on the input \fBurl\fP to find out the size.
+If \fIlength\fP is set to 0 (zero), \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP uses strlen() on
+the input \fIstring\fP to find out the size.
 
 You must \fIcurl_free(3)\fP the returned string when you're done with it.
 .SH AVAILABILITY
 Added in 7.15.4 and replaces the old \fIcurl_escape(3)\fP function.
 .SH RETURN VALUE
 A pointer to a zero terminated string or NULL if it failed.

When the events on a socket are known, they can be passed as an events bitmask <span Class="bold">ev_bitmask</span> by first setting <span Class="bold">ev_bitmask</span> to 0, and then adding using bitwise OR (|) any combination of events to be chosen from CURL_CSELECT_IN, CURL_CSELECT_OUT or CURL_CSELECT_ERR.

 <p class="level0">We get many questions regarding how to issue HTTP POSTs with libcurl the proper way. This chapter will thus include examples using both different versions of HTTP POST that libcurl supports. 
 <p class="level0">The first version is the simple POST, the most common version, that most HTML pages using the &lt;form&gt; tag uses. We provide a pointer to the data and tell libcurl to post it all to the remote site:

 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">Simple enough, huh? Since you set the POST options with the <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)</span>, this automatically switches the handle to use POST in the upcoming request. 
 <p class="level0">Ok, so what if you want to post binary data that also requires you to set the Content-Type: header of the post? Well, binary posts prevent libcurl from being able to do strlen() on the data to figure out the size, so therefore we must tell libcurl the size of the post data. Setting headers in libcurl requests are done in a generic way, by building a list of our own headers and then passing that list to libcurl.

 <p class="level0">While the simple examples above cover the majority of all cases where HTTP POST operations are required, they don't do multi-part formposts.

They're called multi-part because they're built by a chain of parts, each part being a single unit of data. Each part has its own name and contents. You can in fact create and post a multi-part formpost with the regular libcurl POST support described above, but that would require that you build a formpost yourself and provide to libcurl. To make that easier, libcurl provides <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_formadd.html">curl_formadd</a>. Using this function, you add parts to the form. When you're done adding parts, you post the whole form.

 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS, long max);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a long to indicate \fBmax\fP. The set number will be used as the maximum
-amount of simultaneously open connections to a single host. For each new
-session to a host, libcurl will open a new connection up to the limit set by
+amount of simultaneously open connections to a single host (a host being the
+same as a host name + port number pair). For each new session to a host,
+libcurl will open a new connection up to the limit set by
 \fICURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP. When the limit is reached, the
 sessions will be pending until a connection becomes available. If
 \fICURLMOPT_PIPELINING(3)\fP is enabled, libcurl will try to pipeline if the
 host is capable of it.
 
 The default \fBmax\fP value is 0, unlimited.  However, for backwards
 compatibility, setting it to 0 when \fICURLMOPT_PIPELINING(3)\fP is 1 will not
 be treated as unlimited. Instead it will open only 1 connection and try to
 pipeline on it.
+
+This set limit is also used for proxy connections, and then the proxy is
+considered to be the host for which this limit counts.

 CURLMOPT_PIPELINING \- enable/disable HTTP pipelining

-CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING, bool onoff);
+CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING, long bits);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-Set the \fBonoff\fP parameter to 1 to make libcurl use HTTP pipelining for
-HTTP transfers done using this multi handle, as far as possible. This means
-that if you add a second request that can use an already existing connection,
-the second request will be \&"piped" on the same connection rather than being
-executed in parallel.
+Set the \fBbits\fP parameter to 1 to make libcurl use HTTP pipelining for
+HTTP/1.1 transfers done using this multi handle, as far as possible. This
+means that if you add a second request that can use an already existing
+connection, the second request will be \&"piped" on the same connection rather
+than being executed in parallel.
 
 When using pipelining, there are also several other related options that are
 interesting to tweak and adjust to alter how libcurl spreads out requests on
 different connections or not etc.
+
+Starting in 7.43.0, the \fBbits\fP parameter's bit 1 also has a meaning and
+libcurl is now offering symbol names for the bits:
+.IP CURLPIPE_NOTHING (0)
+Default, which means doing no attempts at pipelining or multiplexing.
+.IP CURLPIPE_HTTP1 (1)
+If this bit is set, libcurl will try to pipeline HTTP/1.1 requests on
+connections that are already established and in use to hosts.
+.IP CURLPIPE_MULTIPLEX (2)
+If this bit is set, libcurl will try to multiplex the new transfer over an
+existing connection if possible. This requires HTTP/2.

 Pass a char * to a \fIcookie\fP string.
 
 Such a cookie can be either a single line in Netscape / Mozilla format or just
 regular HTTP-style header (Set-Cookie: ...) format. This will also enable the
 cookie engine. This adds that single cookie to the internal cookie store.
 
+If you use the Set-Cookie format and don't specify a domain then the cookie
+is sent for any domain and will not be modified. If a server sets a cookie of
+the same name (or maybe you've imported one) then both will be sent on a future
+transfer to that server, likely not what you intended. Either set a domain in
+Set-Cookie (doing that will include sub domains) or use the Netscape format as
+shown in EXAMPLE.

 <p class="level0">This callback function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received interleaved RTP data. This function gets called for each $ block and therefore contains exactly one upper-layer protocol unit (e.g.  one RTP packet). Curl writes the interleaved header as well as the included data for each call. The first byte is always an ASCII dollar sign. The dollar sign is followed by a one byte channel identifier and then a 2 byte integer length in network byte order. See <span Class="emphasis"><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2326.txt">RFC 2326</a> Section 10.12</span> for more information on how RTP interleaving behaves.

 This POST is a normal application/x-www-form-urlencoded kind (and libcurl will
 set that Content-Type by default when this option is used), which is commonly
 used by HTML forms. Change Content-Type with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP.

+You can use \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP to url-encode your data, if necessary. It
+returns a pointer to an encoded string that can be passed as \fIpostdata\fP.

 If you want to do a zero-byte POST, you need to set
 \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE(3)\fP explicitly to zero, as simply setting
 \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP to NULL or "" just effectively disables the
 sending of the specified string. libcurl will instead assume that you'll send
 the POST data using the read callback!

 <p class="level0">Pass a bitmask to control how libcurl acts on redirects after POSTs that get a 301, 302 or 303 response back.  A parameter with bit 0 set (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_301</span>) tells the library to respect <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. Setting bit 1 (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_302</span>) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a 302 redirect whilst setting bit 2 (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_303</span>) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a 303 redirect. The value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_ALL</span> is a convenience define that sets all three bits. 
 <p class="level0">The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers, so the library does the conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a POST after such a redirection.

This may happen when doing a HTTP PUT or POST with a multi-pass authentication method, or when an existing HTTP connection is reused too late and the server closes the connection. The function shall work like fseek(3) or lseek(3) and it gets SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END as argument for <span Class="emphasis">origin</span>, although libcurl currently only passes SEEK_SET. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">userp</span> is the pointer you set with <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_SEEKDATA.html">CURLOPT_SEEKDATA</a>.

 Version Numbers and Releases
+============================
 
  Curl is not only curl. Curl is also libcurl. They're actually individually
  versioned, but they mostly follow each other rather closely.
 
  The version numbering is always built up using the same system:
 
-        X.Y[.Z]
+        X.Y.Z
+
+  - X is main version number
+  - Y is release number
+  - Z is patch number
 
- Where
-   X is main version number
-   Y is release number
-   Z is patch number
+## Bumping numbers
 
  One of these numbers will get bumped in each new release. The numbers to the
  right of a bumped number will be reset to zero. If Z is zero, it may not be
  included in the version number.
 
  The main version number will get bumped when *really* big, world colliding

  This 6-digit hexadecimal number is always a greater number in a more recent
  release. It makes comparisons with greater than and less than work.
 
  This number is also available as three separate defines:
- LIBCURL_VERSION_MAJOR, LIBCURL_VERSION_MINOR and LIBCURL_VERSION_PATCH.
+ `LIBCURL_VERSION_MAJOR`, `LIBCURL_VERSION_MINOR` and `LIBCURL_VERSION_PATCH`.

+Static linking of Microsoft's C RunTime (CRT):
+==============================================
+If you are using mode=static nmake will create and link to the static build of
+libcurl but *not* the static CRT. If you must you can force nmake to link in
+the static CRT by passing RTLIBCFG=static. Typically you shouldn't use that
+option, and nmake will default to the DLL CRT. RTLIBCFG is rarely used and
+therefore rarely tested. When passing RTLIBCFG for a configuration that was
+already built but not with that option, or if the option was specified
+differently, you must destroy the build directory containing the configuration
+so that nmake can build it from scratch.
