+Daniel Stenberg (15 Dec 2010)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with a865bd9fbaaa43e5c
+
+- IsPipeliningPossible: only for HTTP
+  
+  The function that checks if pipelining is possible now requires the HTTP
+  bit to be set so that it doesn't mistakenly tries to do it for other
+  protocols.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-12/0152.html
+  Reported by: Dmitri Shubin
+
+- multi_runsingle: don't timeout completed handles
+  
+  The generic timeout code must not check easy handles that are already
+  completed. Going to completed (again) within there risked decreasing the
+  number of alive handles again and thus it could go negative.
+  
+  This regression bug was added in 7.21.2 in commit ca10e28f06f1
+
+- symbols-in-versions: CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD fixed
+  
+  It was added in 7.17.0 and is not deprecated
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with c28443c551825
+
+Dan Fandrich (8 Dec 2010)
+- Mention that using other libraries can affect app licensing
+
+Yang Tse (7 Dec 2010)
+- easy: fix compiler warning: end-of-loop code not reached
+
+Daniel Stenberg (6 Dec 2010)
+- disconnect: pass on the dead_connection argument
+  
+  Cleanup fix after Kamil's commit 5c7c9a768d0093
+
+Yang Tse (6 Dec 2010)
+- sws: fix compier warning: external definition with no prior declaration
+
+Daniel Stenberg (6 Dec 2010)
+- [Heinrich Ko brought this change]
+
+  ossl_connect_common: detect connection re-use
+  
+  ossl_connect_common() now checks whether or not 'struct
+  connectdata->state' is equal 'ssl_connection_complete' and if so, will
+  return CURLE_OK with 'done' set to 'TRUE'. This check prevents
+  ossl_connect_common() from creating a new ssl connection on an existing
+  ssl session which causes openssl to fail when it tries to parse an
+  encrypted TLS packet since the cipher data was effectively thrown away
+  when the new ssl connection was created.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-11/0169.html
+
+Kamil Dudka (6 Dec 2010)
+- url: provide dead_connection flag in Curl_handler::disconnect
+  
+  It helps to prevent a hangup with some FTP servers in case idle session
+  timeout has exceeded.  But it may be useful also for other protocols
+  that send any quit message on disconnect.  Currently used by FTP, POP3,
+  IMAP and SMTP.
+
+Yang Tse (6 Dec 2010)
+- ssh: fix a download resume point calculation
+
+Daniel Stenberg (5 Dec 2010)
+- Curl_wait_for_resolv: correct timeout
+  
+  When looping in this function and checking for the timeout being
+  expired, it was not updating the reference time when calculating the
+  timediff since previous round which made it think each subsequent loop
+  to have taken longer than it actually did.
+  
+  I also modified the function to use the generic Curl_timeleft() function
+  instead of the custom logic.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3112579
+
+- Curl_send/recv_plain: return errno on failure
+  
+  When send() and recv() fail, we now store the errno value to allow the
+  app to access it.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3128121
+  Reported by: Yuri
+
+Guenter Knauf (5 Dec 2010)
+- Updated OpenSSL version.

+- fix compiler warning: conversion may lose significant bits
+
+- fix compiler warning: assignment within conditional expression
+
+- fix getinfo CURLINFO_LOCAL* for reused connections (take 2) follow-up
+  
+  - Show address string from proper buffer in case of connection failure.

+  
+  and the traditional source header

+  by Curl_getaddrinfo_ex() into the library.
+  
+  Also ensure that the ai_addrlen member of Curl_getaddrinfo_ex()'s output linked
+  list of Curl_addrinfo structures has appropriate family-specific address size.
+
+Kamil Dudka (22 Nov 2010)
+- openldap: use remote port in URL passed to ldap_init_fd()
+  
+  ... not the proxy port.  It makes no difference unless a proxy is used.
+
+Yang Tse (20 Nov 2010)
+- gtls: define and use gtls_EAGAIN, gtls_EINTR and gtls_EIO.
+  
+  Winsock builds clobber some errno.h defines in setup_once.
+
+Dan Fandrich (19 Nov 2010)
+- Added a couple examples that were missing from the tar ball
+
+- Check for errors while preprocessing curl.h in test 1119
+  
+  This showed a problem when running the test out-of-tree, so
+  an include path is now being added to pick up the generated
+  curlbuild.h file.
+
+- Use the 3-argument open for compatibility with older perls
+
+- [Matthias Bolte brought this change]
+
+  Detect socket errors in GnuTLS on Windows
+  
+  On Windows, translate WSAGetLastError() to errno values as GNU
+  TLS does it internally, too. This is necessary because send() and
+  recv() on Windows don't set errno when they fail but GNU TLS
+  expects a proper errno value.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3110991
+
+Yang Tse (19 Nov 2010)
+- test servers: fix strict aliasing compiler warnings
+

+  
+  Temporarily, When cross-compiling with gcc 3.0 or later, enable strict aliasing
+  rules and warnings. Given that cross-compiled targets autobuilds do not run the
+
+Julien Chaffraix (17 Nov 2010)
+- configure: Prevent link errors with --librtmp.
+  
+  If --librtmp was specified but pkg-config could not find the librtmp
+  file, we would have undefined symbols when linking curl.
+  
+  We prevent this error by disabling this case as suggested on the mailing
+  list.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (15 Nov 2010)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with cbf4961bf3e4
+
+- gnutls->handshake: improved timeout handling
+  
+  When no timeout is set, we call the socket_ready function with a timeout
+  value of 0 during handshake, which makes it loop too much/fast in this
+  function. It also made this function return CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT
+  wrongly on a slow handshake.
+  
+  However, the particular bug report that highlighted this problem is not
+  solved by this fix, as this fix only makes the more proper error get
+  reported instead.
+  
+  Bug: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=594150
+  Reported by: Johannes Ernst
+
+Julien Chaffraix (13 Nov 2010)
+- urldata: Capitalize enum protect_level values.
+  
+  This makes it easier to spot the enum values from the variables.
+  Removed some unneeded DEBUGASSERT added in the previous commit.
+
+- security: tighten enum protection_level usage.
+  
+  While changing Curl_sec_read_msg to accept an enum protection_level
+  instead of an int, I went ahead and fixed the usage of the associated
+  fields.
+  
+  Some code was assuming that prot_clear == 0. Fixed those to use the
+  proper value. Added assertions prior to any code that would set the
+  protection level.
+
+Yang Tse (13 Nov 2010)
+- configure: fix autoconf 2.68 warning: no AC_LANG_SOURCE call detected in body
+
+Daniel Stenberg (12 Nov 2010)
+- curl.1: "a file", not an
+
+- version-check.pl: display version number for symbols
+  
+  This script is the start of a helper tool that scans a source code and
+  outputs the most recent libcurl version it finds symbols for. Meaning
+  that if there's no conditions in the code, that's the earliest libcurl
+  version the scanned code requires.
+  
+  It is not added to the Makefile.am yet as it is still a bit crude, but
+  I'm committing it to keep it and allow us to work on it.
+
+- [Adam Light brought this change]
+
+  Makefile.vc6: fixed the xattr.c compile
+
+Julien Chaffraix (12 Nov 2010)
+- krb5: Use GSS_ERROR to check for error.
+  
+  This is the advised way of checking for errors in the GSS-API RFC.
+  Also added some '\n' to the error message so that they are not mixed
+  with other outputs.
+
+- security: Pass the right parameter to init.
+  
+  init is expecting app_data. Passing it the struct connecdata would make
+  us crash later.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Nov 2010)
+- HTTP Auth: Add CURLAUTH_ONLY
+  
+  This is a meta symbol. OR this value together with a single specific
+  auth value to force libcurl to probe for un-restricted auth and if not,
+  only that single auth algorithm is acceptable.
+  
+  For example you can use CURLAUTH_DIGEST|CURLAUTH_ONLY to make libcurl
+  first probe for what method to use, but yet only consider Digest to be
+  acceptable.
+  
+  Using _only_ CURLAUTH_DIGEST without the CURLAUTH_ONLY field, will make
+  libcurl explicitly use Digest right away and not do any probing.
+
+- ip_version: moved to connection struct
+  
+  The IP version choice was previously only in the UserDefined struct
+  within the SessionHandle, but since we sometimes alter that option
+  during a request we need to have it on a per-connection basis.
+  
+  I also moved more "init conn" code into the allocate_conn() function
+  which is designed for that purpose more or less.
+
+Yang Tse (11 Nov 2010)
+- buildconf: MAC OS X requires libtool version 1.5.26 or newer
+  
+  MAC OS X requires libtool version 1.5.26 or newer, otherwise
+  configure will mishandle *.dSYM directories when it runs.
+
+- configure: remove temporary autobuilds exercising of xattr function tests
+
+- configure: use autobuilds to temporarily exercise xattr function tests
+
+- xattr: portability fix
+
+- curl-functions: provide xattr function tests that also check number of arguments
+
+Daniel Stenberg (10 Nov 2010)
+- test1120: verify FTP response 421
+  
+  curl mustn't try to use the control connection after the 421 is received
+
+- ftpserver.pl: spellfix comment
+
+- [Rutger Hofman brought this change]
+
+  TFTP: resend the correct data
+  
+  I found a bug in tftp_tx() in tftp.c. If a data resend is done after
+  reception of an ACK/OACK, the call to sendto is wrong.
+
+- [Stefan Tomanek brought this change]
+
+  write extended attributes by using fsetxattr
+  
+  Instead of reopening the downloaded file, fsetxattr uses the (already
+  open) file descriptor to attach extended attributes. This makes the
+  procedure more robust against errors caused by moved or deleted files.
+
+Dan Fandrich (9 Nov 2010)
+- Check for getinfo errors before setting attributes
+
+Kamil Dudka (9 Nov 2010)

+  
+  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/650255
+  Reported by: Simon H.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Nov 2010)

+  
+  I also documented the filtering logic in the symbol-scan.pl function to
+  clarify why not all CURL_* symbols are included.
+
+Yang Tse (9 Nov 2010)
+- serial number bump
+
+Kamil Dudka (8 Nov 2010)
+- ftp: close connection as soon as ABOR has been sent
+  
+  ... and do not send ABOR unless really necessary.
+  
+  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/649347
+  Reported by: Simon H.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (8 Nov 2010)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with fc6c4c10f9faab08
+  
+  I also recounted and updated the command line and libcurl options.
+
+- help: indent the --xattr option like the others
+
+- curl.1: --resolve documented
+
+- CURLOPT_RESOLVE: documented
+
+- CURLOPT_USE_SSL: move from FTP options to connection options
+
+- xattr-check: correct the comment as well
+
+- xattr: use const char * for const strings
+
+- setxattr: fix the checks
+  
+  My copy and paste job was a little too much copy and I missed to adjust
+  it properly to sys/xattr.h all over and this is a fix to cure that.
+
+- CURLOPT_RESOLVE: added
+  
+  CURLOPT_RESOLVE is a new option that sends along a curl_slist with
+  name:port:address sets that will populate the DNS cache with entries so
+  that request can be "fooled" to use another host than what otherwise
+  would've been used. Previously we've encouraged the use of Host: for
+  that when dealing with HTTP, but this new feature has the added bonus
+  that it allows the name from the URL to be used for TLS SNI and server
+  certificate name checks as well.
+  
+  This is a first change. Surely more will follow to make it decent.
+
+Yang Tse (8 Nov 2010)
+- fix compiler warning
+
+Dan Fandrich (7 Nov 2010)
+- Added os-specific.c and xattr.c to the Symbian build files
+
+Yang Tse (7 Nov 2010)
+- xattr: fix VisualStudio builds
+
+- fix snapshot generation
+
+Daniel Stenberg (5 Nov 2010)
+- --libcurl: simplify output
+  
+  Removed the code that was needed for libcurl before 7.19.0 which now is
+  more than two years old.
+  
+  Simplified the top comment and corrected the URL.
+
+- [Alfred Gebert brought this change]
+
+  LDAP: detect non-binary attributes properly
+  
+  If the query result has a binary attribute, the binary attribute is
+  base64 encoded. But all following non binary attributes are also base64
+  encoded which is wrong.
+  
+  This is a test (LDAP server is public).
+  
+  curl
+  ldap://x500.bund.de:389/o=Bund,c=DE?userCertificate,certificateSerialNumber?sub
+  ?cn=*Woehleke*
+
+- xattr: add configure check and #ifdefs
+  
+  setxattr is a glibc call to set extended attributes, so configure now
+  checks for it and the code is adapted to only build when the
+  functionality is present.
+
+- [Stefan Tomanek brought this change]
+
+  save metadata to extended file attributes
+  
+  It is often convinient to track back the source of a once downloaded
+  file; this patch makes curl store the source URL and other metadata
+  alongside the retrieved file by using the extended attributes (if
+  supported by the file system and enabled by --xattr).
+
+- test: remove test 580
+  
+  Test 580 is removed again for two reasons:
+  
+  1) Some compilers aren't satisfied by just a data variable called 'test'
+  when first.o wants a function called 'test'. The Solaris compiler says
+  "ld: warning: symbol `test' has differing types:" while the AIX compiler
+  downright rejects it.
+  
+  2) Test case 1119 that was added after this test is way more complete
+  and cover everything test 580 does and more without introducing the same
+  problems.
+
+- Revert: use Host: name for SNI and cert name checks
+  
+  This reverts commit b0fd03f5b8d4520dd232a9d13567d16bd0ad8951,
+  4b2fbe1e97891f, afecd1aa13b4f, 68cde058f66b3
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: "TLS SNI use Host:" is done
+  
+  262 - Manual setting of TLS Server Name Indication - use Host:
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 7b823badbcab9d330
+
+- curl.1: added a few missing exit codes
+
+- certcheck: use the custom Host: name for checks
+  
+  If you use a custom Host: name in a request to a SSL server, libcurl
+  will now use that given name when it verifies the server certificate to
+  be correct rather than using the host name used in the actual URL.
+
+- SNI: simplify the custom host name use
+  
+  The redirect check is already done at the position where the customhost
+  field is assigned so there's no point in doing that a second time.
+
+- host: get the custom Host: name more genericly
+  
+  When given a custom host name in a Host: header, we can use it for
+  several different purposes other than just cookies, so we rename it and
+  use it for SSL SNI etc.
+
+- [Hongli Lai (Phusion) brought this change]
+
+  SNI: set name to custom Host header
+  
+  OpenSSL SNI host name should be set to the custom Host header, if the
+  user provided one.
+
+- fopen.c: re-indented, fixed previous mistake
+  
+  I've made the code intended using curl-style now to look more like other
+  examples.
+  
+  My previous "fix" was a bit too invasive but is now fixed again.
+
+- multi use: call multi_perform even on select() timeouts
+
+- example: add smtp-multi.c
+  
+  An example application source code sending SMTP mail with the multi
+  interface. It is based on the code Alona Rossen provided, which in turn
+  is based on existing example/test code, and I converted it even more
+  into a decent example with a fair multi API use, put the info required
+  to edit at the top and I added some comments.
+
+- CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL: add blurb about SIGPIPE
+
+Dan Fandrich (3 Nov 2010)
+- Allow building test 580 out of tree
+
+Daniel Stenberg (3 Nov 2010)
+- dist: add symbol-scan.pl to the tarball
+
+- test1119: verify symbols-in-versions
+
+- runtests: allow tests written as perl scripts
+  
+  If a command is set type="perl", it can now specify a perl program that will
+  be run instead of an ordinary curl or built tool.
+  
+  A perl test automatically disables memory and valgrind debugging.
+
+- symbol-scan: verifies symbols-in-versions
+  
+  This new script scans for all enums and #defines used by the curl/curl.h
+  and curl/multi.h headers. Then it reads all symbols mentioned in
+  symbols-in-vesions and make sure that there's no entries missing in
+  there. It then proceeds to verify that the entries that
+  symbols-in-vesions mentions but aren't found in the sources are truly
+  documented as removed.
+  
+  This script is used in the new test case 1119
+
+- symbols-in-versions: added 119 missing symbols
+  
+  I've developed a script I call symbol-scan.pl that scans the curl.h and
+  multi.h header files and compare the symbols it finds in there with the
+  symbols symbols-in-versions documents and outputs a report on the
+  differences.  Using this I've dug through the history to fill up
+  symbols-in-versions with all the symbols my script found mismatches for.
+  
+  I will commit symbol-scan.pl separatly and think of a way to put it to
+  use in the build/tests so that we from now on will get this in-sync
+  check automatically.
+
+Dan Fandrich (2 Nov 2010)
+- Added mk580.pl to the tar ball
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Nov 2010)
+- symbols-in-versions: added missing symbols
+
+- ignore: lib580.c is generated by mk580.pl
+
+- test: added test 580 - verifies symbols-in-versions
+  
+  The new perl script mk580.pl generates a C table in a fresh source file
+  named lib580.c and if that compiles fine we know that the file
+  docs/libcurl/symbols-in-versions at least doesn't include any symbols
+  that are misspelled.
+  
+  An additional feature would be to somehow scan curl/curl.h and compare
+  with symbols-in-versions to see if there are symbols missing.
+
+- spellfix: CURLOPT_TFTP_BLKSIZE it is
+
+Kamil Dudka (29 Oct 2010)
+- ftp: prevent server from hanging on closed data connection
+  
+  Some FTP servers (e.g. Pure-ftpd) end up hanging if we close the data
+  connection before transferring all the requested data.  If we send ABOR
+  in that case, it prevents the server from hanging.
+  
+  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/643656
+  Reported by: Pasi Karkkainen, Patrick Monnerat
+
+Dan Fandrich (28 Oct 2010)
+- Removed a leftover mention of FTP in an error message
+
+- Removed the native Makefile.riscos files
+  
+  These haven't worked in at least 8 years due to missing source
+  files, and most active RiscOS developers these days apparently
+  cross-compile anyway.
+  
+  Signed-off-by: James Bursa <james@zamez.org>
+
+- Lightened the stack in wc_statemach to permit deeper recursion
+  
+  Also, added a few hints to help compilers to perform tail call
+  recursion optimization.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Oct 2010)
+- SSH: use libssh2_session_handshake()
+  
+  In libssh2 1.2.8, libssh2_session_handshake() replaces
+  libssh2_session_startup() to fix the previous portability problem with
+  the socket type that was too small for win64 and thus easily could cause
+  crashes and more.
+
+- SSH: avoid using the libssh2_ prefix
+  
+  It is a bad idea to use the public prefix used by another library and
+  now we realize that libssh2 introduces a symbol in the upcoming version
+  1.2.8 that conflicts with our static function named libssh2_free.
+
+- formdata: provide error message
+  
+  When failing to build form post due to an error, the code now does a
+  proper failf(). Previously libcurl would report an error like "failed
+  creating formpost data" when a file wasn't possible to open which was
+  not easy for users to figure out.
+  
+  I also lower cased a function name to be named more curl-style and
+  removed some unnecessary code.
+
+- URL-parsing: consider ? a divider
+  
+  The URL parser got a little stricter as it now considers a ? to be a
+  host name divider so that the slightly sloppier URLs work too. The
+  problem that made me do this change was the reported problem with an URL
+  like: www.example.com?email=name@example.com This form of URL is not
+  really a legal URL (due to the missing slash after the host name) but is
+  widely accepted by all major browsers and libcurl also already accepted
+  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
+  
+  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the
+  ?  letter as part of user-name or password when given in the URL, which
+  it used to accept (and is tested in test 191). That letter is however
+  mentioned in RFC3986 to be required to be percent encoded since it is
+  used as a divider.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3090268
+
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: spellfix
+
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_USE_SSL is not just for FTP
+  
+  It is for FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP at least.
+
+- krb4.h: removed unused prototypes
+
+- krb4: make a few functions static
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: cleanup for 7.21.3 works
+  
+  "SFTP resume with 4GB file does not work" is now removed as I'm sure
+  this is really a libssh2 bug and not a libcurl bug.
+  
+  7.21.2 is released already
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: sync with 09a2d93a0f17ca
+
+- http_chunks: remove debug output
+  
+  Accidentally left in there during my previous debugging of this
+
+- Curl_setopt: disallow CURLOPT_USE_SSL without SSL support
+  
+  In order to avoid for example the pingpong protocols to issue STARTTLS
+  (or equivalent) even though there's no SSL support built-in.
+  
+  Reported by: Sune Ahlgren
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2010-10/0045.html
+
+- options: check for features for some options
+  
+  Some options, such as the automatic decompression and some SSL related
+  ones now will bail out if the underlying libcurl doesn't have support
+  for the particular feature needed.
+
+Dan Fandrich (14 Oct 2010)
+- Fixed the IPv6 host address in test1203
+  
+  Reported by: Christian Weisgerber
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3087479
+
+Daniel Stenberg (14 Oct 2010)
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify CURLOPT_CRLF
+  
+  The option takes a parameter that should be 1 or 0 to enable or disable
+  the feature.

 - RELEASE-NOTES: synced with ecd624b8e774a85

@@ -3983,500 +4708,6 @@
 - Make runtests.pl actually support any (valid) server specification
   for the <killserver> section of test harness definition files.
 
 - Fix tftp and sftp supported protocols in servername_str()
 
 - Make sockfilter kill messages look alike server ones
-
-- Adjust vor VPATH builds
-
-Daniel Stenberg (11 Jan 2010)
-- - Gil Weber reported a peculiar flaw with the multi interface when doing SFTP
-    transfers: curl_multi_fdset() would return -1 and not set and file
-    descriptors several times during a transfer of a single file. It turned out
-    to be due to two different flaws now fixed. Gil's excellent recipe helped me
-    nail this.
-
-- ssh_statemach_act() is now modified to loop over the switch() to perform as
-  much as possible in one go, as long as it doesn't block and hasn't reached the
-  end of the state machine.
-  This avoids spurious -1 returns from curl_multi_fdset() simply because
-  previously it would return from this function without anything in EWOUDLBLOCK
-  and thus basically it wasn't actually waiting for anything!!
-
-- After the TCP connect is confirmed in CURLM_STATE_WAITCONNECT and it changes
-  state, we return CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM unconditionally then so that we
-  can act faster like in the case the protocol-specific connect doesn't block
-  on anything and we can just persue on the next action immediately. It also
-  then avoids a case where curl_multi_fdset() would return -1.
-
-- progress callback called repeatedly during slow connects
-
-- - Made sure that the progress callback is repeatedly called at a regular
-    interval even during very slow connects.
-
-- - The tests/runtests.pl script now checks to see if the test case that runs is
-    present in the tests/data/Makefile.am and outputs a notice message on the
-    screen if not. Each test file has to be included in that Makefile.am to get
-    included in release archives and forgetting to add files there is a common
-    mistake. This is an attempt to make it harder to forget.

-- struct Curl_sh_entry's 'inuse' member was no longer used and is now removed
-
-- - Johan van Selst found and fixed a OpenSSL session ref count leak:
-  
-    ossl_connect_step3() increments an SSL session handle reference counter on
-    each call. When sessions are re-used this reference counter may be
-    incremented many times, but it will be decremented only once when done (by
-    Curl_ossl_session_free()); and the internal OpenSSL data will not be freed
-    if this reference count remains positive. When a session is re-used the
-    reference counter should be corrected by explicitly calling
-    SSL_SESSION_free() after each consecutive SSL_get1_session() to avoid
-    introducing a memory leak.

-- - Make curl support --ssl and --ssl-reqd instead of the previous FTP-specific
-    versions --ftp-ssl and --ftp-ssl-reqd as these options are now used to
-    control SSL/TLS for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP as well in addition to FTP. The old
-    option names are still working but the new ones are the prefered ones
-    (listed and documented).
-
-- stop at once if the EOB marker shows up, even if something else might get
-  sent afterwards
-
-- update copyright year since we are in 2010 now
-
-- added CURLOPT_FTP_USE_PRET
-
-- - Ingmar Runge enhanced libcurl's FTP engine to support the PRET command. This
-    command is a special "hack" used by the drftpd server, but even though it is
-    a custom extension I've deemed it fine to add to libcurl since this server
-    seems to survive and people keep using it and want libcurl to support
-    it. The new libcurl option is named CURLOPT_FTP_USE_PRET, and it is also
-    usable from the curl tool with --ftp-pret. Using this option on a server
-    that doesn't support this command will make libcurl fail.
-
-- added descriptions for CURLOPT_MAIL_FROM and CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT
-
-- --mail-rcpt and --mail-from are starting to settle and work like this...

-- turned CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT into a curl_slist list instead to support multiple

-
-- moved the SMTP payload escape function into Curl_smtp_escape_eob and put
-  it in smtp.c
-
-- (SMTP) support DATA better in the server and make sure to "escape" CRLF.CRLF

-- - Siegfried Gyuricsko found out that the curl manual said --retry would retry
-    on FTP errors in the transient 5xx range. Transient FTP errors are in the

-    Now the retry code retries on all FTP transfer failures that ended with a

-- argh, use the correct bug id

-- - Constantine Sapuntzakis figured out a case which would lead to libcurl

-- - Fixed curl erroneously reporting output stream write failures with disabled buffering

-- signal handling to cleanup on SIGINT and SIGTERM, followup
-
-Daniel Stenberg (7 Dec 2009)
-- - Martin Storsjo made libcurl use the Expect: 100-continue header for posts
-    with unknown size. Previously it was only used for posts with a known size
-    larger than 1024 bytes.
-
-- 74. The HTTP spec allows headers to be merged and become comma-separated
-    instead of being repeated several times. This also include Authenticate: and
-    Proxy-Authenticate: headers and while this hardly every happens in real life
-    it will confuse libcurl which does not properly support it for all headers -
-    like those Authenticate headers.

-
-Daniel Stenberg (1 Dec 2009)
-- - If the Expect: 100-continue header has been set by the application through
-    curl_easy_setopt with CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, the library should set
-    data->state.expect100header accordingly - the current code (in 7.19.7 at
-    least) doesn't handle this properly. Martin Storsjo provided the fix!
-
-- start working on 1.7.1
-
-Yang Tse (30 Nov 2009)
-- - In order to better reflect that the returned pid is extracted from the
-    given file, serverpid sub is renamed to pidfromfile. In addition it is
-    enhanced to make sure that it always returns zero unless a numerical
-    positive value is returned.
-  
-  - To better reflect that only process existance is actually checked,
-    checkserver sub is renamed to processexists. In addition it is enhanced
-    making it remove the given pid file when the extracted pid is no longer
-    alive.
