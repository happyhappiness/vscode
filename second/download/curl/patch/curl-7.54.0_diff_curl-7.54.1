-- nss: fix MinGW compiler warnings
-  
-  This fixes 3 warnings issued by MinGW:
-  1. PR_ImportTCPSocket actually has a paramter of type PROsfd instead of
-  PRInt32, which is 64 bits on Windows. Fixed this by including the
-  corresponding header file instead of redeclaring the function, which is
-  supported even though it is in the private include folder. [1]
-  2. In 64-bit mode, size_t is 64 bits while CK_ULONG is 32 bits, so an explicit
-  narrowing cast is needed.
-  3. Curl_timeleft returns time_t instead of long since commit
-  21aa32d30dbf319f2d336e0cb68d3a3235869fbb.

-  openssl: fix thread-safety bugs in error-handling
+Michael Kaufmann (11 Jun 2017)
+- FindWin32CACert: Use a temporary buffer on the stack
   
-  ERR_error_string with NULL parameter is not thread-safe. The library
-  writes the string into some static buffer. Two threads doing this at
-  once may clobber each other and run into problems. Switch to
-  ERR_error_string_n which avoids this problem and is explicitly
-  bounds-checked.
+  Don't malloc() the temporary buffer, and use the correct type:
+  SearchPath() works with TCHAR, but SearchPathA() works with char.
+  Set the buffer size to MAX_PATH, because the terminating null byte
+  is already included in MAX_PATH.
   
-  Also clean up some remnants of OpenSSL 0.9.5 around here. A number of
-  comments (fixed buffer size, explaining that ERR_error_string_n was
-  added in a particular version) date to when ossl_strerror tried to
-  support pre-ERR_error_string_n OpenSSLs.

-  Ignore everything after the version numbers in LIBCURL_VERSION and
-  LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM to ged rid of the extra CR character.
-  This makes tests 1022 and 1023 pass on Linux with a CRLF checkout.
+  With the introduction of expire IDs and the fact that existing timers
+  can be removed now and thus never expire, the concept with adding a
+  "latest" timer is not working anymore as it risks to not expire at all.

-
-- .gitattributes: force shell scripts to LF
+  So, to be certain the timers actually are in line and will expire, the
+  plain Curl_expire() needs to be used. The _latest() function was added
+  as a sort of shortcut in the past that's quite simply not necessary
+  anymore.

-  Issues and PRs with no activity for 180 days will get marked as stale,

+  cyassl/ssl.h needs the macros from cyassl/options.h, so define them
+  before including cyassl/ssl.h the first time, which happens in
+  urldata.h.
+  This broke the build on Ubuntu Xenial, which comes with WolfSSL 3.4.8
+  and therefore redefines the symbols from cyassl/options.h instead of
+  including the header.

-  multi: fix queueing of pending easy handles
+Michael Kaufmann (24 May 2017)
+- time: fix type conversions and compiler warnings
   
-  Multi handles repeatedly invert the queue of pending easy handles when
-  used with CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS. This is caused by a multistep
-  process involving Curl_splaygetbest and violates the FIFO property of
-  the multi handle.
-  This patch fixes this issue by redefining the "best" node in the
-  context of timeouts as the "smallest not larger than now", and
-  implementing the necessary data structure modifications to do this
-  effectively, namely:
-   - splay nodes with the same key are now stored in a doubly-linked
-     circular list instead of a non-circular one to enable O(1)
-     insertion to the tail of the list
-   - Curl_splayinsert inserts nodes with the same key to the tail of
-     the same list
-   - in case of multiple nodes with the same key, the one on the head of
-     the list gets selected

-- http: do not treat FTPS over CONNECT as HTTPS
+Dan Fandrich (9 May 2017)
+- tests: make test file names more unique
   
-  If we use FTPS over CONNECT, the TLS handshake for the FTPS control
-  connection needs to be initiated in the SENDPROTOCONNECT state, not
-  the WAITPROXYCONNECT state.  Otherwise, if the TLS handshake completed
-  without blocking, the information about the completed TLS handshake
-  would be saved to a wrong flag.  Consequently, the TLS handshake would
-  be initiated in the SENDPROTOCONNECT state once again on the same
-  connection, resulting in a failure of the TLS handshake.  I was able to
-  observe the failure with the NSS backend if curl ran through valgrind.
+  Include the test number in the names of files written out by tests to
+  reduce the chance of accidental duplication and to make it more clear
+  which test is associated with which file.
+
+- tests: removed redundant --trace-ascii arguments
   
-  Note that this commit partially reverts curl-7_21_6-52-ge34131d.
+  This is already added by the test suite; it's not clear why all these
+  tests had it, unless it's cargo-culting.

-  http: Fix proxy connection reuse with basic-auth
-  
-  When using basic-auth, connections and proxy connections
-  can be re-used with different Authorization headers since
-  it does not authenticate the connection (like NTLM does).
-  
-  For instance, the below command should re-use the proxy
-  connection, but it currently doesn't:
-  curl -v -U alice:a -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
-    --next -U bob:b -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/

+- curl: generate the --help output
   
-  This is a regression since refactoring of ConnectionExists()
-  as part of: cb4e2be7c6d42ca0780f8e0a747cecf9ba45f151
+  ... using the docs/cmdline-opts/gen.pl script, so that we get all the
+  command line option documentation from the same source.
   
-  Fix the above by removing the username and password compare
-  when re-using proxy connection at proxy_info_matches().
+  The generation of the list has to be done manually and pasted into the
+  source code.
   
-  However, this fix brings back another bug would make curl
-  to re-print the old proxy-authorization header of previous
-  proxy basic-auth connection because it wasn't cleared.
+  Closes #1465
+
+- tests: updated for modified fake random
+
+- [Jay Satiro brought this change]
+
+  rand: treat fake entropy the same regardless of endianness
   
-  For instance, in the below command the second request should
-  fail if the proxy requires authentication, but would succeed
-  after the above fix (and before aforementioned commit):
-  curl -v -U alice:a -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
-    --next -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
+  When the random seed is purposely made predictable for testing purposes
+  by using the CURL_ENTROPY environment variable, process that data in an
+  endian agnostic way so the the initial random seed is the same
+  regardless of endianness.
   
-  Fix this by clearing conn->allocptr.proxyuserpwd after use
-  unconditionally, same as we do for conn->allocptr.userpwd.
+  - Change Curl_rand to write to a char array instead of int array.
   
-  Also fix test 540 to not expect digest auth header to be
-  resent when connection is reused.
+  - Add Curl_rand_hex to write random hex characters to a buffer.

-  updatemanpages.pl: Update man pages to use current date and versions
+Jay Satiro (22 Apr 2017)
+- schannel: Don't treat encrypted partial record as pending data
   
-  Added script to update man pages to use the current date and
-  curl/libcurl versions.
+  - Track when the cached encrypted data contains only a partial record
+    that can't be decrypted without more data (SEC_E_INCOMPLETE_MESSAGE).
   
-  updatemanpages.pl has three arrays: list of directories to look in,
-  list of extensions to process, list of files to exclude from
-  processing.
+  - Change Curl_schannel_data_pending to return false in such a case.
   
-  Check man page in git repoistory using the date from the existing man
-  page before updating to avoid updating the man page if no change is
-  made.
+  Other SSL libraries have pending data functions that behave similarly.
   
-  If data is received from the git command then update the man page with
-  the current date and version otherwise leave alone.
+  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1387
   
-  Applied patch from badger to make the date argument optional, change the

-  Added code to process the changed man page into a new man page with
-  .dist added to the filename to keep the original source files unchanged.
-  Updated POD documentation to reflect that the date argument optional.
+  `if(nfds || extra_nfds) {` is followed by `malloc(nfds * ...)`.
   
-  Code style is in line with CODE_STYLE.md.
+  If `extra_fs` could be non-zero when `nfds` was zero, then we have
+  `malloc(0)` which is allowed to return `NULL`. But, malloc returning
+  NULL can be confusing. In this code, the next line would treat the NULL
+  as an allocation failure.
   
-  Directories: docs/ docs/libcurl/ docs/libcurl/opts/ tests/
-  Extensions: .1 .3
-  Excluded files: mk-ca-bundle.1 template.3
+  It turns out, if `nfds` is zero then `extra_nfds` must also be zero.
+  The final value of `nfds` includes `extra_nfds`.  So the test for
+  `extra_nfds` is redundant.  It can only confuse the reader.

+- typecheck-gcc: handle function pointers properly
   
-  "http://[127.0.0.1]:11211:80" which a lot of languages' URL parsers will
-  parse and claim uses port number 80, while libcurl would use port number
-  11211.
+  All the callbacks passed to curl_easy_setopt are defined as function
+  pointers. The possibility to pass both functions and function pointers
+  was handled for the callbacks that typecheck-gcc.h defined as
+  compatible, but not for the public callback types themselves.
   
-  "http://user@example.com:80@localhost" which by the WHATWG URL spec will
-  be treated to contain user name 'user@example.com' but according to
-  RFC3986 is user name 'user' for the host 'example.com' and then port 80
-  is followed by "@localhost"
+  This makes all compatible callback types defined in typecheck-gcc.h
+  function pointers too and checks all functions uniformly with
+  _curl_callback_compatible, which handles both functions and function
+  pointers.
   
-  Both these formats are now rejected, and verified so in test 1260.
+  A symptom of the problem was a warning in tool_operate.c with
+  --disable-libcurl-option and without --enable-debug as that file
+  passes the callback functions to curl_easy_setopt directly.

+- nss: fix MinGW compiler warnings
   
-  Assisted-by: Simon Warta <simon@kullo.net>
-  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1228
+  This fixes 3 warnings issued by MinGW:
+  1. PR_ImportTCPSocket actually has a paramter of type PROsfd instead of
+  PRInt32, which is 64 bits on Windows. Fixed this by including the
+  corresponding header file instead of redeclaring the function, which is
+  supported even though it is in the private include folder. [1]
+  2. In 64-bit mode, size_t is 64 bits while CK_ULONG is 32 bits, so an explicit
+  narrowing cast is needed.
+  3. Curl_timeleft returns time_t instead of long since commit
+  21aa32d30dbf319f2d336e0cb68d3a3235869fbb.

-  Move the proxy parse/init into helper create_conn_helper_init_proxy to
-  mitigate the chances some non-proxy code will be mistakenly added to it.
+  ERR_error_string with NULL parameter is not thread-safe. The library
+  writes the string into some static buffer. Two threads doing this at

-  This is likely to be the case when building from a tar ball release
-  package which includes a prebuilt man page. In that case, test the
-  packaged man page instead. This only makes a difference when building
-  out-of-tree (in-tree, the location in both cases is identical).
+  This adds -Werror-implicit-function-declaration for GCC 2.95+ so that

+  at link time.
+  Implicit function declarations are illegal in C99 and C++ anyway, and

-- tests: use consistent environment variables for setting charset
+Kamil Dudka (10 Apr 2017)
+- nss: load CA certificates even with --insecure
   
-  The character set in POSIX is set by the locale defined by (in
-  decreasing order of precedence) the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG
-  environment variables (CHARSET was used by libidn but not libidn2).
-  LC_ALL is cleared to ensure that LC_CTYPE takes effect, but LC_ALL is
-  not used to set the locale to ensure that other parts of the locale
-  aren't overridden.  Since there doesn't seem to be a cross-platform way
-  of specifying a UTF-8 locale, and not all systems may support UTF-8, a
-  <precheck> is used to skip the test if UTF-8 can't be verified to be
-  available.  Test 1035 was also converted to UTF-8 for consistency, as
-  the actual character set used there is irrelevant to the test.
+  ... because they may include an intermediate certificate for a client
+  certificate and the intermediate certificate needs to be presented to
+  the server, no matter if we verify the peer or not.
   
-  This patch uses a different UTF-8 locale than the last attempt, namely
-  en_US.UTF-8. This one has been verified on 7 different Linux and BSD
-  distributions and is more complete and usable than the locale UTF-8 (on
-  at least some systems).

-- speed caps: update the timeouts if the speed is too low/high
+  multi: fix queueing of pending easy handles
   
-  Follow-up to 4b86113
+  Multi handles repeatedly invert the queue of pending easy handles when
+  used with CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS. This is caused by a multistep
+  process involving Curl_splaygetbest and violates the FIFO property of
+  the multi handle.
+  This patch fixes this issue by redefining the "best" node in the
+  context of timeouts as the "smallest not larger than now", and
+  implementing the necessary data structure modifications to do this
+  effectively, namely:
+   - splay nodes with the same key are now stored in a doubly-linked
+     circular list instead of a non-circular one to enable O(1)
+     insertion to the tail of the list
+   - Curl_splayinsert inserts nodes with the same key to the tail of
+     the same list
+   - in case of multiple nodes with the same key, the one on the head of
+     the list gets selected

-- tool_operate: Show HTTPS-Proxy options on CURLE_SSL_CACERT
+Marcel Raad (3 Apr 2017)
+- tests/server/util: remove in6addr_any for recent MinGW
   
-  When CURLE_SSL_CACERT occurs the tool shows a lengthy error message to
-  the user explaining possible solutions such as --cacert and --insecure.
+  In ancient MinGW versions, in6addr_any was declared as extern, but not
+  defined. Because of that, 22a0c57746ae12506b1ba0f0fafffd26c1907d6a added
+  definitions for in6addr_any when compiling with MinGW. The bug was fixed in
+  w32api version 3.6 from 2006, so this workaround is not needed anymore for
+  recent versions.
   
-  This change appends to that message similar options --proxy-cacert and
-  --proxy-insecure when there's a specified HTTPS proxy.
+  This fixes the following MinGW-w64 warnings because the MinGW-w64 version of
+  IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT has the two additional braces inside the macro:
+  util.c:59:14: warning: braces around scalar initializer
+  util.c:59:40: warning: excess elements in scalar initializer

+- http: do not treat FTPS over CONNECT as HTTPS
+  
+  If we use FTPS over CONNECT, the TLS handshake for the FTPS control
+  connection needs to be initiated in the SENDPROTOCONNECT state, not
+  the WAITPROXYCONNECT state.  Otherwise, if the TLS handshake completed
+  without blocking, the information about the completed TLS handshake
+  would be saved to a wrong flag.  Consequently, the TLS handshake would
+  be initiated in the SENDPROTOCONNECT state once again on the same
+  connection, resulting in a failure of the TLS handshake.  I was able to
+  observe the failure with the NSS backend if curl ran through valgrind.

-  Ref: https://sourceforge.net/blog/introducing-https-for-project-websites/
-  Closes: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1247
-
-Jay Satiro (6 Feb 2017)
-- docs: Add more HTTPS proxy documentation
+  When using basic-auth, connections and proxy connections
+  can be re-used with different Authorization headers since
+  it does not authenticate the connection (like NTLM does).
   
-  - Document HTTPS proxy type.
+  For instance, the below command should re-use the proxy
+  connection, but it currently doesn't:
+  curl -v -U alice:a -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
+    --next -U bob:b -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
   
-  - Document --write-out %{proxy_ssl_verify_result}.
+  This is a regression since refactoring of ConnectionExists()
+  as part of: cb4e2be7c6d42ca0780f8e0a747cecf9ba45f151
   
-  - Document SOCKS proxy + HTTP/HTTPS proxy combination.
+  Fix the above by removing the username and password compare
+  when re-using proxy connection at proxy_info_matches().
   
-  HTTPS proxy support was added in 7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.
+  However, this fix brings back another bug would make curl
+  to re-print the old proxy-authorization header of previous
+  proxy basic-auth connection because it wasn't cleared.
   
-  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/cb4e2be
-
-- OS400: Fix symbols
+  For instance, in the below command the second request should
+  fail if the proxy requires authentication, but would succeed
+  after the above fix (and before aforementioned commit):
+  curl -v -U alice:a -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
+    --next -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/

-    Follow-up to 7907a2b and 845522c.

+  unconditionally, same as we do for conn->allocptr.userpwd.
   
-  - Fix incorrect id for CURLOPT_PROXY_PINNEDPUBLICKEY.
+  Also fix test 540 to not expect digest auth header to be
+  resent when connection is reused.

-  schannel: fix wildcard cert name validation on Win CE
+  rand: added missing #ifdef HAVE_FCNTL_H around fcntl.h header
   
-  Fixes a few issues in manual wildcard cert name validation in
-  schannel support code for Win32 CE:
-  - when comparing the wildcard name to the hostname, the wildcard
-    character was removed from the cert name and the hostname
-    was checked to see if it ended with the modified cert name.
-    This allowed cert names like *.com to match the connection
-    hostname. This violates recommendations from RFC 6125.
-  - when the wildcard name in the certificate is longer than the
-    connection hostname, a buffer overread of the connection

+- digest_sspi: Handle 'stale=TRUE' directive in HTTP digest
   
-  Added the corresponding --preroxy command line option. Sets a SOCKS
-  proxy to connect to _before_ connecting to a HTTP(S) proxy.
-
-- curl: normal socks proxies still use CURLOPT_PROXY
+  - If the server has provided another challenge use it as the replacement
+    input token if stale=TRUE. Otherwise previous credentials have failed
+    so return CURLE_LOGIN_DENIED.
   
-  ... the newly introduced CURLOPT_SOCKS_PROXY is special and should be
-  asked for specially. (Needs new code.)
+  Prior to this change the stale directive was ignored and if another
+  challenge was received it would cause error CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING.
   
-  Unified proxy type to a single variable in the config struct.
-
-- CURLOPT_SOCKS_PROXYTYPE: removed
+  Ref: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#page-10
   
-  This was added as part of the SOCKS+HTTPS proxy merge but there's no

-  openssl: don't use OpenSSL's ERR_PACK.
+  sftp: improved checks for create dir failures
   
-  ERR_PACK is an internal detail of OpenSSL. Also, when using it, a
-  function name must be specified which is overly specific: the test will
-  break whenever OpenSSL internally change things so that a different
-  function creates the error.
+  Since negative values are errors and not only -1. This makes SFTP upload

+- mbedtls: disable TLS session tickets
   
-  An HTTPS proxy receives all transactions over an SSL/TLS connection.
-  Once a secure connection with the proxy is established, the user agent
-  uses the proxy as usual, including sending CONNECT requests to instruct
-  the proxy to establish a [usually secure] TCP tunnel with an origin
-  server. HTTPS proxies protect nearly all aspects of user-proxy
-  communications as opposed to HTTP proxies that receive all requests
-  (including CONNECT requests) in vulnerable clear text.
+  SSL session reuse with TLS session tickets is not supported yet.
+  Use SSL session IDs instead.
   
-  With HTTPS proxies, it is possible to have two concurrent _nested_
-  SSL/TLS sessions: the "outer" one between the user agent and the proxy
-  and the "inner" one between the user agent and the origin server
-  (through the proxy). This change adds supports for such nested sessions
-  as well.
+  See https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/1109
+
+- gnutls: disable TLS session tickets
   
-  A secure connection with a proxy requires its own set of the usual SSL
-  options (their actual descriptions differ and need polishing, see TODO):
+  SSL session reuse with TLS session tickets is not supported yet.
+  Use SSL session IDs instead.

+  In addition to unix domain sockets, Linux also supports an

+  schannel: fix wildcard cert name validation on Win CE
   
-  words with underscore need to be within `these`
+  Fixes a few issues in manual wildcard cert name validation in
+  schannel support code for Win32 CE:
+  - when comparing the wildcard name to the hostname, the wildcard
+    character was removed from the cert name and the hostname
+    was checked to see if it ended with the modified cert name.
+    This allowed cert names like *.com to match the connection
+    hostname. This violates recommendations from RFC 6125.
+  - when the wildcard name in the certificate is longer than the
+    connection hostname, a buffer overread of the connection
+    hostname buffer would occur during the comparison of the
+    certificate name and the connection hostname.

+  It doesn't benefit us much as the connection could get closed at
+  any time, and also by checking we lose the ability to determine
+  if the socket was closed by reading zero bytes.
   
-  This is a follow-up to d2c6d15 which switched mk-ca-bundle.vbs output to
-  ANSI due to corrupt UTF-8 output, now fixed.
+  Reported-by: Michael Kaufmann
   
-  This change completes making the default certificate bundle output of
-  mk-ca-bundle.vbs as close as possible to that of mk-ca-bundle.pl, which
-  should make it easier to review any difference between their output.
+  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1134

+
+- http_proxy: simplify CONNECT response reading
   
-  - Comment out the options that disabled SSL cert checking by default.

+  and it is no longer limited to get the whole response within 16K, it is
+  now instead only limited to 16K maximum header line lengths.

+- CONNECT: read responses one byte at a time
   
-  - Fix cert issuer name output.
+  ... so that it doesn't read data that is actually coming from the
+  remote. 2xx responses have no body from the proxy, that data is from the
+  peer.
   
-  The cert issuer output is now ansi, converted from UTF-8. Prior to this
-  it was corrupt UTF-8. It turns out though we can work with UTF-8 the
-  FSO object that writes ca-bundle can't write UTF-8, so there will have
-  to be some alternative if UTF-8 is needed (like an ADODB.Stream).
+  Fixes #1132
+
+- CONNECT: reject TE or CL in 2xx responses
   
-  - Disable the certificate text info feature.
+  A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header
+  fields in a 2xx (Successful) response to CONNECT. (RFC 7231 section
+  4.3.6)
   
-  The certificate text info doesn't work properly with any recent OpenSSL.

-
-- test557: verify printf() with 128 and 129 arguments
-
-- mprintf: return error on too many arguments
+  An HTTPS proxy receives all transactions over an SSL/TLS connection.
+  Once a secure connection with the proxy is established, the user agent
+  uses the proxy as usual, including sending CONNECT requests to instruct
+  the proxy to establish a [usually secure] TCP tunnel with an origin
+  server. HTTPS proxies protect nearly all aspects of user-proxy
+  communications as opposed to HTTP proxies that receive all requests
+  (including CONNECT requests) in vulnerable clear text.
   
-  128 arguments should be enough for everyone
-
-- ftp: fix Curl_ftpsendf()
+  With HTTPS proxies, it is possible to have two concurrent _nested_
+  SSL/TLS sessions: the "outer" one between the user agent and the proxy
+  and the "inner" one between the user agent and the origin server
+  (through the proxy). This change adds supports for such nested sessions
+  as well.
   
-  ... it no longer takes printf() arguments since it was only really taken
-  advantage by one user and it was not written and used in a safe
-  way. Thus the 'f' is removed from the function name and the proto is
-  changed.
+  A secure connection with a proxy requires its own set of the usual SSL
+  options (their actual descriptions differ and need polishing, see TODO):
   
-  Although the current code wouldn't end up in badness, it was a risk that
-  future changes could end up springf()ing too large data or passing in a
-  format string inadvertently.

+- bump: start working on 7.51.1
 
-  speed caps: not based on average speeds anymore
-  
-  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
-  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
-  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
-  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
-  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
-  bursts" (as told in man page).
-  
-  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
-  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
-  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
-  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
-  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
-  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
+- winbuild: remove strcase.obj from curl build
   
-  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
-  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
-  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
-  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
-  case of sudden speed burst).

+- url: remove unconditional idn2.h include
   
-  When we're uploading using FTP and the server issues a tiny pause
-  between opening the connection to the client's secondary socket, the
-  client's initial poll() times out, which leads to second poll() which
-  does not wait for POLLIN on the secondary socket. So that poll() also
-  has to time out, creating a long (200ms) pause.
+  Mistake brought by 9c91ec778104a
+
+- curl_strequal: part of public API/ABI, needs to be kept
   
-  This patch adds the correct flag to the secondary socket, making the
-  second poll() correctly wait for the connection there too.
+  These two public functions have been mentioned as deprecated since a
+  very long time but since they are still part of the API and ABI we need
+  to keep them around.

+  CVE-2016-8621
   
-  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
-  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
-  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
-  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.

+
+- cookies: getlist() now holds deep copies of all cookies
   
-     curl -E 'pkcs11\:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  Previously it only held references to them, which was reckless as the
+  thread lock was released so the cookies could get modified by other
+  handles that share the same cookie jar over the share interface.
   
-  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
-  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
-  differences for different applications.
+  CVE-2016-8623
   
-  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
-  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
-  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
-  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
-  the URI itself.

-  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as

-  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
-  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
+  CVE-2016-8625
   
-  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
-  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
-  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
-  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

-  I discovered some people have been using "https://example.com" style

+  Since there is no progress meter it was somewhat unexpected that after

-  I think this misleads users into believing curl uses HTTPS to proxies

-
-- multi: make Curl_expire() work with 0 ms timeouts
+  - Change all predefined Mozilla URLs to HTTPS (Gregory Szorc).
   
-  Previously, passing a timeout of zero to Curl_expire() was a magic code
-  for clearing all timeouts for the handle. That is now instead made with
-  the new Curl_expire_clear() function and thus a 0 timeout is fine to set
-  and will trigger a timeout ASAP.
+  - New option -k to allow URLs other than HTTPS and enable HTTP fallback.
   
-  This will help removing short delays, in particular notable when doing
-  HTTP/2.
-
-- transfer: return without select when the read loop reached maxcount
+  Prior to this change the default URL retrieval mode was to fall back to
+  HTTP if HTTPS didn't work.
   
-  Regression added in 790d6de48515. The was then added to avoid one
-  particular transfer to starve out others. But when aborting due to
-  reading the maxcount, the connection must be marked to be read from
-  again without first doing a select as for some protocols (like SFTP/SCP)
-  the data may already have been read off the socket.

-  format MLSD from RFC 3659 and compare it to LIST.
+  No longer attempt to use "doomed" to-be-closed connections when
+  pipelining. Prior to this change connections marked for deletion (e.g.
+  timeout) would be erroneously used, resulting in sporadic crashes.

-- curl-compilers.m4: improve detection of GCC's -fvisibility= flag
-  
-  Some builds of GCC produce output on both stdout and stderr when --help
-  --verbose is used.  The 2>&1 redirection caused them to be arbitrarily
-  interleaved with each other because of stream buffering.  Consequently,
-  grep failed to match the fvisibility= string in the mixed output, even
-  though the string was present in GCC's standard output.

-  vtls: fix ssl session cache race condition
+- openssl: fix per-thread memory leak usiong 1.0.1 or 1.0.2
   
-  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
-  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
-  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
-  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
-  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
-  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
-  This commit:
-   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
-     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
-   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
-     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
-   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
-     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
-     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
-     this race.
+  OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 build an error queue that is stored per-thread
+  so we need to clean it when easy handles are freed, in case the thread
+  will be killed in which the easy handle was used. All OpenSSL code in
+  libcurl should extract the error in association with the error already
+  so clearing this queue here should be harmless at worst.

+  mbedtls: switch off NTLM in build if md4 isn't available
+  
+  NTLM support with mbedTLS was added in 497e7c9 but requires that mbedTLS
+  is built with the MD4 functions available, which it isn't in default
+  builds. This now adapts if the funtion isn't there and builds libcurl
+  without NTLM support if so.

+  Fixes #1004

 request](https://github.com/curl/curl/pulls) to the curl project to have
 changes merged.

-that is easy to merge and they are easy to track and not that easy to loose

+We strongly prefer pull requests to mailed patches, as it makes it a proper
+git commit that is easy to merge and they are easy to track and not that easy
+to loose in the flood of many emails, like they sometimes do on the mailing
+lists.
+
+Every pull request submitted will automatically be tested in several different
+ways. Every pull request is verfied that:
+
+ - ... the code still builds, warning-free, on Linux and macOS, with both
+   clang and gcc
+ - ... the code still builds fine on Windows with several MSVC versions
+ - ... the code still builds with cmake on Linux, with gcc and clang
+ - ... the code follows rudimentary code style rules
+ - ... the test suite still runs 100% fine
+ - ... the release tarball (the "dist") still works
+ - ... the code coverage doesn't shrink drastically
+
+If the pull-request fails one of these tests, it will show up as a red X and
+you are expected to fix the problem. If you don't understand whan the issue is
+or have other problems to fix the complaint, just ask and other project
+members will likely be able to help out.
 
 When you adjust your pull requests after review, consider squashing the
 commits so that we can review the full updated version more easily.

 .SH NAME
 curl_slist_append - add a string to an slist
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 .B #include <curl/curl.h>
 .sp
 .BI "struct curl_slist *curl_slist_append(struct curl_slist *" list,
 .BI "const char * "string ");"
 .ad
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-curl_slist_append() appends a specified string to a linked list of
-strings. The existing \fIlist\fP should be passed as the first argument while
-the new list is returned from this function. The specified \fIstring\fP has
-been appended when this function returns. curl_slist_append() copies the
-string.
+\fIcurl_slist_append(3)\fP appends a string to a linked list of strings. The
+existing \fBlist\fP should be passed as the first argument and the new list is
+returned from this function. Pass in NULL in the \fBlist\fP argument to create
+a new list. The specified \fBstring\fP has been appended when this function
+returns. \fIcurl_slist_append(3)\fP copies the string.
 
 The list should be freed again (after usage) with
 \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP.
 .SH RETURN VALUE
 A null pointer is returned if anything went wrong, otherwise the new list
 pointer is returned.

 This option is by default set to the system path where libcurl's cacert bundle
 is assumed to be stored, as established at build time.
 
 If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module

+Starting with curl-7.55.0, if both \fICURLOPT_CAINFO(3)\fP and
+\fICURLOPT_CAPATH(3)\fP are unset, NSS-linked libcurl tries to load
+libnssckbi.so, which contains a more comprehensive set of trust information
+than supported by nss-pem, because libnssckbi.so also includes information
+about distrusted certificates.
 
 (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then this
 option is supported for backward compatibility with other SSL engines, but it
 should not be set. If the option is not set, then curl will use the
 certificates in the system and user Keychain to verify the peer, which is the
 preferred method of verifying the peer's certificate chain.

 .SH NAME
 CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL \- tunnel through HTTP proxy
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL, long tunnel);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-Set the parameter to 1 to make libcurl tunnel all operations through the HTTP
-proxy. There is a big difference between using a proxy and to tunnel through
-it. If you don't know what this means, you probably don't want this tunneling
-option.
+Set the \fBtunnel\fP parameter to 1L to make libcurl tunnel all operations
+through the HTTP proxy (set with \fICURLOPT_PROXY(3)\fP). There is a big
+difference between using a proxy and to tunnel through it.
 
-Tunneling essentially means that a CONNECT is sent to the proxy, asking it to
-connect to a remote host on a specific port number and then the traffic is
-just passed through the proxy. Proxies tend to whitelist specific port numbers
+Tunneling means that a HTTP CONNECT request is sent to the proxy, asking it
+to connect to a remote host on a specific port number and then the traffic is
+just passed through the proxy. Proxies tend to white-list specific port numbers
 it allows CONNECT requests to and often only port 80 and 443 are allowed.
 
-When using this, it only makes sense to use \fICURLOPT_PROXYTYPE(3)\fP set to
-a HTTP proxy.
-
 To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers from user callbacks use
 \fICURLOPT_SUPPRESS_CONNECT_HEADERS(3)\fP.
+
+HTTP proxies can generally only speak HTTP (for obvious reasons), which makes
+libcurl convert non-HTTP requests to HTTP when using an HTTP proxy without
+this tunnel option set. For example, asking for an FTP URL and specifying an
+HTTP proxy will make libcurl send an FTP URL in a HTTP GET request to the
+proxy. By instead tunneling through the proxy, you avoid that conversion (that
+rarely works through the proxy anyway).

 an impact on what other features of the library you can use, such as
 \fICURLOPT_QUOTE(3)\fP and similar FTP specifics that don't work unless you
 tunnel through the HTTP proxy. Such tunneling is activated with
 \fICURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL(3)\fP.
 
-libcurl respects the environment variables \fBhttp_proxy\fP, \fBftp_proxy\fP,
-\fBall_proxy\fP etc, if any of those are set. The \fICURLOPT_PROXY(3)\fP
-option does however override any possibly set environment variables.

 Setting the proxy string to "" (an empty string) will explicitly disable the
 use of a proxy, even if there is an environment variable set for it.
 
 A proxy host string can also include protocol scheme (http://) and embedded
 user + password.
 
 The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
 option.

+libcurl respects the proxy environment variables named \fBhttp_proxy\fP,
+\fBftp_proxy\fP, \fBsftp_proxy\fP etc. If set, libcurl will use the specified
+proxy for that URL scheme. So for a "FTP://" URL, the \fBftp_proxy\fP is
+considered. \fBall_proxy\fP is used if no protocol specific proxy was set.
+
+If \fBno_proxy\fP (or \fBNO_PROXY\fP) is set, it can specify a list of host
+names to not use a proxy for (even if one of the previous mention variables
+are set). That is the exact equivalent of setting the \fICURLOPT_NOPROXY(3)\fP
+option.
+
+The \fICURLOPT_PROXY(3)\fP option overrides environment variables.
 .SH DEFAULT
 Default is NULL, meaning no proxy is used.
 
 When you set a host name to use, do not assume that there's any particular
 single port number used widely for proxies. Specify it!
 .SH PROTOCOLS
 All except file://. Note that some protocols don't do very well over proxy.
 .SH EXAMPLE
-TODO
+.nf
+CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
+if(curl) {
+  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/file.txt");
+  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY, "http://proxy:80");
+  curl_easy_perform(curl);
+}
+.fi
 .SH AVAILABILITY
 Since 7.14.1 the proxy environment variable names can include the protocol
 scheme.
 
 Since 7.21.7 the proxy string supports the socks protocols as "schemes".

 .SH NAME
 CURLOPT_SSL_FALSESTART \- enable TLS false start
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSL_FALSESTART, long enable);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-Pass a long as parameter set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable.
+Pass a long as parameter set to 1L to enable or 0 to disable.
 
 This option determines whether libcurl should use false start during the TLS
 handshake. False start is a mode where a TLS client will start sending
 application data before verifying the server's Finished message, thus saving a
 round trip when performing a full handshake.
 .SH DEFAULT
 0
 .SH PROTOCOLS
 All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.
 .SH EXAMPLE
-TODO
+.nf
+CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
+if(curl) {
+  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
+  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_FALSESTART, 1L);
+  curl_easy_perform(curl);
+}
+.fi
 .SH AVAILABILITY
 Added in 7.42.0. This option is currently only supported by the NSS and
 Secure Transport (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) TLS backends.
 .SH RETURN VALUE
 Returns CURLE_OK if false start is supported by the SSL backend, otherwise
 returns CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN.

 .SH NAME
 CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY \- set the TCP_NODELAY option
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY, long nodelay);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a long specifying whether the TCP_NODELAY option is to be set or cleared
-(1 = set, 0 = clear). The option is set by default. This will have no effect
+(1L = set, 0 = clear). The option is set by default. This will have no effect
 after the connection has been established.
 
-Setting this option will disable TCP's Nagle algorithm. The purpose of this
-algorithm is to try to minimize the number of small packets on the network
-(where "small packets" means TCP segments less than the Maximum Segment Size
-(MSS) for the network).
+Setting this option to 1L will disable TCP's Nagle algorithm on this
+connection. The purpose of this algorithm is to try to minimize the number of
+small packets on the network (where "small packets" means TCP segments less
+than the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for the network).
 
 Maximizing the amount of data sent per TCP segment is good because it
 amortizes the overhead of the send. However, in some cases small segments may
 need to be sent without delay. This is less efficient than sending larger
 amounts of data at a time, and can contribute to congestion on the network if
 overdone.

 LDAP
 
   If you have installed the OpenLDAP library, curl can take advantage of it
   and offer ldap:// support.
+  On Windows, curl will use WinLDAP from Platform SDK by default.
+
+  Default protocol version used by curl is LDAPv3. LDAPv2 will be used as
+  fallback mechanism in case if LDAPv3 will fail to connect.
 
   LDAP is a complex thing and writing an LDAP query is not an easy task. I do
   advise you to dig up the syntax description for that elsewhere. One such
   place might be:

   (enforce ASCII) flag.
 
+  You also can use authentication when accessing LDAP catalog:
+

+      curl "ldap://user:passwd@ldap.frontec.se/o=frontec??sub?mail=*"
+
+  By default, if user and password provided, OpenLDAP/WinLDAP will use basic
+  authentication. On Windows you can control this behavior by providing 
+  one of --basic, --ntlm or --digest option in curl command line
+
+      curl --ntlm "ldap://user:passwd@ldap.frontec.se/o=frontec??sub?mail=*"
+
+  On Windows, if no user/password specified, auto-negotiation mechanism will

 Disable the check for and use of valgrind.
 .IP "-p"
 Prints out all files in "log/" to stdout when a test case fails. Very
 practical when used in the automated and distributed tests since then the
 people checking the failures and the reasons for them might not have physical
 access to the machine and logs.
+.IP "-R"
+Run the tests in a scrambled, or randomized, order instead of sequentially.
 .IP "-r"
 Display run time statistics. (Requires Perl Time::HiRes module)
 .IP "-rf"
 Display full run time statistics. (Requires Perl Time::HiRes module)
 .IP "-s"
 Shorter output. Speaks less than default.
