-Daniel Stenberg (22 Dec 2016)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: curl 7.52.1
+Daniel Stenberg (22 Feb 2017)
+- release: 7.53.0
 
-- lib557.c: use a shorter MAXIMIZE representation
+- cookie: fix declaration of 'dup' shadows a global declaration
+
+- TLS: make SSL_VERIFYSTATUS work again
   
-  Since several compilers had problems with the previous one
+  The CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS option was not properly handled by libcurl
+  and thus even if the status couldn't be verified, the connection would
+  be allowed and the user would not be told about the failed verification.

-  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2016-12/0098.html
-
-- runtests: remove the valgrind parser
+  Regression since cb4e2be7c6d42ca
   
-  Old legacy parsing that 1) hid problems for us and 2) probably isn't
-  needed anymore.
+  CVE-2017-2629

+- digest_sspi: Handle 'stale=TRUE' directive in HTTP digest
+  
+  - If the server has provided another challenge use it as the replacement
+    input token if stale=TRUE. Otherwise previous credentials have failed
+    so return CURLE_LOGIN_DENIED.
+  
+  Prior to this change the stale directive was ignored and if another
+  challenge was received it would cause error CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING.

-  warning C4701: potentially uninitialized local variable 'path' used
+  - on the first invocation: keep security context returned by

-  schannel: fix wildcard cert name validation on Win CE
+- RELEASE-PROCEDURE: update the upcoming release calendar
+
+- TODO: consider file name from the redirected URL with -O ?
   
-  Fixes a few issues in manual wildcard cert name validation in
-  schannel support code for Win32 CE:
-  - when comparing the wildcard name to the hostname, the wildcard
-    character was removed from the cert name and the hostname
-    was checked to see if it ended with the modified cert name.
-    This allowed cert names like *.com to match the connection
-    hostname. This violates recommendations from RFC 6125.
-  - when the wildcard name in the certificate is longer than the
-    connection hostname, a buffer overread of the connection
-    hostname buffer would occur during the comparison of the
-    certificate name and the connection hostname.
+  It isn't easily solved, but with some thinking someone could probably
+  come up with a working approach?
+  
+  Closes #1241

+  performed as that has already been done. Only run the certificate
+  information extraction when in verbose mode and libcurl was built with

-- CURLOPT_SOCKS_PROXYTYPE: removed
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Feb 2017)
+- CHANGES: spell fix, use correct path to script
+
+- CHANGES.0: removed
   
-  This was added as part of the SOCKS+HTTPS proxy merge but there's no

+  a perl that defaults to LF line endings (eg msysgit). Currently that
+  results in generator output of mixed line endings of CR, LF and CRLF.
+  
+  This change fixes that issue in the most succinct way by opening the
+  files in :crlf text mode even when the perl being used does not default
+  to that mode. (On operating systems that don't have a separate text mode
+  it's essentially a no-op.) The output continues to be in the perl's
+  native line ending.

-  An HTTPS proxy receives all transactions over an SSL/TLS connection.
-  Once a secure connection with the proxy is established, the user agent
-  uses the proxy as usual, including sending CONNECT requests to instruct
-  the proxy to establish a [usually secure] TCP tunnel with an origin

+  schannel: fix wildcard cert name validation on Win CE
   
-  Prior to this change the statistical and informational variables were
-  simply zeroed by calloc on easy init and duphandle. While zero is the
-  correct default value for almost all info variables, there is one where
-  it isn't (filetime initializes to -1).
+  Fixes a few issues in manual wildcard cert name validation in
+  schannel support code for Win32 CE:
+  - when comparing the wildcard name to the hostname, the wildcard
+    character was removed from the cert name and the hostname
+    was checked to see if it ended with the modified cert name.
+    This allowed cert names like *.com to match the connection
+    hostname. This violates recommendations from RFC 6125.
+  - when the wildcard name in the certificate is longer than the
+    connection hostname, a buffer overread of the connection
+    hostname buffer would occur during the comparison of the
+    certificate name and the connection hostname.

-  follow-up to 4f8d0b6f02aa7043. Since the darwinssl code breaks
-  otherwise. If you build without darwinssl 10.5 works fine.
+  Since it now reads responses one byte a time, a loop could be removed

+  now instead only limited to 16K maximum header line lengths.

+  proxy: Support HTTPS proxy and SOCKS+HTTP(s)
   
-  - Warn if OpenSSL is not present.
+  * HTTPS proxies:
   
-  - Use a UTF-8 stream to make the ca-bundle data.
+  An HTTPS proxy receives all transactions over an SSL/TLS connection.
+  Once a secure connection with the proxy is established, the user agent
+  uses the proxy as usual, including sending CONNECT requests to instruct
+  the proxy to establish a [usually secure] TCP tunnel with an origin
+  server. HTTPS proxies protect nearly all aspects of user-proxy
+  communications as opposed to HTTP proxies that receive all requests
+  (including CONNECT requests) in vulnerable clear text.
   
-  - Save the UTF-8 ca-bundle stream as binary so that no BOM is added.
+  With HTTPS proxies, it is possible to have two concurrent _nested_
+  SSL/TLS sessions: the "outer" one between the user agent and the proxy
+  and the "inner" one between the user agent and the origin server
+  (through the proxy). This change adds supports for such nested sessions
+  as well.
   
-  ---
+  A secure connection with a proxy requires its own set of the usual SSL
+  options (their actual descriptions differ and need polishing, see TODO):
   
-  This is a follow-up to d2c6d15 which switched mk-ca-bundle.vbs output to
-  ANSI due to corrupt UTF-8 output, now fixed.
+    --proxy-cacert FILE        CA certificate to verify peer against
+    --proxy-capath DIR         CA directory to verify peer against
+    --proxy-cert CERT[:PASSWD] Client certificate file and password
+    --proxy-cert-type TYPE     Certificate file type (DER/PEM/ENG)
+    --proxy-ciphers LIST       SSL ciphers to use
+    --proxy-crlfile FILE       Get a CRL list in PEM format from the file
+    --proxy-insecure           Allow connections to proxies with bad certs
+    --proxy-key KEY            Private key file name
+    --proxy-key-type TYPE      Private key file type (DER/PEM/ENG)
+    --proxy-pass PASS          Pass phrase for the private key
+    --proxy-ssl-allow-beast    Allow security flaw to improve interop
+    --proxy-sslv2              Use SSLv2
+    --proxy-sslv3              Use SSLv3
+    --proxy-tlsv1              Use TLSv1
+    --proxy-tlsuser USER       TLS username
+    --proxy-tlspassword STRING TLS password
+    --proxy-tlsauthtype STRING TLS authentication type (default SRP)
   
-  This change completes making the default certificate bundle output of
-  mk-ca-bundle.vbs as close as possible to that of mk-ca-bundle.pl, which
-  should make it easier to review any difference between their output.
+  All --proxy-foo options are independent from their --foo counterparts,
+  except --proxy-crlfile which defaults to --crlfile and --proxy-capath
+  which defaults to --capath.

-- multi: force connections to get closed in close_all_connections
+- glob: fix [a-c] globbing regression
   
-  Several independent reports on infinite loops hanging in the
-  close_all_connections() function when closing a multi handle, can be
-  fixed by first marking the connection to get closed before calling
-  Curl_disconnect.
+  Brought in ee4f76606cf
   
-  This is more fixing-the-symptom rather than the underlying problem
-  though.
+  Added test case 1280 to verify

-  curl_multi_remove_handle: fix a double-free
+- Curl_rand: fixed and moved to rand.c
   
-  In short the easy handle needs to be disconnected from its connection at
-  this point since the connection still is serving other easy handles.
+  Now Curl_rand() is made to fail if it cannot get the necessary random
+  level.
   
-  In our app we can reliably reproduce a crash in our http2 stress test
-  that is fixed by this change. I can't easily reproduce the same test in
-  a small example.
+  Changed the proto of Curl_rand() slightly to provide a number of ints at
+  once.
   
-  This is the gdb/asan output:
+  Moved out from vtls, since it isn't a TLS function and vtls provides
+  Curl_ssl_random() for this to use.

+- easy: Initialize info variables on easy init and duphandle
   
-  5 more fixes, 2 more contributors
+  - Call Curl_initinfo on init and duphandle.
+  
+  Prior to this change the statistical and informational variables were
+  simply zeroed by calloc on easy init and duphandle. While zero is the
+  correct default value for almost all info variables, there is one where
+  it isn't (filetime initializes to -1).
+  
+  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/1103
+  Reported-by: Neal Poole
 
-- [Tobias Stoeckmann brought this change]
+Daniel Stenberg (5 Nov 2016)
+- [Mauro Rappa brought this change]
 
-  smb: properly check incoming packet boundaries
+  curl -w: added more decimal digits to timing counters
   
-  Not all reply messages were properly checked for their lengths, which
-  made it possible to access uninitialized memory (but this does not lead
-  to out of boundary accesses).
+  Now showing microsecond resolution.
   
-  Closes #1052
+  Closes #1106
 
-- test557: verify printf() with 128 and 129 arguments

-- mprintf: return error on too many arguments
+Daniel Stenberg (4 Nov 2016)
+- mbedtls: fix build with mbedtls versions < 2.4.0
   
-  128 arguments should be enough for everyone
-
-- ftp: fix Curl_ftpsendf()
+  Regression added in 62a8095e714
   
-  ... it no longer takes printf() arguments since it was only really taken
-  advantage by one user and it was not written and used in a safe
-  way. Thus the 'f' is removed from the function name and the proto is
-  changed.
+  Reported-by: Tony Kelman
   
-  Although the current code wouldn't end up in badness, it was a risk that
-  future changes could end up springf()ing too large data or passing in a
-  format string inadvertently.
+  Discussed in #1087
 
-- formpost: avoid silent snprintf() truncation
+- configure: verify that compiler groks -Werror=partial-availability
   
-  The previous use of snprintf() could make libcurl silently truncate some
-  input data and not report that back on overly large input, which could
-  make data get sent over the network in a bad format.

-  This only excludes building unit tests from default build ( 'all' Make
-  target or "Build Solution" in VisualStudio). The projects and Make
-  targets will still be generated and shown in supporting IDEs.
+  - we allow the security push up to 48 hours before the release
   
-  Fixes https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/981
-  Reported-by: Randy Armstrong
+  - add a mention about possible pre-notifications
   
-  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/990

-  It should work true to the autotools build except it tries to unhide
-  symbols on Windows when requested and prints warning if it fails.

+- mk-ca-bundle: Update the vbscript version
   
-  ... by making sure we don't count down the "upload left" counter when the
-  uploaded size is unknown and then it can be allowed to continue forever.
+  Bring the VBScript version more in line with the perl version:
   
-  Fixes #996
+  - Change timestamp to UTC.
+  
+  - Change URL retrieval to HTTPS-only by default.
+  
+  - Comment out the options that disabled SSL cert checking by default.
+  
+  - Assume OpenSSL is present, get SHA256. And add a flag to toggle it.
+  
+  - Fix cert issuer name output.
+  
+  The cert issuer output is now ansi, converted from UTF-8. Prior to this
+  it was corrupt UTF-8. It turns out though we can work with UTF-8 the
+  FSO object that writes ca-bundle can't write UTF-8, so there will have
+  to be some alternative if UTF-8 is needed (like an ADODB.Stream).
+  
+  - Disable the certificate text info feature.
+  
+  The certificate text info doesn't work properly with any recent OpenSSL.

-  openssl: fix CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT
-  
-  CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT does not get the certificate verification

-  error.
+- INSTALL: converted to markdown => INSTALL.md
   
-  This fix saves the result of SSL_get_verify_result so that it is
-  returned by CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT.
+  Also heavily edited for content. Removed lots of old cruft that we added
+  like 10+ years ago that is likely incorrect by now.

-  speed caps: not based on average speeds anymore
-  
-  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
-  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
-  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
-  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
-  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
-  bursts" (as told in man page).
-  
-  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
-  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
-  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
-  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
-  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
-  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
+- configure/CURL_CHECK_FUNC_POLL: disable poll completely on mac
   
-  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
-  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
-  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
-  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
-  case of sudden speed burst).
+  ... so that the same libcurl build easier can run on any version.

+Marcel Raad (16 Oct 2016)
+- win: fix Universal Windows Platform build
   
-  When we're uploading using FTP and the server issues a tiny pause
-  between opening the connection to the client's secondary socket, the
-  client's initial poll() times out, which leads to second poll() which
-  does not wait for POLLIN on the secondary socket. So that poll() also
-  has to time out, creating a long (200ms) pause.
+  This fixes a merge error in commit 7f3df80 caused by commit 332e8d6.
   
-  This patch adds the correct flag to the secondary socket, making the
-  second poll() correctly wait for the connection there too.
+  Additionally, this changes Curl_verify_windows_version for Windows App
+  builds to assume to always be running on the target Windows version.
+  There seems to be no way to determine the Windows version from a

+- TODO: TCP Fast Open for windows
 
-  curl: allow "pkcs11:" prefix for client certificates
-  
-  RFC7512 provides a standard method to reference certificates in PKCS#11
-  tokens, by means of a URI starting 'pkcs11:'.
-  
-  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
-  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
-  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
-  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.
-  
-  This doesn't work with cURL because of the way that the colon is used
-  to separate the certificate argument from the passphrase. So instead of
-  
-     curl -E 'pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
-  
-  I instead need to invoke cURL with the colon escaped, like this:
-  
-     curl -E 'pkcs11\:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
-  
-  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
-  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
-  differences for different applications.
-  
-  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
-  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
-  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
-  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
-  the URI itself.
-  
-  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
-  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
-  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
-  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
-  
-  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
-  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
-  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
-  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

+  RC4 was a nice alternative to CBC back in the days of BEAST, but it's insecure and obsolete now.

-  Sample use for clcache:
-  set CC=clcache.bat
-  nmake /f Makefile.vc DEBUG=no MODE=static VC=14 GEN_PDB=no
+  Since I first wrote that text, Apple introduced tvOS and watchOS, and renamed "Mac OS X" to "macOS." Let's make the text a little more inclusive, since curl can be built for all four operating systems.

-  Apparently due to a broken homebrew install
+  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
+  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
+  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
+  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it

-
-  win32: fix a potential memory leak in Curl_load_library
+  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
+  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
+  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
+  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
+  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
+  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
   
-  If a call to GetSystemDirectory fails, the `path` pointer that was
-  previously allocated would be leaked. This makes sure that `path` is
-  always freed.
+  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
+  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
+  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
+  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
+  case of sudden speed burst).

-  - Curl_ipv6works() is not thread-safe until after the first call, so
-  call it once during global init to avoid a possible race condition.
+  Serialise the call to PK11_FindSlotByName() to avoid spurious errors in
+  a multi-threaded environment. The underlying cause is a race condition

+  ftp: fix wrong poll on the secondary socket
   
-  - the expression of an 'if' was always true
-  - a 'while' contained a condition that was always true
-  - use 'if(k->exp100 > EXP100_SEND_DATA)' instead of 'if(k->exp100)'
-  - fixed a typo
+  When we're uploading using FTP and the server issues a tiny pause
+  between opening the connection to the client's secondary socket, the
+  client's initial poll() times out, which leads to second poll() which
+  does not wait for POLLIN on the secondary socket. So that poll() also

-  Prior to this change we called Curl_ssl_getsessionid and
-  Curl_ssl_addsessionid regardless of whether session ID reusing was
-  enabled. According to comments that is in case session ID reuse was
-  disabled but then later enabled.
+  As Windows SSPI authentication calls fail when a particular mechanism
+  isn't available, introduced these functions for DIGEST, NTLM, Kerberos 5
+  and Negotiate to allow both HTTP and SASL authentication the opportunity
+  to query support for a supported mechanism before selecting it.
   
-  The old way was not intuitive and probably not something users expected.
-  When a user disables session ID caching I'd guess they don't expect the
-  session ID to be cached anyway in case the caching is later enabled.
+  For now each function returns TRUE to maintain compatability with the
+  existing code when called.

-  cmake: now using BUILD_TESTING=ON/OFF
+  curl: allow "pkcs11:" prefix for client certificates
   
-  CMake build now using BUILD_TESTING=ON/OFF (default is OFF) to build
-  tests and enabling CTest integration. Options BUILD_CURL_TESTS and
-  BUILD_DASHBOARD_REPORTS was removed.
+  RFC7512 provides a standard method to reference certificates in PKCS#11
+  tokens, by means of a URI starting 'pkcs11:'.
   
-  Closes #882
+  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
+  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
+  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
+  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.
+  
+  This doesn't work with cURL because of the way that the colon is used
+  to separate the certificate argument from the passphrase. So instead of
+  
+     curl -E 'pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  
+  I instead need to invoke cURL with the colon escaped, like this:
+  
+     curl -E 'pkcs11\:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  
+  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
+  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
+  differences for different applications.
+  
+  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
+  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
+  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
+  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
+  the URI itself.
+  
+  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
+  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
+  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
+  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
   
-  Reviewed-by: Brad King
+  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
+  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
+  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
+  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

-- curl-compilers.m4: improve detection of GCC's -fvisibility= flag
+- proxy: fix tests as follow-up to 93b0d907d5
   
-  Some builds of GCC produce output on both stdout and stderr when --help
-  --verbose is used.  The 2>&1 redirection caused them to be arbitrarily
-  interleaved with each other because of stream buffering.  Consequently,
-  grep failed to match the fvisibility= string in the mixed output, even
-  though the string was present in GCC's standard output.
+  This fixes tests that were added after 113f04e664b as the tests would
+  fail otherwise.
   
-  This led to silently disabling symbol hiding in some builds of curl.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (19 Jun 2016)
-- tests: fix the HTTP/2 tests
+  We bring back "Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive" now unconditionally to fix
+  regressions with old and stupid proxies, but we could possibly switch to
+  using it only for CONNECT or only for NTLM in a future if we want to
+  gradually reduce it.
   
-  The HTTP/2 tests brought with commit bf05606ef1f were using the internal
-  name 'http2' for the HTTP/2 server, while in fact that name was already
-  used for the second instance of the HTTP server. This made tests using
-  the second instance (like test 2050) fail after a HTTP/2 test had run.
+  Fixes #954
   
-  The server is now known as HTTP/2 internally and within the <server>
-  section in test cases. 1700, 1701 and 1702 were updated accordingly.

+  
+  I discovered some people have been using "https://example.com" style

+  
+  I think this misleads users into believing curl uses HTTPS to proxies

+  schemes instead of just ignoring and defaulting to HTTP.

-- tool_urlglob: fix off-by-one error in glob_parse()
-  
-  ... causing SIGSEGV while parsing URL with too many globs.
-  Minimal example:
+  winbuild: Free name $(CC) in Makefile (#950)
   
-  $ curl $(for i in $(seq 101); do printf '{a}'; done)
+  In the old line number 290, CC and CURL_CC had the same value. After
+  that, /DCURL_STATICLIB was added to CC but not CURL_CC (intended?).
   
-  Reported-by: Romain Coltel
-  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1340757
+  This gets rid of the CC variable entirely. It is a first step to make it
+  possible to manualyl set a CC variable in order to be able to change the
+  compiler.

-- [Ivan Avdeev brought this change]
+  This change is similar to what we already do in the autotools build.
 
-  vtls: fix ssl session cache race condition
+- cmake: Enable win32 large file support by default
   
-  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
-  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
-  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
-  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
-  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
-  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
-  This commit:
-   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
-     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
-   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
-     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
-   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
-     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
-     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
-     this race.
+  All compilers used by cmake in Windows should support large files.
   
-  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/815
-  Fixes #815
-  Closes #847
+  - Add test SIZEOF_OFF_T
+  - Remove outdated test SIZEOF_CURL_OFF_T

-  Fixes #842
+  In order to make MBEDTLS_DEBUG work, the debug threshold must be unequal
+  to 0.  This patch also adds a comment how mbedtls must be compiled in
+  order to make debugging work, and explains the possible debug levels.
 
-- URL parser: allow URLs to use one, two or three slashes
-  
-  Mostly in order to support broken web sites that redirect to broken URLs
-  that are accepted by browsers.
+- CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY: now enabled by default
   
-  Browsers are typically even more leniant than this as the WHATWG URL
-  spec they should allow an _infinite_ amount. I tested 8000 slashes with
-  Firefox and it just worked.
+  After a few wasted hours hunting down the reason for slowness during a
+  TLS handshake that turned out to be because of TCP_NODELAY not being
+  set, I think we have enough motivation to toggle the default for this
+  option. We now enable TCP_NODELAY by default and allow applications to
+  switch it off.
   
-  Added test case 1141, 1142 and 1143 to verify the new parser.
+  This also makes --tcp-nodelay unnecessary, but --no-tcp-nodelay can be
+  used to disable it.

-- [Marcel Raad brought this change]
+- multi: make Curl_expire() work with 0 ms timeouts
+  
+  Previously, passing a timeout of zero to Curl_expire() was a magic code
+  for clearing all timeouts for the handle. That is now instead made with
+  the new Curl_expire_clear() function and thus a 0 timeout is fine to set
+  and will trigger a timeout ASAP.
+  
+  This will help removing short delays, in particular notable when doing
+  HTTP/2.

+  Regression added in 790d6de48515. The was then added to avoid one
+  particular transfer to starve out others. But when aborting due to
+  reading the maxcount, the connection must be marked to be read from
+  again without first doing a select as for some protocols (like SFTP/SCP)
+  the data may already have been read off the socket.

-  To make the aliases list reflect reality.
+  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
+  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
+  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
+  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
+  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
+  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
+  This commit:
+   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
+     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
+   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
+     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
+   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
+     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
+     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
+     this race.

+  TLS: SSL_peek is not a const operation
   
-  - Make sure each header line ends in \r\n. This fixes an out of bounds.
+  Calling SSL_peek can cause bytes to be read from the raw socket which in
+  turn can upset the select machinery that determines whether there's data
+  available on the socket.
   
-  - Disallow header continuation lines until we decide what to do.
+  Since Curl_ossl_check_cxn only tries to determine whether the socket is
+  alive and doesn't actually need to see the bytes SSL_peek seems like
+  the wrong function to call.

+
+  connect: fix invalid "Network is unreachable" errors
   
-  This commit ensures that streams which was closed in on_stream_close
-  callback gets passed to http2_handle_stream_close.  Previously, this
-  might not happen.  To achieve this, we increment drain property to
-  forcibly call recv function for that stream.
+  Sometimes, in systems with both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses but where the
+  network doesn't support ipv6, Curl_is_connected returns an error
+  (intermittently) even if the ipv4 socket connects successfully.
   
-  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
-  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into
-  http_conn.drain_total.  We only shutdown session if that value is 0.
+  This happens because there's a for-loop that iterates on the sockets but
+  the error variable is not resetted when the ipv4 is checked and is ok.
   
-  With this commit, when stream was closed before reading response
-  header fields, error code CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM is returned even if
-  HTTP/2 level error is NO_ERROR.  This signals the upper layer that
-  stream was closed by error just like TCP connection close in HTTP/1.
+  This patch fixes this problem by setting error to 0 when checking the
+  second socket and not having a result yet.

-  Prior to this change, we were generating the output token when the

+  the first configure run with caching.
   
-  Prior to this change, we were generating the SPN in the SSPI code when

+  forcibly call recv function for that stream.

-  does not attempt to install the zsh completion script as we've not yet
-  found a proper way to do/run that at install time.
+  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
+  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into

-  By leaving the script dir's Makefile in place, a user can still opt to
-  run make install manually in there.
+  With this commit, when stream was closed before reading response
+  header fields, error code CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM is returned even if

-- url: don't use bad offset in tld_check_name to show error
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Apr 2016)
+- http2: drain the socket better...
   
-  libidn's tld_check_lz returns an error offset of the first character
-  that it failed to process, however that offset is not a byte offset and
-  may not even be in the locale encoding therefore we can't use it to show
-  the user the character that failed to process.
+  ... but ignore EAGAIN if the stream has ended so that we don't end up in
+  a loop. This is a follow-up to c8ab613 in order to avoid the problem
+  d261652 was made to fix.

-  Introduced in commit ca5f9341ef this happens because a char*, which is

-  64-bits wide where 64-bit integers are supported by the compiler.

-Pass a long with this option to set type of the proxy. Available options for
-this are \fICURLPROXY_HTTP\fP, \fICURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0\fP
-\fICURLPROXY_SOCKS4\fP, \fICURLPROXY_SOCKS5\fP, \fICURLPROXY_SOCKS4A\fP and

+Pass one of the values below to set the type of the proxy.
 
-If you set \fICURLOPT_PROXYTYPE(3)\fP to \fICURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0\fP, it will
-only affect how libcurl speaks to a proxy when CONNECT is used. The HTTP
-version used for "regular" HTTP requests is instead controlled with
-\fICURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION(3)\fP.

+.IP CURLPROXY_HTTP
+HTTP Proxy. Default.
+.IP CURLPROXY_HTTPS
+HTTPS Proxy. (Added in 7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS)
+.IP CURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0
+HTTP 1.0 Proxy. This is very similar to CURLPROXY_HTTP except it uses HTTP/1.0
+for any CONNECT tunnelling. It does not change the HTTP version of the actual
+HTTP requests, controlled by \fICURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION(3)\fP.

 =================================
 
 Roadmap of things Daniel Stenberg and Steve Holme want to work on next. It is
 intended to serve as a guideline for others for information, feedback and
 possible participation.
 
-HTTP/2
-------
-
-Improve performance. Measurements and tests have shown that in several cases
-doing transfers over HTTP/2 can be notably slower than the same transfer done
-over HTTP/1. Some of that difference can be attributed the inefficient window
-size handling currently in use but there are probably more to be learned and
-worked on to optimize this.
-
 QUIC
 ----
 
 The standardization process of QUIC has been taken to the IETF and can be
 followed on the [IETF QUIC Mailing
 list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/quic). I'd like us to get on the
 bandwagon. Ideally, this would be done with a separate library/project to
 handle the binary/framing layer in a similar fashion to how HTTP/2 is
 implemented. This, to allow other projects to benefit from the work and to
 thus broaden the interest and chance of others to participate.
 
-TLS 1.3
--------
-
-The new version of the TLS protocol is in the pipeline and will soon start to
-get used out in the wild. It offers some new interesting features and will
-need the TLS libraries to adapt and quite likely provide additional or
-modified APIs. libcurl needs to adapt accordingly.

 HTTP cookies

 support them as the popular browsers will as well:

  work and how to login to them using curl.
 
  It can also be noted that to do this properly in an automated fashion, you
  will most certainly need to script things and do multiple curl invokes etc.
 
  First, servers mostly use cookies to track the logged-in status of the
  client, so you will need to capture the cookies you receive in the
  responses. Then, many sites also set a special cookie on the login page (to
  make sure you got there through their login page) so you should make a habit
  of first getting the login-form page to capture the cookies set there.

  manually, capturing the HTTP requests done by your browsers and analyzing the
  sent cookies is usually a working method to work out how to shortcut the
