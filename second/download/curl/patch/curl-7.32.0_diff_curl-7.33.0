-- [Fabian Keil brought this change]
+Daniel Stenberg (13 Oct 2013)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 92cf6141ed0de
 
-  test1228: add 'HTTP proxy' to the keywords
+- curl: fix --oauth2-bearer in the --help output
+  
+  After the option rename in 5df04bfafd1
 
-- [Fabian Keil brought this change]
+- OpenSSL: improve the grammar of the language in 39beaa5ffbcc
+  
+  Reported-by: Petr Pisar
 
-  tests: add keywords for a couple of FILE tests
+- [Andrej E Baranov brought this change]
 
-- [Fabian Keil brought this change]
+  OpenSSL: use failf() when subjectAltName mismatches
+  
+  Write to CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER information about mismatch alternative
+  certificate subject names.
+  
+  Signed-off-by: Andrej E Baranov <admin@andrej-andb.ru>
 
-  tests: add 'FAILURE' keywords to tests 1409 and 1410
+- curl: rename --bearer to --oauth2-bearer
+  
+  The option '--bearer' might be slightly ambiguous in name. It doesn't
+  create any conflict that I am aware of at the moment, however, OAUTH v2
+  is not the only authentication mechanism which uses "bearer" tokens.
+  
+  Reported-by: Kyle L. Huff
+  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-10/0064.html
 
-- [Fabian Keil brought this change]
+- [Kamil Dudka brought this change]
 
-  tests: add keywords for a couple of HTTP tests
+  ssh: improve the logic for detecting blocking direction
+  
+  This fixes a regression introduced by commit 0feeab78 limiting the speed
+  of SCP upload to 16384 B/s on a fast connection (such as localhost).
 
-- [Fabian Keil brought this change]
+Dan Fandrich (12 Oct 2013)
+- Fixed typo in Makefile.inc that left http2.h out of the tar ball
 
-  tests: add keywords for a couple of FTP tests
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Oct 2013)
+- [Heinrich Schaefer brought this change]
 
-- [Fabian Keil brought this change]
+  minor fix in doc
 
-  test1511: consistently terminate headers with CRLF
+- [Gisle Vanem brought this change]
 
-- DISABLED: shut of test 1512 for now
+  curl_setup_once: fix errno access for lwip on Windows
   
-  It shows intermittent failures and I haven't been able to track them
-  down yet. Disable this test for now.
+  lib/curl_setup_once.h assumed lwIP on Windows uses 'SetLastError()' to
+  set network errors. It doesn't; it uses 'errno'.
 
-- curl_multi_add_handle.3: ... that timer callback is for event-based
+- test1239: verify 4cd444e01ad and the simulated 304 response
 
-- comments: remove old and wrong multi/easy interface statements
+- [Derek Higgins brought this change]
 
-- curl_multi_add_handle.3: mention the CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION use
+  HTTP: Output http response 304 when modified time is too old
+  
+  When using the -w '%{http_code}' flag and simulating a Not Modified then
+  304 should be output.
 
-- [John E. Malmberg brought this change]
+- contributors: helper script to dig out contributors from git
 
-  KNOWN_BUGS: 22 and 57 have been fixed and committed

-- global dns cache: fix memory leak
+Nick Zitzmann (2 Oct 2013)
+- darwinssl: block TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256 cipher
   
-  The take down of the global dns cache didn't take CURLOPT_RESOLVE names
-  into account.
+  Credit (for catching a cipher I forgot to add to the blocked ciphers list):
+  https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html
 
-- global dns cache: didn't work [regression]
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Oct 2013)
+- OpenSSL: acknowledge CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST without VERIFYPEER
   
-  CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE broke in commit c43127414d89ccb (been
-  broken since the libcurl 7.29.0 release). While this option has been
-  documented as deprecated for almost a decade and nobody even reported
-  this bug, it should remain functional.
+  Setting only CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST without CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER set
+  should still verify that the host name fields in the server certificate
+  is fine or return failure.
   
-  Added test case 1512 to verify

+  Reported-by: Ishan SinghLevett
 
-  packages/vms: update VMS build files
+- KNOWN_BUGS: #84: CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT
   
-  VMS modified files either missing from a previous commit and changes
-  to remove references to CVS repositories.
+  CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT is only implemented for the OpenSSL and NSS
+  backends and not for any other!
 
-Daniel Stenberg (8 Aug 2013)
-- FTP: renamed several local functions
-  
-  The previous naming scheme ftp_state_post_XXXX() wasn't really helpful
-  as it wasn't always immediately after 'xxxx' and it wasn't easy to
-  understand what it does based on such a name.
-  
-  This new one is instead ftp_state_yyyy() where yyyy describes what it
-  does or sends.
+- [FranÃ§ois Charlier brought this change]
 
-- mk-ca-bundle.1: don't install on make install
-  
-  Since the mk-ca-bundle tool itself isn't installed with make install,
-  there's no point in installing its documentation.
-  
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-08/0057.html
-  Reported-by: Guenter Knauf
+  xattr: add support for FreeBSD xattr API

-- FTP: when EPSV gets a 229 but fails to connect, retry with PASV
+- win32: fix Visual Studio 2010 build with WINVER >= 0x600
   
-  This is a regression as this logic used to work. It isn't clear when it
-  broke, but I'm assuming in 7.28.0 when we went all-multi internally.
+  If no WINVER and/or _WIN32_IWNNT define was set, the Windows platform
+  SDK often defaults to high value, e.g. 0x601 (whoch may probably depend
+  on the Windows version being used, in my case Windows 7).
   
-  This likely never worked with the multi interface. As the failed
-  connection is detected once the multi state has reached DO_MORE, the
-  Curl_do_more() function was now expanded somewhat so that the
-  ftp_do_more() function can request to go "back" to the previous state
-  when it makes another attempt - using PASV.
+  If WINVER >= 0x600 then winsock2.h includes some defines for WSAPoll(),
+  e.g. POLLIN, POLLPRI, POLLOUT etc. These defines clash with cURL's
+  lib/select.h.
   
-  Added test case 1233 to verify this fix. It has the little issue that it
-  assumes no service is listening/accepting connections on port 1...
+  Make sure HAVE_STRUCT_POLLFD is defined then.

-  The internal function that's used to detect known file extensions for

-  CURLFORM_BUFFER + CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR were used. This had the effect that
-  strlen() would be used which could lead to an out-of-bounds read (and
-  thus segfault). In most cases it would only lead to it not finding or
-  using the correct default content-type.
+  Moved the standard SASL mechanism strings into curl_sasl.h rather than
+  hard coding the same values over and over again in the protocols that
+  use SASL authentication.
   
-  It also showed that test 554 and test 587 were testing for the
-  previous/wrong behavior and now they're updated as well.

+  test1112: Increase the timeout from 7s to 16s
   
-  Instead of claiming it is an error, we call it a "note" to reduce the
-  severity level. But the following text now says the [variable] "*should*
-  only be used to specify"... instead of previously having said "may".
+  As someone reported on the mailing list a while back, the hard-coded
+  arbitrary timeout of 7s in test 1112 is not sufficient in some build
+  environments. At Arista Networks we build and test curl as part of our
+  automated build system, and we've run into this timeout 170 times so
+  far. Our build servers are typically quite busy building and testing a
+  lot of code in parallel, so despite being beefy machines with 32 cores
+  and 128GB of RAM we still hit this 7s timeout regularly.

-- multi: remove data->state.current_conn struct field
+Steve Holme (22 Sep 2013)
+- tests: Fixed smtp rcpt to addresses
+
+- ftpserver.pl: Expanded the SMTP RCPT handler to validate TO addresses
   
-  Not needed
+  RCPT_smtp() will now check for a correctly formatted TO address which
+  allows for invalid recipient addresses to be added.
 
-- multi: remove the one_easy struct field
+- ftpserver.pl: Added cURL SMTP server detection to HELO command handler
   
-  Since the merge of SessionHandle with Curl_one_easy, this indirection
-  isn't used anymore.
+  As curl will send a HELO command after an negative EHLO response, added
+  the same detection from commit b07709f7417c3e to the HELO handler to
+  ensure the test server is identified correctly and an upload isn't
+  performed.
 
-- multi: rename all Curl_one_easy to SessionHandle
+- ftpserver.pl: Corrected response code for successful RCPT command
 
-- multi: remove the multi_pos struct field
+- ftpserver.pl: Moved invalid RCPT TO: address detection to RCPT handler
   
-  Since Curl_one_easy is really a SessionHandle now, this indirection
-  doesn't exist anymore.
+  Rather than detecting the TO address as missing in the DATA handler,
+  moved the detection to the RCPT command handler where an error response
+  can be generated.
 
-- multi: remove easy_handle struct field
+- RELEASE-NOTES: Corrected missed addition
   
-  It isn't needed anymore
+  Somehow commit 60a20461629fda missed the last item in the sync list
+  even though I'm sure I added it during editing.
 
-- multi: remove 'Curl_one_easy' struct, phase 1
+- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with 6dd8bd8d2f9729
+
+- curl.1: Added information about optional login options to --user in manpage
   
-  The motivation for having a separate struct that keep track of an easy
-  handle when using the multi handle was removed when we switched to
-  always using the multi interface internally. Now they were just two
-  separate struct that was always allocated for each easy handle.
+  Added missing information, from curl 7.31.0, regarding the use of the
+  optional login options that may be specified as part of --user.
   
-  This first step just moves the Curl_one_easy struct members into the
-  SessionHandle struct and hides this somehow (== keeps the source code
-  changes to a minimum) by defining Curl_one_easy to SessionHandle
+  For example:
   
-  The biggest changes in this commit are:
+  --user 'user:password;auth=NTLM' in IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols.
+
+- ftpserver.pl: Moved cURL SMTP server detection into EHLO command handler
   
-   1 - the linked list of easy handles had to be changed somewhat due
-       to the new struct layout. This made the main linked list pointer
-       get renamed to 'easyp' and there's also a new pointer to the last
-       node, called easylp. It is no longer circular but ends with ->next
-       pointing to NULL. New nodes are still added last.
+  Moved the special SMTP server detection code from the DATA command
+  handler, which happens further down the operation chain after EHLO,
+  MAIL and RCPT commands, to the EHLO command as it is the first command
+  to be generated by a SMTP operation as well as containing the special
+  "verifiedserver" string from the URL.
   
-   2 - easy->state is now called easy->mstate to avoid name collision
+  This not only makes it easier and quicker to detect but also means that
+  cURL doesn't need to specify "verifiedserver" as --mail-from and
+  --mail-rcpt arguments.
+  
+  More importantly, this also makes the upcoming verification changes to
+  the RCPT handler easier to implement.

-  This reverts commit 82ab5f1b0c7c3f as this was the wrong place to
-  document the complexity of IMAP URLs and Custom Requests.
+  In ossl_connect_step2() when the "Unknown SSL protocol error" occurs, it
+  would output the local port number instead of the remote one which

-- DOCS: Added IMAP URL example for listing new messages

+  The libcurl date parser returns INT_MAX for all dates > 2037 so this

+  committed the POP3 server will regenerate the message numbers in the
+  next session to be contiguous again. As such our LIST response should
+  list message numbers contiguously until we support a DELE command in the
+  same session.
   
-  Reported-by: Evgeny Turnaev
+  Should a POP3 user require the unique message ID for any or all

-- Reinstate "WIN32 MemoryTracking: track wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() usage".
+- [Petr PÃ­saÅ brought this change]
+
+  Pass password to OpenSSL engine by user interface
   
-  This reverts commit 7ed25cc, reinstating commit 8ec2cb5.
+  Recent OpenSSL uses user interface abstraction to negotiate access to
+  private keys in the cryprographical engines. An OpenSSL application is
+  expected to implement the user interface. Otherwise a default one
+  provided by OpenSSL (interactive standard I/O) will be used and the
+  aplication will have no way how to pass a password to the engine.
   
-  As of 18-jul-2013 we still do have code in libcurl that makes use of these
-  memory functions. Commit 8ec2cb5 comment still applies and is yet valid.
+  Longer-desc: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-08/0265.html
+
+- urlglob: improved error messages and column number on bad use
   
-  These memory functions are solely used in Windows builds, so all related
-  code is protected with '#ifdef WIN32' preprocessor conditional compilation
-  directives.
+  Introduce a convenience macro and keep of the column better so that it
+  can point out the offending column better.
   
-  Specifically, wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used when building a Windows target with
-  UNICODE and USE_WINDOWS_SSPI preprocessor symbols defined. This is the case
-  when building a Windows UNICODE target with Windows native SSL/TLS support
-  enabled.
+  Updated test 75 accordingly.
+
+- urlglob: avoid error code translation
   
-  Realizing that wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used is a bit tricky given that usage
-  of these is hidden behind _tcsdup() which is MS way of dealing with code
-  that must tolerate UNICODE and non-UNICODE compilation. Additionally, MS
-  header files and those compatible from other compilers use this preprocessor
-  conditional compilation directive in order to select at compilation time
-  whether 'wide' or 'ansi' MS API functions are used.
+  By using the correct values from the start we don't have to translate
+  them!
+
+- urlglob: avoid NULL pointer dereference
   
-  Without this code, Windows build targets with Windows native SSL/TLS support
-  enabled and MemoryTracking support enabled misbehave in tracking memory usage,
-  regardless of being a UNICODE enabled build or not.

-  If a program would give a string like "%FF" to curl_easy_unescape() but

-  making the counter wrap. Continuing this, the function would go on

-  buffer...

+  "[0-1]{"
   
-  In the pkcs12 code, we get a list of x509 records returned from
-  PKCS12_parse but when iterating over the list and passing each to
-  SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert() we didn't also properly remove them from
-  the "stack", which made them get freed twice (both in sk_X509_pop_free()
-  and then later in SSL_CTX_free).
+  2 - curl wouldn't properly reject empty lists so that "{}{}" would
+  result in curl getting (nil) strings in the output.
   
-  This isn't really documented anywhere...
+  3 - By using strtoul() instead of sscanf() the code will now detected
+  over and underflows. It now also better parses the step argument to only
+  accept positive numbers and only step counters that is smaller than the
+  delta between the maximum and minimum numbers.

-  We found that in specific cases if the connection is abruptly closed,
-  the underlying socket is listed in a close_wait state. We continue to
-  call the curl_multi_perform, curl_mutli_fdset etc. None of these APIs
-  report the socket closed / connection finished.  Since we have cases
-  where the multi connection is only used once, this can pose a problem
-  for us. I've read that if another connection was to come in, curl would
-  see the socket as bad and attempt to close it at that time -
-  unfortunately, this does not work for us.
-  
-  I found that in specific situations, if SSL_write returns 0, curl did
-  not recognize the socket as closed (or errored out) and did not report
-  it to the application. I believe we need to change the code slightly, to
-  check if ssl_write returns 0. If so, treat it as an error - the same as
-  a negative return code.
-  
-  For OpenSSL - the ssl_write documentation is here:

+     b. VMS text files are read once to get the correct size
+        and then converted to line-feed terminated records as

-  Updated the default behaviour of sending the client's initial response in the AUTH

-  specify including the response.
+  The default VMS text formats do not contain either line-feed or

+  This reverts commit 7ed25cc, reinstating commit 8ec2cb5.
+  
+  As of 18-jul-2013 we still do have code in libcurl that makes use of these
+  memory functions. Commit 8ec2cb5 comment still applies and is yet valid.
+  
+  These memory functions are solely used in Windows builds, so all related
+  code is protected with '#ifdef WIN32' preprocessor conditional compilation
+  directives.
+  
+  Specifically, wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used when building a Windows target with
+  UNICODE and USE_WINDOWS_SSPI preprocessor symbols defined. This is the case
+  when building a Windows UNICODE target with Windows native SSL/TLS support
+  enabled.
+  
+  Realizing that wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used is a bit tricky given that usage
+  of these is hidden behind _tcsdup() which is MS way of dealing with code
+  that must tolerate UNICODE and non-UNICODE compilation. Additionally, MS
+  header files and those compatible from other compilers use this preprocessor
+  conditional compilation directive in order to select at compilation time
+  whether 'wide' or 'ansi' MS API functions are used.
+  
+  Without this code, Windows build targets with Windows native SSL/TLS support
+  enabled and MemoryTracking support enabled misbehave in tracking memory usage,
+  regardless of being a UNICODE enabled build or not.

-- sasl: Added predefined preferred mechanism values
+- formpost: better random boundaries
   
-  In preparation for the upcoming changes to IMAP, POP3 and SMTP added
-  preferred mechanism values.
-
-- url: Added support for parsing login options from the URL
+  When doing multi-part formposts, libcurl used a pseudo-random value that
+  was seeded with time(). This turns out to be bad for users who formpost
+  data that is provided with users who then can guess how the boundary
+  string will look like and then they can forge a different formpost part
+  and trick the receiver.
   
-  As well as parsing the username and password from the URL, added support
-  for parsing the optional options part from the login details, to allow
-  the following supported URL format:
+  My advice to such implementors is (still even after this change) to not
+  rely on the boundary strings being cryptographically strong. Fix your
+  code and logic to not depend on them that much!
+  
+  I moved the Curl_rand() function into the sslgen.c source file now to be
+  able to take advantage of the SSL library's random function if it
+  provides one. If not, try to use the RANDOM_FILE for seeding and as a
+  last resort keep the old logic, just modified to also add microseconds
+  which makes it harder to properly guess the exact seed.
   
-  schema://username:password;options@example.com/path?q=foobar
+  The formboundary() function in formdata.c is now using 64 bit entropy
+  for the boundary and therefore the string of dashes was reduced by 4
+  letters and there are 16 hex digits following it. The total length is
+  thus still the same.
   
-  This will only be used by IMAP, POP3 and SMTP at present but any
-  protocol that may be given login options in the URL will be able to
-  add support for them.

+  When the c-ares based resolver backend failed to resolve a name, it

+- multi_socket: react on socket close immediately
   
-  added "tcpkeepalive on Mac OS X"

-Nick Zitzmann (8 Apr 2013)
-- darwinssl: disable insecure ciphers by default
+  As a remedy to the problem when a socket gets closed and a new one is
+  opened with the same file descriptor number and as a result
+  multi.c:singlesocket() doesn't detect the difference, the new function
+  Curl_multi_closed() gets told when a socket is closed so that it can be
+  removed from the socket hash. When the old one has been removed, a new
+  socket should be detected fine by the singlesocket() on next invoke.
   
-  I noticed that aria2's SecureTransport code disables insecure ciphers such
-  as NULL, anonymous, IDEA, and weak-key ciphers used by SSLv3 and later.
-  That's a good idea, and now we do the same thing in order to prevent curl
-  from accessing a "secure" site that only negotiates insecure ciphersuites.

-  Since qsort implementations vary with regards to handling the order

-  to detect that the connection was closed by checking that recv returns

-  not closed. This workaround abuses exceptfds in conjunction with
-  readfds to signal that the connection has actually closed.
+  By always returning the md5 for an empty body when auth-int is asked

-- FTP: wait on both connections during active STOR state
+- lib1500: remove bad check
   
-  When doing PORT and upload (STOR), this function needs to extract the
-  file descriptor for both connections so that it will respond immediately
-  when the server eventually connects back.
+  After curl_multi_wait() returns, this test checked that we got exactly
+  one file descriptor told to read from, but we cannot be sure that is
+  true. curl_multi_wait() will sometimes return earlier without any file
+  descriptor to handle, just just because it is a suitable time to call
+  *perform().
   
-  This flaw caused active connections to become unnecessary slow but they
-  would still often work due to the normal polling on a timeout. The bug
-  also would not occur if the server connected back very fast, like when
-  testing on local networks.
+  This problem showed up with commit 29bf0598.

+- test1230: verify CONNECT to a numerical ipv6-address
 
-  connect: treat an interface bindlocal() problem as a non-fatal error
-  
-  I am using curl_easy_setopt(CURLOPT_INTERFACE, "if!something") to force
-  transfers to use a particular interface but the transfer fails with
-  CURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED, "Failed binding local connection end" if the
-  interface I specify has no IPv6 address. The cause is as follows:
+- sws: support extracting test number from CONNECT ipv6-address!
   
-  The remote hostname resolves successfully and has an IPv6 address and an
-  IPv4 address.
+  If an ipv6-address is provided to CONNECT, the last hexadecimal group in
+  the address will be used as the test number! For example the address
+  "[1234::ff]" would be treated as test case 255.
+
+- curl_multi_wait: only use internal timer if not -1
   
-  cURL attempts to connect to the IPv6 address first.
+  commit 29bf0598aad5 introduced a problem when the "internal" timeout is
+  prefered to the given if shorter, as it didn't consider the case where
+  -1 was returned. Now the internal timeout is only considered if not -1.
   
-  bindlocal (in lib/connect.c) fails because Curl_if2ip cannot find an
-  IPv6 address on the interface.

+  example file and a new Windows character device name with
+  a colon as examples of other characters that are special
+  and potentially dangerous (this reverts and reworks commit

+
+Daniel Stenberg (3 Jun 2013)
+- curl_multi_wait: reduce timeout if the multi handle wants to
   
-  This change will make cURL try the next IP address in the list.
+  If the multi handle's pending timeout is less than what is passed into
+  this function, it will now opt to use the shorter time anyway since it
+  is a very good hint that the handle wants to process something in a
+  shorter time than what otherwise would happen.
   
-  Also included are two changes related to IPv6 address scope:
+  curl_multi_wait.3 was updated accordingly to clarify
   
-  - Filter the choice of address in Curl_if2ip to only consider addresses
-  with the same scope ID as the connection address (mismatched scope for
-  local and remote address does not result in a working connection).
+  This is the reason for bug #1224
   
-  - bindlocal was ignoring the scope ID of addresses returned by
-  Curl_if2ip . Now it uses them.

-- util.c: Made write_pidfile write the correct PID on MinGW/Msys
+  We found that in specific cases if the connection is abruptly closed,
+  the underlying socket is listed in a close_wait state. We continue to
+  call the curl_multi_perform, curl_mutli_fdset etc. None of these APIs
+  report the socket closed / connection finished.  Since we have cases
+  where the multi connection is only used once, this can pose a problem
+  for us. I've read that if another connection was to come in, curl would
+  see the socket as bad and attempt to close it at that time -
+  unfortunately, this does not work for us.
   
-  This workaround fixes an issue on MinGW/Msys regarding the Perl
-  testsuite scripts not being able to signal or control the server
-  processes. The MinGW Perl runtime only sees the Msys processes and
-  their corresponding PIDs, but sockfilt (and other servers) wrote the
-  Windows PID into their PID-files. Since this PID is useless to the
-  testsuite, the write_pidfile function was changed to search for the
-  Msys PID and write that into the PID-file.

-- WIN32 MemoryTracking: track wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() usage
-  
-  As of 25-mar-2013 wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() are only used in
-  WIN32 specific code, so tracking of these has not been extended for
-  other build targets. Without this fix, memory tracking system on
-  WIN32 builds, when using these functions, would provide misleading
-  results.
-  
-  In order to properly extend this support for all targets curl.h
-  would have to define curl_wcsdup_callback prototype and consequently
-  wchar_t should be visible before that in curl.h.  IOW curl_wchar_t
-  defined in curlbuild.h and this pulling whatever system header is
-  required to get wchar_t definition.
-  
-  Additionally a new curl_global_init_mem() function that also receives
-  user defined wcsdup() callback would be required.

-- HTTP proxy: insert slash in URL if missing
-  
-  curl has been accepting URLs using slightly wrong syntax for a long
-  time, such as when completely missing as slash "http://example.org" or
-  missing a slash when a query part is given
-  "http://example.org?q=foobar".
-  
-  curl would translate these into a legitimate HTTP request to servers,
-  although as was shown in bug #1206 it was not adjusted properly in the
-  cases where a HTTP proxy was used.
-  
-  Test 1213 and 1214 were added to the test suite to verify this fix.
+- tests: Added SMTP AUTH with initial response tests
+
+- tests: Updated SMTP tests to decouple client initial response
   
-  The test HTTP server was adjusted to allow us to specify test number in
-  the host name only without using any slashes in a given URL.
+  Updated test903 and test904 following the addition of CURLOPT_SASL_IR
+  as the default behaviour of SMTP AUTH responses is now to not include
+  the initial response. New tests with --sasl-ir support to follow.
+
+- imap: Added support for overriding the SASL initial response
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1206
-  Reported by: ScottJi
+  In addition to checking for the SASL-IR capability the user can override
+  the sending of the client's initial response in the AUTHENTICATION
+  command with the use of CURLOPT_SASL_IR should the server erroneously
+  not report SASL-IR when it does support it.

-- Multiple pipelines and limiting the number of connections.
+Daniel Stenberg (26 Apr 2013)
+- curl_easy_init: use less mallocs
   
-  Introducing a number of options to the multi interface that
-  allows for multiple pipelines to the same host, in order to
-  optimize the balance between the penalty for opening new
-  connections and the potential pipelining latency.
+  By introducing an internal alternative to curl_multi_init() that accepts
+  parameters to set the hash sizes, easy handles will now use tiny socket
+  and connection hash tables since it will only ever add a single easy
+  handle to that multi handle.
   
-  Two new options for limiting the number of connections:
+  This decreased the number mallocs in test 40 (which is a rather simple
+  and typical easy interface use case) from 1142 to 138. The maximum
+  amount of memory allocated used went down from 118969 to 78805.

+
+Daniel Stenberg (26 Apr 2013)
+- ftp_state_pasv_resp: connect through proxy also when set by env
   
-  CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of running connections
-  to the same host. When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
-  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
-  finished, so we can reuse the connection.
+  When connecting back to an FTP server after having sent PASV/EPSV,
+  libcurl sometimes didn't use the proxy properly even though the proxy
+  was used for the initial connect.
   
-  CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of connections in total.
-  When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
-  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
-  finished. The free connection will then be reused, if possible, or
-  closed if the pending handle can't reuse it.
+  The function wrongly checked for the CURLOPT_PROXY variable to be set,
+  which made it act wrongly if the proxy information was set with an
+  environment variable.
   
-  Several new options for pipelining:
+  Added test case 711 to verify (based on 707 which uses --socks5). Also
+  added test712 to verify another variation of setting the proxy: with
+  --proxy socks5://
   
-  CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH - Limits the pipeling length. If a
-  pipeline is "full" when a connection is to be reused, a new connection
-  will be opened if the CURLMOPT_MAX_xxx_CONNECTIONS limits allow it.
-  If not, the handle will be put in a pending state until a connection is
-  ready (either free or a pipe got shorter).

-  imap: Added custom request perform and response handler functions
+  proxy: make ConnectionExists() check credential of proxyconnections too
   
-  Added imap_custom(), which initiates the custom command processing,
-  and an associated response handler imap_state_custom_resp(), which
-  handles any responses by sending them to the client as body data.
+  Previously it only compared credentials if the requested needle
+  connection wasn't using a proxy. This caused NTLM authentication
+  failures when using proxies as the authentication code wasn't send on
+  the connection where the challenge arrived.
   
-  All untagged responses with the same name as the first word of the
-  custom request string are accepted, with the exception of SELECT and
-  EXAMINE which have responses that cannot be easily identified. An
-  extra check has been provided for them so that any untagged responses
-  are accepted for them.

-  imap: Enabled APPEND support in imap_perform()
+  connect: treat an interface bindlocal() problem as a non-fatal error
   
-  Added logic in imap_perform() to perform an APPEND rather than SELECT
-  and FETCH if an upload has been specified.
-
-- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
-
-  imap: Implemented APPEND final processing
+  I am using curl_easy_setopt(CURLOPT_INTERFACE, "if!something") to force
+  transfers to use a particular interface but the transfer fails with
+  CURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED, "Failed binding local connection end" if the
+  interface I specify has no IPv6 address. The cause is as follows:
   
-  The APPEND operation needs to be performed in several steps:
-    1) We send "<tag> APPEND <mailbox> <flags> {<size>}\r\n"
-    2) Server responds with continuation respose "+ ...\r\n"
-    3) We start the transfer and send <size> bytes of data
-    4) Only now we end the request command line by sending "\r\n"
-    5) Server responds with "<tag> OK ...\r\n"
+  The remote hostname resolves successfully and has an IPv6 address and an
+  IPv4 address.
   
-  This commit performs steps 4 and 5, in the DONE phase, as more
-  processing is required after the transfer.
+  cURL attempts to connect to the IPv6 address first.
+  
+  bindlocal (in lib/connect.c) fails because Curl_if2ip cannot find an
+  IPv6 address on the interface.
+  
+  This is a fatal error in singleipconnect()
+  
+  This change will make cURL try the next IP address in the list.
+  
+  Also included are two changes related to IPv6 address scope:
+  
+  - Filter the choice of address in Curl_if2ip to only consider addresses
+  with the same scope ID as the connection address (mismatched scope for
+  local and remote address does not result in a working connection).
+  
+  - bindlocal was ignoring the scope ID of addresses returned by
+  Curl_if2ip . Now it uses them.

+  This workaround fixes an issue on MinGW/Msys regarding the Perl

-- imap: Changed the order of the response types in imap_endofresp()
+Steve Holme (18 Mar 2013)
+- TODO: Reordered the protocol and security sections
   
-  From a maintenance point of view the code reads better to view tagged
-  responses, then untagged followed by continuation responses.
+  Moved SMTP, POP3, IMAP and New Protocol sections to be listed after the
+  other protocols (FTP, HTTP and TELNET) and SASL to be after SSL and
+  GnuTLS as these are all security related.
   
-  Additionally, this matches the order of responses in POP3.
+  Additionally fixed numbering of the SSL and GnuTLS sections as they
+  weren't consecutive.

-- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
-
-  imap: Added the ability to FETCH a specific UID and SECTION
+  curl has been accepting URLs using slightly wrong syntax for a long
+  time, such as when completely missing as slash "http://example.org" or
+  missing a slash when a query part is given
+  "http://example.org?q=foobar".
   
-  Updated the FETCH command to send the UID and SECTION parsed from the
-  URL. By default the BODY specifier doesn't include a section, BODY[] is
-  now sent whereas BODY[TEXT] was previously sent. In my opinion
-  retrieving just the message text is rarely useful when dealing with
-  emails, as the headers are required for example, so that functionality
-  is not retained. In can however be simulated by adding SECTION=TEXT to
-  the URL.
+  curl would translate these into a legitimate HTTP request to servers,
+  although as was shown in bug #1206 it was not adjusted properly in the
+  cases where a HTTP proxy was used.

-Steve Holme (23 Feb 2013)
-- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
+  Introducing a number of options to the multi interface that
+  allows for multiple pipelines to the same host, in order to
+  optimize the balance between the penalty for opening new
+  connections and the potential pipelining latency.
+  
+  Two new options for limiting the number of connections:
+  
+  CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of running connections
+  to the same host. When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
+  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
+  finished, so we can reuse the connection.
+  
+  CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of connections in total.
+  When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
+  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
+  finished. The free connection will then be reused, if possible, or
+  closed if the pending handle can't reuse it.
+  
+  Several new options for pipelining:
+  
+  CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH - Limits the pipeling length. If a
+  pipeline is "full" when a connection is to be reused, a new connection
+  will be opened if the CURLMOPT_MAX_xxx_CONNECTIONS limits allow it.
+  If not, the handle will be put in a pending state until a connection is
+  ready (either free or a pipe got shorter).
+  
+  CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - A pipelined connection will not
+  be reused if it is currently processing a transfer with a content
+  length that is larger than this.
+  
+  CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - A pipelined connection will not
+  be reused if it is currently processing a chunk larger than this.
+  
+  CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL - A blacklist of hosts that don't allow
+  pipelining.
+  
+  CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL - A blacklist of server types that don't allow
+  pipelining.
+  
+  See the curl_multi_setopt() man page for details.

+  An extern submits a psect and a global reference to the linker to point

-- install-sh: updated to support multiple source files as arguments
-  
-  Version 7.29.0 uses Makefiles generated with a newer version of the
-  autotools than the previous 7.28.1. These Makefiles try to install
-  e.g. header files by calling install-sh with multiple source files as
-  arguments. The bundled install-sh is to old and does not support this.
-  
-  The problem only occurs, if install-sh is actually being used, ie. the
-  platform install executable is to old or not usable. Example: Solaris
-  10.
+  imap: Fixed ftpserver.pl to allow verification even through LIST command

-- email: Post optimisation of endofresp() tidy up
+- imap: Added check for empty UID in FETCH command
   
-  Removed unnecessary end of line check and return.

-- darwinssl: Fix send glitchiness with data > 32 or so KB
-  
-  An ambiguity in the SSLWrite() documentation lead to a bad inference in the
-  code where we assumed SSLWrite() returned the amount of bytes written to
-  the socket, when that is not actually true; it returns the amount of data
-  that is buffered for writing to the socket if it returns errSSLWouldBlock.

-  Fixed the SASL capability detection to include the space character
-  before the authentication mechanism list. Otherwise a capability such
-  as SASLSOMETHING would be interpreted as enabling SASL and potentially
-  trying to identify SOMETHING as a mechanism.
+  All untagged responses with the same name as the first word of the

-- DONE: consider callback-aborted transfers premature
+  imap: Enabled APPEND support in imap_perform()
   
-  This bug report properly identified that when doing SMTP and aborting
-  the transfer with a callback, it must be considered aborted prematurely
-  by the code to avoid QUIT etc to be attempted as that would cause a
-  hang.
+  Added logic in imap_perform() to perform an APPEND rather than SELECT
+  and FETCH if an upload has been specified.
+
+- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
+
+  imap: Implemented APPEND final processing
   
-  The new test case 1507 verifies this behavior.
+  The APPEND operation needs to be performed in several steps:
+    1) We send "<tag> APPEND <mailbox> <flags> {<size>}\r\n"
+    2) Server responds with continuation respose "+ ...\r\n"
+    3) We start the transfer and send <size> bytes of data
+    4) Only now we end the request command line by sending "\r\n"
+    5) Server responds with "<tag> OK ...\r\n"
   
-  Reported by: Patricia Muscalu
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1184
+  This commit performs steps 4 and 5, in the DONE phase, as more
+  processing is required after the transfer.

-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message: fix buffer overflow
-  
-  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
-  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
-  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.
+  imap: Introduced FETCH_FINAL state for processing final fetch responses
   
-  This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a
-  server that a libcurl based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or
-  IMAP. For applications that accept user provided URLs, it is also
-  thinkable that a malicious user would feed an application with a URL to
-  a server hosting code targetting this flaw.

-  VMS: fix and generate the VMS build config
-  
-  config_h.com is a new file that generates a config.h file based on the
-  curl_config.h.in file and a quick scan of the configure script.  This is
-  actually a generic procedure that is shared with other VMS packages.
-  
-  The existing pre-built config-vms.h had over 100 entries that were not
-  correct and in some cases conflicted with the build options available in
-  the build_vms.com.
-  
-  generate_config_vms_h_curl.com is a helper procedure to the
-  config_h.com.  It covers the cases that the generic config_h.com is not
-  able to figure out, and accepts input from the build_vms.com procedure.
-  
-  build_curlbuild_h.com is a new file to generate the curlbuild.h file
-  that Curl is now using when it is using a curl_config.h file.
-  
-  post-config-vms.h is a new file that is needed to provide VMS specific
-  definitions, and most of them need to be set before the system header
-  files are included.
-  
-  The VMS build procedure is fixed:
-  
-     1. Fixed to link in the correct HP ssl library.
-     2. Fixed to detect if HP Kerberos is installed.
-     3. Fixed to detect if HP LDAP is installed.
-     4. Fixed to detect if gnv$libzshr is installed.
-     5. Simplified the input parameter parsing to not use a loop.
-     6. Warn that 64 bit pointer option support is not complete
-        in comments.
-     7. Default to IEEE floating if platform supports it so
-        resulting libcurl will be compatible with other
-        open source projects on VMS.
-     8. Default to LARGEFILE if platform supports it.
-     9. Default to enable SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, libz
-        if the libraries are present.
-     10. Build with exact case global symbols for libcurl.
-     11. Generate linker option file needed.
-     12. Compiler list option only commonly needed items.
-     13. fulllist option for those who really want it.
-     14. Create debug symbol file on Alpha, IA64.

-  
-  The flag may improve the SSL-connection shutdown in case of an

-- xc-cc-check.m4: re-evaluate exporting and AC_SUBST'ing vars
-  
-  Notes:
-  
-  When running a configure script that has nested packages (for example
-  libcurl's configure with --enable-ares and c-ares sources embedded in
-  curl tree) and AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([nested-subdir]) machinery is used to
-  automatically run the nested configure script from within the parent
-  configure script, it happens that the nested _shell_ script will
-  inherit shell variables exported from the parent _shell_ script.
-  
-  If for example parent configure script sets and exports LDFLAGS and LIBS
-  variables with proper values in order to link either a parent library or
-  program with a library which will be configured and built by a nested
-  package; It will happen that when the nested configure script runs, the
-  nested library does not exist yet and _any_ link-test done in the nested
-  configure will fail, such as those that autoconf macros perform in order
-  to detect existing compiler and its characteristics, the result is that
-  the nested configure script will fail with errors such as:
-  
-  configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
-  
-  For now, we no longer export variables previously exported here.
+- smtp: Removed some FTP heritage leftovers
   
-  On the other hand, AC_SUBST'ing them is appropriate and even with nested
-  packages each package's config.status gets its own package values.
+  Removed user and passwd from the SMTP struct as these cannot be set on
+  a per-request basis and are leftover from legacy FTP code.
   
-  So we reinstate AC_SUBST'ing previously AC_SUBST'ed variables.

-  NSS caches certs/keys returned by the SSL_GetClientAuthDataHook callback
-  and if we connect second time to the same server, the cached cert/key
-  pair is used.  If we use multiple client certificates for different
-  paths on the same server, we need to clear the session cache to force
-  NSS to call the hook again.  The commit 052a08ff prevented the session
-  cache from being cleared if a client certificate from file was used.
-  
-  The condition is now fixed to cover both cases: consssl->client_nickname
-  is not NULL if a client certificate from the NSS database is used and
-  connssl->obj_clicert is not NULL if a client certificate from file is
-  used.

-- build: fix circular header inclusion with other packages
-  
-  This commit renames lib/setup.h to lib/curl_setup.h and
-  renames lib/setup_once.h to lib/curl_setup_once.h.
-  
-  Removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard foreign
-  to libcurl. [1]
-  
-  Removes the need and presence of an alarming notice we carried
-  in old setup_once.h [2]
-  
-  ----------------------------------------
-  
-  1 - lib/setup_once.h used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro as header inclusion guard
-      up to commit ec691ca3 which changed this to HEADER_CURL_SETUP_ONCE_H,
-      this single inclusion guard is enough to ensure that inclusion of
-      lib/setup_once.h done from lib/setup.h is only done once.
-  
-      Additionally lib/setup.h has always used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro to
-      protect inclusion of setup_once.h even after commit ec691ca3, this
-      was to avoid a circular header inclusion triggered when building a
-      c-ares enabled version with c-ares sources available which also has
-      a setup_once.h header. Commit ec691ca3 exposes the real nature of
-      __SETUP_ONCE_H usage in lib/setup.h, it is a header inclusion guard
-      foreign to libcurl belonging to c-ares's setup_once.h
-  
-      The renaming this commit does, fixes the circular header inclusion,
-      and as such removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard
-      foreign to libcurl. Macro __SETUP_ONCE_H no longer used in libcurl.
-  
-  2 - Due to the circular interdependency of old lib/setup_once.h and the
-      c-ares setup_once.h header, old file lib/setup_once.h has carried
-      back from 2006 up to now days an alarming and prominent notice about
-      the need of keeping libcurl's and c-ares's setup_once.h in sync.
-  
-      Given that this commit fixes the circular interdependency, the need
-      and presence of mentioned notice is removed.
+  libcurl documentation: updates HTML index
   
-      All mentioned interdependencies come back from now old days when
-      the c-ares project lived inside a curl subdirectory. This commit
-      removes last traces of such fact.
+  * Adds several links to documentation of library functions which were
+    missing.
+  * Marks documentation of deprecated library functions "(deprecated)".
+  * Removes spurious .html suffixes.

+  Use Curl_pp_moredata() in Curl_pp_multi_statemach() to check if there is

-- configure: update req to 2.59
+  pingpong: Introduce Curl_pp_moredata()
   
-  I ran the 2.59 version of autoupdate that updates obsoleted configure.ac
-  constructs to the 2.59 standard. With a little hands-on fiddling I
-  prevented it from ruining the quoting in AS_HELP_STRING() uses.
+  A simple function to test whether the PP is not sending and there are
+  still more data in its receiver cache. This will be later utilized to:
   
-  I subsequently also bumped the required autoconf version to 2.59
-  (released in December 2003) as I don't have an older autoconf version
-  around to test with and I can't be bothered to install one either...
+  1) Change Curl_pp_multi_statemach() and Curl_pp_easy_statemach() to
+     not test socket state and just call user's statemach_act() function
+     when there are more data to process, because otherwise the task would
+     just hang, waiting for more data from the socket.

-- mk-ca-bundle: add -f, support passing to stdout and more
-  
-  1. When the downloaded data file from Mozilla is current, but the output
-  bundle does not exist: continue processing to create the bundle.  The
-  goal is to have the output file - not just download the latest input.
-  
-  2. added -f option to force re-processing the file.  Useful for
-  debugging/testing the process.
-  
-  3. added support for output to '-' (stdout), allowing the output to be
-  piped.
-  
-  4. All progress and error messages go to STDERR rather than STDOUT (3)
-  
-  5. The script opened and closed the output file many times
-  unnecessarily.  It now opens it once, does the output and closes it.
-  
-  6. Backup of the input files happens after successful processing, not
-  before.
-  
-  7. The output is written to a temporary file, and renamed to the
-  requested name after backup - this greatly reduces the window where the
-  file can be seen partially written.

-- build and tests: curl_10char_object_name() shell function
-  
-  lib/objnames.inc provides definition of curl_10char_object_name() shell
-  function. The intended purpose of this function is to transliterate a
-  (*.c) source file name that may be longer than 10 characters, or not,
-  into a string with at most 10 characters which may be used as an OS/400
-  object name.
-  
-  Test case 1221 does unit testng of this function and also verifies
-  that it is possible to generate distinct short object names for all
-  curl and libcurl *.c source file names.
-  
-  lib/objnames-test.sh is the shell script used for test case 1221.
-  
-  tests/runtests.pl modified to accept shell script test cases.

-  Applied the same debug message as used in smtp_doing() and imap_doing()
-  when pop3_multi_statemach() fails.
+  ... since they're not used by the easy interface really, I wanted to
+  remove the association. Also, I unified the pingpong statemachine driver
+  into a single function with a 'wait' argument: Curl_pp_statemach.
 
-- imap_doing: don't call imap_dophase_done() if already failed

-  76 private header files renamed to use our standard naming scheme.

+  e.g. header files by calling install-sh with multiple source files as

+  The problem only occurs, if install-sh is actually being used, ie. the

+  10.
   
-  When prefixing a path with /~/ it is supposed to be used relative to the
-  user's home directory but it didn't work. Now we cut off the entire

+  The files install-sh and mkinstalldirs are now updated with the automake

+- darwinssl: Fix send glitchiness with data > 32 or so KB
   
-  Issue: When building a 32bit target with large file support HP-UX
-  <sys/socket.h> header file may simultaneously provide two different
-  sets of declarations for sendfile and sendpath functions, one with
-  static and another with external linkage. Given that we do not use
-  mentioned functions we really don't care which linkage is the
-  appropriate one, but on the other hand, the double declaration emmits
-  warnings when using the HP-UX compiler and errors when using modern
-  gcc versions resulting in fatal compilation errors.
+  An ambiguity in the SSLWrite() documentation lead to a bad inference in the
+  code where we assumed SSLWrite() returned the amount of bytes written to
+  the socket, when that is not actually true; it returns the amount of data
+  that is buffered for writing to the socket if it returns errSSLWouldBlock.
+  Now darwinssl_send() returns CURLE_AGAIN if data is buffered but not written.

+- smtp: Added support for the STARTTLS capability (Part Two)
   
-  When cross-compiling, CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG was checking for the cross
-  pkg-config using ${host}-pkg-config.
+  Added honoring of the tls_supported flag when starting a TLS upgrade
+  rather than unconditionally attempting it. If the use_ssl flag is set

+
+- pop3: Added support for the STLS capability (Part Three)
   
-  The gold standard for doing this correctly is pkg-config's own macro,
-  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG.  However, on the assumption that you have a good
-  reason not to use that directly (reduced dependencies for maintainer
-  builds?), the behaviour of cURL's version should at least match.
-  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG uses AC_PATH_TOOL, which ultimately ends up trying
-  ${host_alias}-pkg-config; this is not quite the same as what cURL does,
-  and may differ because ${host} has been run through config.sub.  For
-  instance, when cross-building to the armhf architecture on Ubuntu,
-  ${host_alias} is arm-linux-gnueabihf while ${host} is
-  arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.  This may also have been the cause of the
-  problem reported at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0224.html.

+
+- imap: Added support for the STARTTLS capability (Part Three)
   
-  AC_PATH_TOOL is significantly simpler than cURL's current code, and
-  dates back to well before the current minimum of Autoconf 2.57, so let's
-  use it instead.

-  Introducing a new persistent connection caching system using "bundles".
-  
-  A bundle is a list of all persistent connections to the same host.
-  The connection cache consists of a hash of bundles, with the
-  hostname as the key.
-  The benefits may not be obvious, but they are two:
-  
-  1) Faster search for connections to reuse, since the hash
-     lookup only finds connections to the host in question.
-  2) It lays out the groundworks for an upcoming patch,
-     which will introduce multiple HTTP pipelines.

   1.4 When will you make curl do XXXX ?
 
   We love suggestions of what to change in order to make curl and libcurl
   better. We do however believe in a few rules when it comes to the future of
   curl:
 
-  * Curl -- the command line tool -- is to remain a non-graphical command line
-    tool. If you want GUIs or fancy scripting capabilities, you should look
-    for another tool that uses libcurl.
-
-  * We do not add things to curl that other small and available tools already
-    do very fine at the side. Curl's output is fine to pipe into another
-    program or redirect to another file for the next program to interpret.
-
-  * We focus on protocol related issues and improvements. If you wanna do more
-    magic with the supported protocols than curl currently does, chances are
-    big we will agree. If you wanna add more protocols, we may very well
-    agree.
-
-  * If you want someone else to make all the work while you wait for us to
-    implement it for you, that is not a very friendly attitude. We spend a
-    considerable time already on maintaining and developing curl. In order to
-    get more out of us, you should consider trading in some of your time and
-    efforts in return.

   3.16 What certificates do I need when I use SSL?
 
   There are three different kinds of "certificates" to keep track of when we
   talk about using SSL-based protocols (HTTPS or FTPS) using curl or libcurl.
 
-  - Client certificate. The server you communicate may require that you can
-    provide this in order to prove that you actually are who you claim to be.
-    If the server doesn't require this, you don't need a client certificate.
-
-    A client certificate is always used together with a private key, and the
-    private key has a pass phrase that protects it.
-
-  - Server certificate. The server you communicate with has a server
-    certificate. You can and should verify this certificate to make sure that
-    you are truly talking to the real server and not a server impersonating
-    it.
-
-  - Certificate Authority certificate ("CA cert"). You often have several CA
-    certs in a CA cert bundle that can be used to verify a server certificate
-    that was signed by one of the authorities in the bundle. curl does not
-    come with a CA cert bundle but most curl installs provide one. You can
-    also override the default.
-
-    The server certificate verification process is made by using a Certificate
-    Authority certificate ("CA cert") that was used to sign the server
-    certificate. Server certificate verification is enabled by default in curl
-    and libcurl and is often the reason for problems as explained in FAQ entry
-    4.12 and the SSLCERTS document
-    (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html). Server certificates that are
-    "self-signed" or otherwise signed by a CA that you do not have a CA cert
-    for, cannot be verified. If the verification during a connect fails, you
-    are refused access. You then need to explicitly disable the verification
-    to connect to the server.

+To actually transfer data you have the option of using the "easy" interface,

 The easy interface is a synchronous interface with which you call
 \fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP and let it perform the transfer. When it is
 completed, the function returns and you can continue. More details are found in
 the \fIlibcurl-easy(3)\fP man page.
 
 The multi interface on the other hand is an asynchronous interface, that you
 call and that performs only a little piece of the transfer on each invoke. It
 is perfect if you want to do things while the transfer is in progress, or
 similar. The multi interface allows you to select() on libcurl action, and

 You can have multiple easy handles share certain data, even if they are used

 .SH "GLOBAL CONSTANTS"
 There are a variety of constants that libcurl uses, mainly through its
 internal use of other libraries, which are too complicated for the
 library loader to set up.  Therefore, a program must call a library
 function after the program is loaded and running to finish setting up
 the library code.  For example, when libcurl is built for SSL

Options you set with <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt(3)</a> will be used on every repeated use of this handle until you either call the function again and change the option, or you reset them all with <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_reset.html">curl_easy_reset(3)</a>.

When it is completed, the function returns and you can continue. More details are found in the <span Class="emphasis">libcurl-easy(3)</span> man page. 
 <p class="level0">The multi interface on the other hand is an asynchronous interface, that you call and that performs only a little piece of the transfer on each invoke.
