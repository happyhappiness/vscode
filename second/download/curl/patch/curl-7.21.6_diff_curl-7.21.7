+  The CURLFORM_STREAM is documented to only insert a file name (and thus

+  set, it would insert insert rubbish (or possibly crash).
+  
+  This is now fixed to work as documented, and test 554 has been extended
+  to verify this.

+- curl_formget: fix FILE * leak
   
-  libcurl failed to check the correct struct for HTTPS after CONNECT was
-  issued to the proxy, so it didn't do the TLS handshake and subsequently
-  failed the connection. A regression released in 7.21.5 (introduced
-  around commit 8831000bc07de).
+  Properly deal with the fact that the last fread() call most probably is
+  a short read, and when using callbacks in fact all calls can be short
+  reads. No longer consider a file read done until it returns a 0 from the
+  read function.

-  Reported by: Josue Andrade Gomes
+  Reported by: Aaron Orenstein
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-06/0048.html
 
-- curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE clarification
+- curl_formget: treat CURLFORM_STREAM better
   
-  When set to a HTTP 1.0 proxy, that only affects the CONNECT request and
-  not the regular HTTP request.
+  If a piece is set to use a callback to get the data, it should not be
+  treated as data. It unfortunately also requires that curl_easy_perform()
+  or similar has been used as otherwise the callback function hasn't been
+  figured out and curl_formget won't know how to get the content.
 
-- [Gisle Vanem brought this change]
+- curl_formget.3: CURLFORM_STREAM has its drawbacks
+  
+  Due to a design flaw, the CURLFORM_STREAM option doesn't really work
+  with curl_formget until after curl_easy_perform (or similar).
 
-  CURL_DOES_CONVERSIONS: fixes
+- FAQ: binding clarification
   
-  Made it compile and work again after the code move.
+  We don't author the bindings, they are created outside the main project.
 
-- CURL_DOES_CONVERSIONS: cleanup
+Dan Fandrich (11 Jun 2011)
+- Added http as a dependency of test 1308
+
+Daniel Stenberg (12 Jun 2011)
+- test1309: added to the dist
+
+- write: add return code checks when used
   
-  Massively reduce #ifdefs all over (23 #ifdef lines less so far)
-  Moved conversion-specific code to non-ascii.c
+  These were just warnings in test code but it still makes it nicer to not
+  generate them.
 
-Guenter Knauf (19 Apr 2011)
-- Improve MinGW static makefile builds.
+- long/int mess
   
-  It is now possible to use any combination of features without
-  having to 1st add makefile targets to the main makefile. The
-  main makefile now passes the 'mingw32-feat1-feat2' as var CFG,
-  and the ./[lib|src]/Makefile.m32 parses the CFG var to determine
-  the features to be enabled.
+  Typecast when converting to int from long to avoid some compiler warnings
 
-- Enabled MinGW native Windows IDN build.
+Yang Tse (11 Jun 2011)
+- configure: OpenSSL API detection cleanup
 
-- Windows native IDN fixes.
+Dan Fandrich (11 Jun 2011)
+- Fixed test 1309 to pass the torture test
   
-  changed windows.h include to system header;
-  changed obsolete 2nd check for str_w to str_utf8 in order to catch
-  malloc() failure and avoid a free(NULL);
-  changed calls to GetLastError() to void to kill unsused var compiler
-  warnings;
-  moved one call to GetLastError() into else case so that its only
-  called when WideCharToMultiByte() really fails.
+  Removing dynamic allocations also simplifies the test.
 
-- Windows native IDN fixes.
+Daniel Stenberg (10 Jun 2011)
+- splay: add unit tests
   
-  Provide prototype for curl_win32_idn_to_ascii();
-  remove wrong 3rd parameter from curl_win32_idn_to_ascii() call.
+  The test code that was #ifdef'ed in the code was converted into unit
+  tests in test case 1309. I also removed the #if 0'ed code from splay.c
 
-Daniel Stenberg (19 Apr 2011)
-- curl-config: fix version output
+- unittest: mark all unit tested functions
   
-  do the s/VERSION/CURLVERSION replacement for the human redable output
-  for --checkfor
+  With "@unittest: [num]" in the header comment for each tested function.
+  Shows we have a log way to go still...
+
+- CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER: clarify the docs
+
+- unit test formpost: added test case 1308
   
-  Reported by: Ryan Schmidt
+  This is a few first rather basic tests of curl_formadd() and
+  curl_formget(). Should serve as building blocks to add more variations
+  to the test.

-  The new libcurl and command line options are now described.
+  When closing a connection, the speedchecker's timestamp is now deleted
+  so that it cannot accidentally be used by a fresh connection on the same
+  handle when examining the transfer speed.
+  
+  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/679709
 
-- transfer-encoding: added new option and cmdline
+Yang Tse (7 Jun 2011)
+- urldata: use uniform inclusion style for OpenSSL headers
+
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Jun 2011)
+- HTTP time condition: force closure for 200 OK
   
-  Added CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING as the option to set to request Transfer
-  Encoding in HTTP requests (if built zlib enabled). I also renamed
-  CURLOPT_ENCODING to CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING (while keeping the old name
-  around) to reduce the confusion when we have to encoding options for
-  HTTP.
+  When a time condition isn't met, so that no body is delivered to the
+  application even though a 2xx response is being read from the server, we
+  must close the connection to avoid a re-use of the connection to be
+  completely tricked.
   
-  --tr-encoding is now the new command line option for curl to request
-  this, and thus I updated the test cases accordingly.
+  Added test 1128 to verify.
 
-- CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING: now used for transfer encoding too
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with b772f3a32146d7d
 
-- TE: do the Connection: header
+Yang Tse (6 Jun 2011)
+- configure: get API info for a couple of OpenSSL functions
+
+Daniel Stenberg (5 Jun 2011)
+- wait_ms: takes an int argument
   
-  When TE: is inserted in the request, we must add a "Connection: TE" as
-  well to be HTTP 1.1 compliant. If a custom Connection: header is passed
-  in, we must use that and only append TE to it. Test case 1125 verifies
-  TE: + custom Connection:.
+  Typecasts added since I changed more code to use long for timeouts
 
-- test1124: verify gzip AND chunked transfer-encoding
+- Curl_socket_ready: make timeout a 'long'
+  
+  It was mostly typecasted to int all over the code so switching to long
+  instead all over should be a net gain.
 
-- TE: rename struct field content_encoding
+Yang Tse (4 Jun 2011)
+- xlc: avoid preprocessor definition usage when linking
+
+- unit tests: disable unit tests for a given cross-compilation configuration.
   
-  Since this struct member is used in the code to determine what and how
-  to decode automatically and since it is now also used for compressed
-  Transfer-Encodings, I renamed it to the more suitable 'auto_decoding'
+  cross-compilation of unit tests static library/programs fails when
+  libcurl shared library is also built. This might be due to a libtool or
+  automake issue. In this case we disable unit tests.
 
-- HTTP: add support for gzip and deflate Transfer-Encoding
+Daniel Stenberg (3 Jun 2011)
+- cookie_output: made private
+
+- digest_cleanup_one: made private
+
+- privatise: make private functions static
+
+- Curl_fileinfo_dup: removed, not used
+
+- parsedate: turn private and static
   
-  Transfer-Encoding differs from Content-Encoding in a few subtle ways,
-  but primarily it concerns the transfer only and not the content so when
-  discovered to be compressed we know we have to uncompress it. There will
-  only arrive compressed transfers in a response after we have requested
-  them with the appropriate TE: header.
+  I removed the prefix as well accordingly.
+
+Dan Fandrich (2 Jun 2011)
+- curl hasn't sent a Pragma: header by default for a while
+
+Yang Tse (2 Jun 2011)
+- unit tests: attempt to fix linkage issue

-  separately defined to be removed in a very distant future). This error
-  code is meant to be used to return when an option is given to libcurl

-- rtsp: move protocol code to dedicated file
+- checksrc: add -W to allow a file to be whitelisted
   
-  The RTSP-specific function for checking for "dead" connection is better
-  located in rtsp.c. The code using this is now written without #ifdefs as
-  the function call is instead turned into a macro (in rtsp.h) when RTSP
-  is disabled.
+  Useful when a known file just doesn't comply and there's no intention to
+  make it do so.
 
-- MAIL-ETIQUETTE: intro and spam
+- whitespace cleanup: no space first in conditionals
   
-  Added a little generic info section about the lists and a section about

+  "if(a)" is our style, not "if( a )"
 
-- TODO-RELEASE: 1 fixed, 1 notabug
+- lib/make: run checksrc.pl once for all files
   
-  Fixed:
+  Since it now supports multiple files this will be faster and will show
+  problems for more file than one at a time - more convenient.
+
+- checksrc: scan many files, more checks
   
-  271 - fix the IPv6-working probing to only exist at one place in the code and
-        only get done once
+  It now scans multiple files and outputs an error+warning count summary
+  at the end in case at least one was detected.
   
-  A problem not repeatable and no proper recipe given and therefore simply
-  removed for now until we hear something else:
+  -D can be used to specify in which dir the files are located
   
-  282 - 100 Continue responses should return the "final" HTTP response code:
-        "Getting the HTTP response code following a 100 Continue"
+  The script now scans for conditions that starts with a space for
+  if/while/for lines.
 
-- ipv6: only probe once
+- Makefile: run checksrc if debug enabled
   
-  Move ipv6-functional-probe into a single function that is used from all
-  places that need to know.
-  
-  Make the probe function store the result in a static variable so that
-  subsequent invokes just returns the previous result and won't have to
-  probe again.
+  And make the build fail if a warning or error was detected
 
-- headers: more copyright headers added
+- checksrc: exit error code if warnings or errors
 
-- MAIL-ETIQUETTE: how to behave
-  
-  This is a new documentation for the source tree. This information has
-  been present since a long time at
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/etiquette.html but now it is put into a plain

-  Signed-off-by: Dave Reisner <d@falconindy.com>
+  The internal resolver API is defined in asyn.h for asynch resolvers.
 
-- retry-request: rewind if data was sent
+- asynch resolvers: cleanup
   
-  When libcurl sends a HTTP request on a re-used connection and detects it
-  being closed (ie no data at all was read from it), it is important to
-  rewind if any data in the request was sent using the read callback or
-  was read from file, as otherwise the retried request will be broken.
+  Fixed indents, coding conventions and white space edits.

-- nss: do not ignore value of CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER
-  
-  When NSS-powered libcurl connected to a SSL server with
-  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to zero, NSS remembered that the peer
-  certificate was accepted by libcurl and did not ask the second time when
-  connecting to the same server with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to one.
+- SFTP: close file before postquote
   
-  This patch turns off the SSL session cache for the particular SSL socket
-  if peer verification is disabled.  In order to avoid any performance
-  impact, the peer verification is completely skipped in that case, which
-  makes it even faster than before.
+  Make sure that files are closed before the post quote commands run as if
+  they operate on the just transferred file they could otherwise easily
+  fail.

+- Curl_http_connect: detect HTTPS properly after CONNECT
   
-  As a follow-up to commit 8831000bc0: don't assume that the SSL powered
-  protocol alternatives are available.
-
-- ldap: use the new protocol handler setup
+  libcurl failed to check the correct struct for HTTPS after CONNECT was
+  issued to the proxy, so it didn't do the TLS handshake and subsequently
+  failed the connection. A regression released in 7.21.5 (introduced
+  around commit 8831000bc07de).

+  When set to a HTTP 1.0 proxy, that only affects the CONNECT request and
+  not the regular HTTP request.
 
-- protocols: use CURLPROTO_ internally
-  
-  The PROT_* set of internal defines for the protocols is no longer
-  used. We now use the same bits internally as we have defined in the
-  public header using the CURLPROTO_ prefix. This is for simplicity and
-  because the PROT_* prefix was already used duplicated internally for a
-  set of KRB4 values.
-  
-  The PROTOPT_* defines were moved up to just below the struct definition
-  within which they are used.

-- protocol handler: added flags field
+  CURL_DOES_CONVERSIONS: fixes
   
-  The protocol handler struct got a 'flags' field for special information
-  and characteristics of the given protocol.
+  Made it compile and work again after the code move.
+
+- CURL_DOES_CONVERSIONS: cleanup
   
-  This now enables us to move away central protocol information such as
-  CLOSEACTION and DUALCHANNEL from single defines in a central place, out
-  to each protocol's definition. It also made us stop abusing the protocol
-  field for other info than the protocol, and we could start cleaning up
-  other protocol-specific things by adding flags bits to set in the
-  handler struct.
+  Massively reduce #ifdefs all over (23 #ifdef lines less so far)
+  Moved conversion-specific code to non-ascii.c
+
+Guenter Knauf (19 Apr 2011)
+- Improve MinGW static makefile builds.
   
-  The "protocol" field connectdata struct was removed as well and the code
-  now refers directly to the conn->handler->protocol field instead. To
-  make things work properly, the code now always store a conn->given
-  pointer that points out the original handler struct so that the code can
-  learn details from the original protocol even if conn->handler is
-  modified along the way - for example when switching to go over a HTTP
-  proxy.
+  It is now possible to use any combination of features without
+  having to 1st add makefile targets to the main makefile. The
+  main makefile now passes the 'mingw32-feat1-feat2' as var CFG,
+  and the ./[lib|src]/Makefile.m32 parses the CFG var to determine
+  the features to be enabled.

-- SSH: add protocol lock direction
-  
-  Some protocols have to call the underlying functions without regard to

-  or vice versa. This is the case for libssh2 based protocols: SCP and
-  SFTP and we now introduce a define to set those protocols and we make

+- transfer-encoding: added new option and cmdline
   
-  For uploads we want to use the _sending_ function even when the socket
-  turns out readable as the underlying libssh2 sftp send function will
-  deal with both accordingly. This is what the cselect_bits magic is for.
+  Added CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING as the option to set to request Transfer

-  VC: add missing file
+- HTTP: add support for gzip and deflate Transfer-Encoding
   
-  http_negotiate_sspi.c was added to the source tree recently
+  Transfer-Encoding differs from Content-Encoding in a few subtle ways,

+Daniel Stenberg (5 Apr 2011)
+- return code cleanup: build, init and run-time errors
   
-  After a request times out, the connection wasn't properly closed and

-  get to use the previously aborted connection.
-
-- multi: better failed connect treatment
+  Stop the abuse of CURLE_FAILED_INIT as return code for things not being
+  init related by introducing two new return codes:
   
-  When failing to connect the protocol during the CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT
-  state, Curl_done() has to be called with the premature flag set TRUE as
-  for the pingpong protocols this can be important.
+  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION
   
-  When Curl_done() is called with premature == TRUE, it needs to call
-  Curl_disconnect() with its 'dead_connection' argument set to TRUE as
-  well so that any protocol handler's disconnect function won't attempt to
-  use the (control) connection for anything.
+  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN replaces return code 4 that has been obsoleted for
+  several years. It is used for returning error when something is
+  attempted to be used but the feature/option was not enabled or
+  explictitly disabled at build-time. Getting this error mostly means that
+  libcurl needs to be rebuilt.
   
-  This problem caused the pingpong protocols to fail to disconnect when
-  STARTTLS failed.
+  CURLE_FAILED_INIT is now saved and used strictly for init
+  failures. Getting this problem means something went seriously wrong,
+  like a resource shortage or similar.

-  CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED: removed
+- fix: re-use of bound connections
   
-  On second thought, I think CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED should be eliminated. It
-  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
-  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
-  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems
-  appropriate; its error string already includes "passwords" as a possible
-  cause. Having a separate TLS auth error code might also cause people to
-  think that a TLS auth failure means the wrong username or password was
-  entered, when it could also be a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack.
+  When asked to bind the local end of a connection when doing a request,
+  the code will now disqualify other existing connections from re-use even
+  if they are connected to the correct remote host.
+  
+  This will also affect which connections that can be used for pipelining,
+  so that only connections that aren't bound or bound to the same
+  device/port you're asking for will be considered.

-- nss: avoid memory leaks and failure of NSS shutdown
+  When NSS-powered libcurl connected to a SSL server with
+  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to zero, NSS remembered that the peer
+  certificate was accepted by libcurl and did not ask the second time when
+  connecting to the same server with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to one.
   
-  ... in case more than one CA is loaded.
+  This patch turns off the SSL session cache for the particular SSL socket
+  if peer verification is disabled.  In order to avoid any performance
+  impact, the peer verification is completely skipped in that case, which
+  makes it even faster than before.

+  Removed a fixed issue, added five new existing ones and clarified one of

-  Fixed compile using OpenSSL versions < 0.9.4a
+- protocols: use CURLPROTO_ internally
+  
+  The PROT_* set of internal defines for the protocols is no longer
+  used. We now use the same bits internally as we have defined in the
+  public header using the CURLPROTO_ prefix. This is for simplicity and
+  because the PROT_* prefix was already used duplicated internally for a
+  set of KRB4 values.
+  
+  The PROTOPT_* defines were moved up to just below the struct definition
+  within which they are used.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (19 Jan 2011)
-- main: make the tlsauth options always present
+- protocol handler: added flags field
   
-  ... to not make the connection between the tool and the libcurl used
-  tighter than necessary, the tlsauth options are now always present but
-  if the used libcurl doesn't have TLSAUTH support it will return failure.
+  The protocol handler struct got a 'flags' field for special information
+  and characteristics of the given protocol.
   
-  Also, replaced strncmp() with strequal to get case insensitive matching.
+  This now enables us to move away central protocol information such as
+  CLOSEACTION and DUALCHANNEL from single defines in a central place, out
+  to each protocol's definition. It also made us stop abusing the protocol
+  field for other info than the protocol, and we could start cleaning up
+  other protocol-specific things by adding flags bits to set in the
+  handler struct.
+  
+  The "protocol" field connectdata struct was removed as well and the code
+  now refers directly to the conn->handler->protocol field instead. To
+  make things work properly, the code now always store a conn->given
+  pointer that points out the original handler struct so that the code can
+  learn details from the original protocol even if conn->handler is
+  modified along the way - for example when switching to go over a HTTP
+  proxy.

-- TheArtOfHttpScripting: extended

-  Extended the intial HTTP protcol part and added a mention of --trace and
-  --trace-ascii.
+- SSH: add protocol lock direction
   
-  Replaced most URLs in the text to use example.com instead of all the
-  made up strange names.
+  Some protocols have to call the underlying functions without regard to
+  what exact state the socket signals. For example even if the socket says
+  "readable", the send function might need to be called while uploading,
+  or vice versa. This is the case for libssh2 based protocols: SCP and
+  SFTP and we now introduce a define to set those protocols and we make

-- connect: use UDP correctly
+- PROT_CLOSEACTION: added SFTP and SCP
   
-  The idea that the protocol and socktype is part of name resolving in the

-  TCP/STREAM and we make sure that when we want to connect to a UDP
-  service we use the correct UDP/DGRAM set instead. This bug was because
-  the ->protocol field was not always set correctly.
-  
-  This bug was only affecting ipv6-disabled non-cares non-threaded builds.
+  Both SFTP and SCP are protocols that need to shut down stuff properly
+  when the connection is about to get torned down. The primary effect of
+  not doing this shows up as memory leaks (when using SCP or SFTP with the

-- c-ares: fix cancelled resolves
+  When failing to connect the protocol during the CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT
+  state, Curl_done() has to be called with the premature flag set TRUE as
+  for the pingpong protocols this can be important.
   
-  When built IPv6-enabled, we could do Curl_done() with one of the two
-  resolves having returned already, so when ares_cancel() is called the
-  resolve callback ends up doing funny things (sometimes resulting in a
-  segfault) since it would try to actually store the previous resolve even
-  though we're shutting down the resolve.
+  When Curl_done() is called with premature == TRUE, it needs to call
+  Curl_disconnect() with its 'dead_connection' argument set to TRUE as
+  well so that any protocol handler's disconnect function won't attempt to
+  use the (control) connection for anything.
   
-  This bug was introduced in commit 8ab137b2bc9630ce so it hasn't been
-  included in any public release.
+  This problem caused the pingpong protocols to fail to disconnect when
+  STARTTLS failed.

-  "ld: warning: symbol `test' has differing types:" while the AIX compiler
-  downright rejects it.
+- ossl_seed: no more RAND_screen
   
-  2) Test case 1119 that was added after this test is way more complete

-- certcheck: use the custom Host: name for checks
+  SMTP: add brackets for MAIL FROM
   
-  If you use a custom Host: name in a request to a SSL server, libcurl
-  will now use that given name when it verifies the server certificate to
-  be correct rather than using the host name used in the actual URL.
-
-- SNI: simplify the custom host name use
-  
-  The redirect check is already done at the position where the customhost
-  field is assigned so there's no point in doing that a second time.
-
-- host: get the custom Host: name more genericly
-  
-  When given a custom host name in a Host: header, we can use it for
-  several different purposes other than just cookies, so we rename it and
-  use it for SSL SNI etc.

-- SSH: use libssh2_session_handshake()
+  ares: ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   
-  In libssh2 1.2.8, libssh2_session_handshake() replaces
-  libssh2_session_startup() to fix the previous portability problem with
-  the socket type that was too small for win64 and thus easily could cause
-  crashes and more.
-
-- SSH: avoid using the libssh2_ prefix
+  Make the c-ares resolver code ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses when
+  IPv6 is enabled.
   
-  It is a bad idea to use the public prefix used by another library and
-  now we realize that libssh2 introduces a symbol in the upcoming version
-  1.2.8 that conflicts with our static function named libssh2_free.
-
-- formdata: provide error message
+  This is a workaround for the missing ares_getaddrinfo() and is a lot
+  easier to implement.
   
-  When failing to build form post due to an error, the code now does a
-  proper failf(). Previously libcurl would report an error like "failed
-  creating formpost data" when a file wasn't possible to open which was
-  not easy for users to figure out.
+  Note that as long as c-ares returns IPv4 addresses when IPv6 addresses
+  were requested but missing, this will cause a host's IPv4 addresses to
+  occur twice in the DNS cache.
   
-  I also lower cased a function name to be named more curl-style and
-  removed some unnecessary code.
+  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-12/0041.html
 
-- URL-parsing: consider ? a divider
-  
-  The URL parser got a little stricter as it now considers a ? to be a
-  host name divider so that the slightly sloppier URLs work too. The
-  problem that made me do this change was the reported problem with an URL
-  like: www.example.com?email=name@example.com This form of URL is not
-  really a legal URL (due to the missing slash after the host name) but is
-  widely accepted by all major browsers and libcurl also already accepted
-  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
-  
-  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the
-  ?  letter as part of user-name or password when given in the URL, which
-  it used to accept (and is tested in test 191). That letter is however
-  mentioned in RFC3986 to be required to be percent encoded since it is
-  used as a divider.

-  We forgot to release the buffer passed to gss_init_sec_context.
+  ossl_connect_common() now checks whether or not 'struct

-  The previous logic was difficult to read as we were reusing the same

-- LDAP: Use FALSE instead of bool_false when setting bits.close
+- CURLOPT_RESOLVE: added
   
-  bool_false is the internal name used in the setup_once.h definition
-  we fall back to for non-C99 non-stdbool systems, it's not the actual
-  name to use in assignments (we use bool_false, bool_true there to
-  avoid global namespace problems, see comment in setup_once.h).
-  The correct C99 value to use is 'false', but let's use FALSE as
-  used elsewhere when assigning to bits.close. FALSE is set equal
-  to 'false' in setup_once.h when possible.
+  CURLOPT_RESOLVE is a new option that sends along a curl_slist with
+  name:port:address sets that will populate the DNS cache with entries so
+  that request can be "fooled" to use another host than what otherwise
+  would've been used. Previously we've encouraged the use of Host: for
+  that when dealing with HTTP, but this new feature has the added bonus
+  that it allows the name from the URL to be used for TLS SNI and server
+  certificate name checks as well.
   
-  This fixes a build problem on C99 targets.
+  This is a first change. Surely more will follow to make it decent.

-  CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL) is used for ldap queries like
-  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/... You are unable to successfully execute the
-  query. In facts ldap_*_bind is executed directly against the ldap server
-  and proxy is totally ignored. This is true for both openLDAP and
-  Microsoft LDAP API.
-  
-  Step to reproduce the error:
-  Just launch "curl --proxytunnel --proxy 192.168.1.1:8080
-  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/dc=... "
+  Removed the code that was needed for libcurl before 7.19.0 which now is
+  more than two years old.
   
-  This fix adds an invocation to Curl_proxyCONNECT against the provided
-  proxy address and on successful "CONNECT" it tunnels ldap query to the
-  final ldap server through the HTTP proxy. As far as I know Microsoft
-  LDAP APIs don't permit tunnelling in any way so the patch provided is
-  for OpenLDAP only.  The patch has been developed against OpenLDAP 2.4.23
-  and has been tested with Microsoft ISA Server 2006 and works properly
-  with basic, digest and NTLM authentication.

-  
-  Rodric provide an awesome recipe that proved libcurl didn't timeout at
-  the requested time - it instead often timed out at [connect time] +
-  [timeout time] instead of the documented and intended [timeout time]
-  only. This bug was due to the code using the wrong base offset when
-  comparing against "now". I could also take the oppurtinity to simplify
-  the code by properly using of the generic help function for this:
-  Curl_timeleft.

-- Curl_timeleft: avoid returning "no timeout" by mistake
+  LDAP: detect non-binary attributes properly
   
-  As this function uses return code 0 to mean that there is no timeout, it
-  needs to check that it doesn't return a time left value that is exactly
-  zero. It could lead to libcurl doing an extra 1000 ms select() call and
-  thus not timing out as accurately as it should.
+  If the query result has a binary attribute, the binary attribute is
+  base64 encoded. But all following non binary attributes are also base64
+  encoded which is wrong.
   
-  I fell over this bug when working on the bug 3061535 but this fix does

-- multi: fixes for timing out handles
-  
-  Add a timeout check for handles in the state machine so that they will
-  timeout in all states disregarding what actions that may or may not
-  happen.
-  
-  Fixed a bug in socket_action introduced recently when looping over timed
-  out handles: it wouldn't assign the 'data' variable and thus it wouldn't
-  properly take care of handles.
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Oct 2010)
+- SSH: use libssh2_session_handshake()
   
-  In the update_timer function, the code now checks if the timeout has
-  been removed and then it tells the application. Previously it would
-  always let the remaining timeout(s) just linger to expire later on.
+  In libssh2 1.2.8, libssh2_session_handshake() replaces
+  libssh2_session_startup() to fix the previous portability problem with
+  the socket type that was too small for win64 and thus easily could cause
+  crashes and more.
 
-- threaded resolver: no more expire 0 calls
+- SSH: avoid using the libssh2_ prefix
   
-  Curl_expire() set to 0 expires ALL timeouts so it should only be called
-  if we truly and really want to remove all timeouts for the handle.
+  It is a bad idea to use the public prefix used by another library and
+  now we realize that libssh2 introduces a symbol in the upcoming version
+  1.2.8 that conflicts with our static function named libssh2_free.
 
-- resolve_server: simplify code
+- formdata: provide error message
   
-  Make use of the helper function Curl_timeleft() instead of duplicating
-  code.
+  When failing to build form post due to an error, the code now does a
+  proper failf(). Previously libcurl would report an error like "failed
+  creating formpost data" when a file wasn't possible to open which was
+  not easy for users to figure out.
+  
+  I also lower cased a function name to be named more curl-style and
+  removed some unnecessary code.
 
-- multi: make sure the next timeout is used when one expires
+- URL-parsing: consider ? a divider
   
-  Each easy handle has a list of timeouts, so as soon as the main timeout
-  for a handle expires, we must make sure to get the next entry from the
-  list and re-add the handle to the splay tree.
+  The URL parser got a little stricter as it now considers a ? to be a
+  host name divider so that the slightly sloppier URLs work too. The
+  problem that made me do this change was the reported problem with an URL
+  like: www.example.com?email=name@example.com This form of URL is not
+  really a legal URL (due to the missing slash after the host name) but is
+  widely accepted by all major browsers and libcurl also already accepted
+  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
   
-  This was attempted previously but was done poorly in my commit
-  232ad6549a68450.

-Dan Fandrich (30 Aug 2010)
-- Added proxy keyword to allow skipping test in proxyless configs
-
-Daniel Stenberg (29 Aug 2010)
-- multi: set timeouts when transfer begins
+  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the
+  ?  letter as part of user-name or password when given in the URL, which
+  it used to accept (and is tested in test 191). That letter is however
+  mentioned in RFC3986 to be required to be percent encoded since it is
+  used as a divider.
   
-  When a new transfer is about to start we now set the proper timeouts to
-  expire for the multi interface if they are set for the handle. This is a
-  follow-up bugfix to make sure that easy handles timeout properly when
-  the times expire and the multi interface is used. This also improves
-  curl_multi_timeout().

+  Having an open brace without a closing brace caused a segfault.

-- Added mk-ca-bundle.vbs script.
+  Having a closing brace too many caused a silent error to occur, which
+  caused curl to bail out and return an error code but no error message
+  was shown. It does now!
   
-  The script works exactly same as the Perl one except for one thing:
-  when the text descriptions generated with openssl are included then
-  the md5 fingerprints are missing; seems openssl has either a bug or
-  a feature which prints the md5 fingerprint output to stdout instead
-  of writing them to specified file; this script could here do the same
-  as what the Perl scripr does (redirect stdout into file) but this
-  makes the script take up double the time because it needs to launch
-  cmd.exe 140 times (fo each openssl call). So I think for now we just
-  ommit the md5 fingerprints, and see if openssl will be fixed.

-- Trial to fix win32 autobuilds.
+  All error message outputs no longer wrongly get _two_ newlines written
+  after the error message.
   
-  It seems that its time to look at some better ideas for the win32
-  non-configure builds; probably a prebuild target which copies
-  config-win32.h to curl_config.h and appends also then feature
-  defines like USE_ARES.

+- libcurl.m4: mention argument is PREFIX
   
-  I fell over this bug report that mentioned that libcurl could wrongly

-  happen. The mentioned bug report was made by Brad Jorsch but is (oddly
-  enough) filed in Debian's bug tracker for the "wmweather+" tool.
+  The macro provides a --with-libcurl option that expects a PREFIX to be
+  specified and not actually a "directory" in which libcurl will be found.
+  This now spells that out more clearly.

-- multi: use timeouts properly for MAX_RECV/SEND_SPEED
+- SFTP: avoid downloading negative sizes!
   
-  When detecting that the send or recv speed, the multi interface changes
-  state to TOOFAST and previously there was no timeout set that would
-  force a recheck but it would rely on the application to somehow call
-  libcurl anyway. This now sets a timeout for a suitable future time to
-  check again if the average transfer speed is then below the threshold
-  again.
+  It is still not clarified exactly why this happens, but libssh2
+  sometimes report a negative file size for the remote SFTP file and that
+  deeply confuses libcurl (or crashes it) so this precaution is added to
+  avoid badness.

-- multi: support timeouts
+- TODO-RELEASE: drop curl_easy_setoptv
   
-  Curl_expire() is now expanded to hold a list of timeouts for each easy
-  handle. Only the closest in time will be the one used as the primary
-  timeout for the handle and will be used for the splay tree (which sorts
-  and lists all handles within the multi handle).
+  I haven't read any really convincing arguments for adding it
+
+- [Dirk Manske brought this change]
+
+  multi & hiper examples: updates and cleanups
   
-  When the main timeout has triggered/expired, the next timeout in time
-  that is kept in the list will be moved to the main timeout position and
-  used as the key to splay with. This way, all timeouts that are set with
-  Curl_expire() internally will end up as a proper timeout. Previously any
-  Curl_expire() that set a _later_ timeout than what was already set was
-  just silently ignored and thus missed.
+  all multi and hiper examples:
   
-  Setting Curl_expire() with timeout 0 (zero) will cancel all previously
-  added timeouts.
+  * don't loop curl_multi_perform calls, that was <7.20.0 style, currently
+    the exported multi functions will not return CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
   
-  Corrects known bug #62.
-
-- Curl_llist_insert_next: allow insertion first in the list
+  all hiper examples:
+  * renamed check_run_count to check_multi_info
+  * don't  compare current running handle count with previous value, this
+    was the wrong way to check for finished requests, simply call
+    curl_multi_info_read
+  * it's also safe to call curl_multi_remove_handle inside the
+    curl_multi_info_read loop.
   
-  When we specify the "insert after" entry as NULL, this function now
-  inserts the new entry first in the list.
-
-- multi: make curl_multi_info_read perform O(1)
+  ghiper.c:
+  * replaced curl_multi_socket (that function is marked as obsolete) calls
+    with curl_multi_socket_action calls (as in hiperfifo.c and
+    evhiperfifo.c)
   
-  Instead of looping over all attached easy handles, this now keeps a list
-  of messages in the multi handle. It allows curl_multi_info_read() to
-  perform O(1) no matter how many easy handles that are handled. This is
-  of importance since this function may be polled very frequently by apps
-  using the multi interface.
+  ghiper.c and evhiperfifo.c:
+  * be smart as hiperfifo.c, don't do uncessary curl_multi_* calls in
+    new_conn and main

-- callbacks: acknowledge progress callback error returns
+- multi: don't expire timeouts at disonnect or done
   
-  When the progress callback is called during the TCP connection, an error
-  return would accidentally not abort the operation as intended but would
-  instead be counted as a failure to connect to that particular IP and
-  libcurl would just continue to try the next. I made singleipconnect()
-  and trynextip() return CURLcode properly.
+  The functions Curl_disconnect() and Curl_done() are both used within the
+  scope of a single request so they cannot be allowed to use
+  Curl_expire(... 0) to kill all timeouts as there are some timeouts that
+  are set before a request that are supposed to remain until the request
+  is done.
   
-  Added bonus: it corrected the error code for bad --interface usages,
-  like tested in test 1084 and test 1085.
+  The timeouts are now instead cleared at curl_easy_cleanup() and when the
+  multi state machine changes a handle to the complete state.

+  As of curl-7.21.1 tunnelling ldap queries through HTTP Proxies is not
+  supported. Actually if --proxytunnel command-line option (or equivalent
+  CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL) is used for ldap queries like
+  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/... You are unable to successfully execute the
+  query. In facts ldap_*_bind is executed directly against the ldap server
+  and proxy is totally ignored. This is true for both openLDAP and

+  final ldap server through the HTTP proxy. As far as I know Microsoft

-  lib/Makefile.Watcom works fine already, for src/Makefile.Watcom we

+  As this function uses return code 0 to mean that there is no timeout, it

+  thus not timing out as accurately as it should.

-  - commented WINLDAPAPI and WINBERAPI since they broke with OW 1.8, and
-    it seems they're not needed (anymore?).
-  - added rule for hugehelp.c.cvs so that it will be created when not
-    already exist - this is required for building from a release tarball
-    since there we have no hugehelp.c.cvs, thus compilation broke.
-  - removed C_ARG creation from lib/Makefile.Watcom and use CFLAGS
-    directly as done too in src/Makefile.Watcom - this has the benefit
-    that we will see all active cflags and defines during compile.
-  - added LINK-ARG to src/Makefile.Watcom in order to better control
-    linker input.
-  - a couple of other minor makefile tweaks here and there ...
-  - added largefile support for Watcom builds to config-win32.h. Not yet

-  multi: fix condition that remove timers before trigger
+Daniel Stenberg (1 Sep 2010)
+- multi: fixes for timing out handles
   
-  curl_multi perform has two phases: run through every easy handle calling
-  multi_runsingle and remove expired timers (timer removal).
+  Add a timeout check for handles in the state machine so that they will
+  timeout in all states disregarding what actions that may or may not
+  happen.
   
-  If a small timer (e.g. 1-10ms) is set during multi_runsingle, then it's
-  possible that the timer has passed by when the timer removal runs. The
-  timer which was just added is then removed. This will potentially cause
-  the timer list to be empty and cause the next call to curl_multi_timeout
-  to return -1. Ideally, curl_multi_timeout should return 0 in this case.
+  Fixed a bug in socket_action introduced recently when looping over timed
+  out handles: it wouldn't assign the 'data' variable and thus it wouldn't
+  properly take care of handles.
   
-  One way to fix this is to move the struct timeval now = Curl_tvnow(); to
-  the top of curl_multi_perform. The change does that.
+  In the update_timer function, the code now checks if the timeout has
+  been removed and then it tells the application. Previously it would
+  always let the remaining timeout(s) just linger to expire later on.
 
-- [Constantine Sapuntzakis brought this change]
+- threaded resolver: no more expire 0 calls
+  
+  Curl_expire() set to 0 expires ALL timeouts so it should only be called
+  if we truly and really want to remove all timeouts for the handle.
 
-  threaded resolver: fix timeout issue
+- resolve_server: simplify code
   
-  Reset old timer first so we can set a new one further in the future.
+  Make use of the helper function Curl_timeleft() instead of duplicating
+  code.
 
-- configure: allow environments variable to override internals
+- multi: make sure the next timeout is used when one expires
   
-  configure checks for grep, egrep, sed and ar and set the variables GREP,
-  EGREP, SED and AR accordingly. We now let already set variables override
-  the internal choices to let users make decisions when they know the
-  right choice already. This is a regression as our configure script used
-  to allow this back before commit 0b57c475 (up to 7.18.2).
+  Each easy handle has a list of timeouts, so as soon as the main timeout
+  for a handle expires, we must make sure to get the next entry from the
+  list and re-add the handle to the splay tree.

-  upload: Avoid infinite loop when checking for auth bits
+Daniel Stenberg (29 Aug 2010)
+- multi: set timeouts when transfer begins
   
-  The test would loop forever if authtype bit 0 wasn't set.
+  When a new transfer is about to start we now set the proper timeouts to
+  expire for the multi interface if they are set for the handle. This is a
+  follow-up bugfix to make sure that easy handles timeout properly when
+  the times expire and the multi interface is used. This also improves
+  curl_multi_timeout().

+
+- [Fabian Keil brought this change]
+
+  If the m4 version isn't recognized at all, just say so
   
-  Since uploading from stdin is very likely to not work with anyauth and
-  its multi-phase probing for what authentication to actually use, alert
-  the user about it. Multi-phase negotiate almost certainly will involve
-  sending data and thus libcurl will need to rewind the stream to send
-  again, and it cannot do that with stdin.
+  'm4 version  found. You need a GNU m4 installed!' is a bit confusing.
 
-- http: don't enable chunked during authentication negotiations
+- HISTORY: mention the gopher story
+
+Dan Fandrich (25 Aug 2010)
+- Tweaked some test data files
   
-  As mentioned in bug report #2956968, the HTTP code wouldn't send the
-  first empty chunk during the auth negotiation phase of the HTTP request
-  sending, so the server would wait for data to come and libcurl would
-  wait for data to arrive... I've made the code not enable chunked
-  encoding until the auth negotiation is done and thus this scenario
-  doesn't occur anymore.
+  Fixed some issues that caused xmllint failures, added features
+  and keywords, fixed some quotes and removed some <strip> sections
+  that unnecessarily limited test checking.

-- --libcurl: list the tricky options instead of using [REMARK]
+- runtests: fix uninitialized variable warning
+
+- gopher tests: revert parts of gopher in the pingpong server
   
-  I think the [REMARK] and commented function calls cluttered the code a
-  bit too much and made the generated code ugly to read. Now we instead
-  track the remarks one specially and just lists them at the end of the
-  generated code more as additional information.
+  Introduced in the initial gopher commits, there was added logic to do
+  GOPHER test serving in the pingpong server but as it resembles HTTP much
+  more than FTP or SMTP, the gopher testing has been moved over to instead
+  use the sws (HTTP) server. This change simply removes unused code.

+- gopher: fix memory leak and busyloop
   
-  And additionally, don't show function or object pointers actual value

-  'objectpointer' instead.
+  The fix for the busyloop really only is a temporary work-around.  It
+  causes a BLOCKING behavior which is a NO-NO. This function should rather
+  be split up in a do and a doing piece where the pieces that aren't
+  possible to send now will be sent in the doing function repeatedly until
+  the entire request is sent.

-  In the generated code --libcurl makes, all calls to curl_easy_setopt()
-  that use *_LARGE options now have the value typecasted to curl_off_t, so
-  that it works correctly for 32bit systems with 64bit curl_off_t type.
+  HTTP allows that a server sends trailing headers after all the chunks
+  have been sent WITHOUT signalling their presence in the first response
+  headers. The "Trailer:" header is only a SHOULD there and as we need to
+  handle the situation even without that header I made libcurl ignore
+  Trailer: completely.
+  
+  Test case 1116 was added to verify this and to make sure we handle more
+  than one trailer header properly.

-- multi: CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET doesn't work after remove_handle
+- TODO: we now support RTMP
+
+- TODO: done "NTLM with other crypto functions"
   
-  When curl_multi_remove_handle() is called and an easy handle is returned
-  to the connection cache held in the multi handle, then we cannot allow
-  CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to extract it since that will more or less encourage
-  that the user uses the socket while it can get used by libcurl again.
+  Since NTLM was made to work with the NSS API as well, the primary SSL
+  alternatives will be built with NTLM support in libcurl.
+
+- TODO: fixed "Make curl_multi_info_read faster"

-- http_ntlm: add support for NSS
+Daniel Stenberg (23 Aug 2010)
+- RESUME_FROM: clarify what ftp uploads do
   
-  When configured with '--without-ssl --with-nss', NTLM authentication
-  now uses NSS crypto library for MD5 and DES.  For MD4 we have a local
-  implementation in that case.  More details are available at
-  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/603783
+  The numerical value passed to CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM for FTP uploads is
+  interpreted and used as position where to resume the _reading_ of the
+  local file and it will "blindly" append that data on the remote
+  file. This was certainly not clear in the docs previously.
   
-  In order to get it working, curl_global_init() must be called with
-  CURL_GLOBAL_SSL or CURL_GLOBAL_ALL.  That's necessary because NSS needs
-  to be initialized globally and we do so only when the NSS library is
-  actually required by protocol.  The mentioned call of curl_global_init()
-  is responsible for creating of the initialization mutex.

+  Curl_is_connected: use correct errno
   
-  There was also slightly changed the NSS initialization scenario, in
-  particular, loading of the NSS PEM module.  It used to be loaded always
-  right after the NSS library was initialized.  Now the library is
-  initialized as soon as any SSL or NTLM is required, while the PEM module
-  is prevented from being loaded until the SSL is actually required.
+  The correctly extracted errno contents were mistakenly overwritten by a newer
+  value that wasn't the correct error value.

-- glob: backslash escaping bug
+- cmdline: make -F type= accept ;charset=
   
-  curl didn't properly handle escaping characters in a URL with the use of
-  backslash. It did an attempt, but that failed as reported in bug
-  3022551. The described example was using the URL
-  "http://example.com?{AB,C\,D}".
+  The -F option allows some custom parameters within the given string, and
+  those strings are separated with semicolons. You can for example specify
+  "name=daniel;type=text/plain" to set content-type for the
+  field. However, the use of semicolons like that made it not work fine if
+  you specified one within the content-type, like for:
+  "name=daniel;type=text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
+  ... as the second one would be seen as a separator and "charset" is no
+  parameter curl knows anything about so it was just silently discarded.
   
-  I've now removed the special-handling of letters following the backslash
-  and I also removed the bad extra check that triggered this particular
-  bug.
+  The new logic now checks if the semicolon and following keyword looks
+  like a parameter it knows about and if it isn't it is assumed to be
+  meant to be used within the content-type string itself.

-- release-notes: sync up with recent commits
+Guenter Knauf (20 Aug 2010)
+- Added mk-ca-bundle.vbs script.
+  
+  The script works exactly same as the Perl one except for one thing:
+  when the text descriptions generated with openssl are included then
+  the md5 fingerprints are missing; seems openssl has either a bug or
+  a feature which prints the md5 fingerprint output to stdout instead
+  of writing them to specified file; this script could here do the same
+  as what the Perl scripr does (redirect stdout into file) but this
+  makes the script take up double the time because it needs to launch
+  cmd.exe 140 times (fo each openssl call). So I think for now we just
+  ommit the md5 fingerprints, and see if openssl will be fixed.

-- multi_socket: re-use of same socket without notifying app
+Daniel Stenberg (19 Aug 2010)
+- [Julien Chaffraix brought this change]
+
+  test: added test 579 to verify progress callback for chunked post
   
-  When a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses and the first one
-  tried doesn't work, the socket for the second attempt may get dropped on
-  the floor, causing the request to eventually time out. The issue is that
-  when using kqueue (as on mac and bsd platforms) instead of select, the
-  kernel removes the first fd from kqueue when it is closed (in trynextip,
-  connect.c:503). Trynextip() then goes on to open a new socket, which
-  gets assigned the same number as the one it just closed. Later in
-  multi.c, socket_cb is not called because the fd is already in
-  multi->sockhash, so the new socket is never added to kqueue.
+  The 66 bytes checked are those 38 bytes with the chunked encoding
+  headers added: 8+8+10+35+5 = 66
   
-  The correct fix is to ensure that socket_cb is called to remove the fd
-  when trynextip() closes the socket, and again to re-add it after
-  singleipsocket(). I'm not sure how to cleanly do that, but the attached
-  patch works around the problem in an admittedly kludgy way by delaying
-  the close to ensure that the newly-opened socket gets a different fd.
+  The three-letter words become 8 bytes on the wire because they are sent
+  like: "3\r\none\r\n"
   
-  Daniel's added comment: I didn't spot a way to easily do a nicer fix so
-  I've proceeded with Ben's patch.
+  ... and there's the trailing 5 bytes write after the four lines since
+  the final chunk is sent (which is "0\r\n\r\n").

+  enough) filed in Debian's bug tracker for the "wmweather+" tool.

+- THANKS: added contributors from 7.21.1
 
-- ignore: CHANGES.dist gets generated by maketgz
+- multi: two fixes done
 
-- CHANGES: move all contents from CHANGES to CHANGES.0
+- multi: use timeouts properly for MAX_RECV/SEND_SPEED
   
-  CHANGES is no longer used for manually edited content. It is to
-  be generated automatically by maketgz when we make release
-  tarballs.
+  When detecting that the send or recv speed, the multi interface changes
+  state to TOOFAST and previously there was no timeout set that would
+  force a recheck but it would rely on the application to somehow call
+  libcurl anyway. This now sets a timeout for a suitable future time to
+  check again if the average transfer speed is then below the threshold
+  again.
 
-- log2changes: correct command line, fix tag usage, change Version output
+- multi: support timeouts
   
-  --decorate=full is needed with my git 1.7.1 to get the necessary
-  output so that the previous edit would work to extract the
-  Version stuff.
+  Curl_expire() is now expanded to hold a list of timeouts for each easy
+  handle. Only the closest in time will be the one used as the primary
+  timeout for the handle and will be used for the splay tree (which sorts
+  and lists all handles within the multi handle).
   
-  ... but I had to edit how the refs/tags was extracted since it
-  had a little flaw that made it miss the 7.20.1 output.
+  When the main timeout has triggered/expired, the next timeout in time
+  that is kept in the list will be moved to the main timeout position and
+  used as the key to splay with. This way, all timeouts that are set with
+  Curl_expire() internally will end up as a proper timeout. Previously any
+  Curl_expire() that set a _later_ timeout than what was already set was
+  just silently ignored and thus missed.
   
-  Finally, I changed so that Version is outputted even more similar
-  to how CHANGES does it.

-Dan Fandrich (21 Jun 2010)
-- Make the output of log2changes.pl even more closely match CHANGES
+  Setting Curl_expire() with timeout 0 (zero) will cancel all previously

-  option).

-- log2changes: first version of the git log to CHANGES conversion script
-  
-  $ git log --pretty=fuller --no-color --date=short | ./log2changes.pl
+- Curl_llist_insert_next: allow insertion first in the list
   
-  Of course, limiting the log output with a range like with
-  "[tag]..HEAD" appended can be very useful too.
+  When we specify the "insert after" entry as NULL, this function now
+  inserts the new entry first in the list.
 
-- sendrecv: treat all negative values from send/recv as errors
+- multi: make curl_multi_info_read perform O(1)
   
-  For example the libssh2 based functions return other negative
-  values than -1 to signal errors and it is important that we catch
-  them properly. Right before this, various failures from libssh2
-  were treated as negative download amounts which caused havoc.
+  Instead of looping over all attached easy handles, this now keeps a list
+  of messages in the multi handle. It allows curl_multi_info_read() to
+  perform O(1) no matter how many easy handles that are handled. This is
+  of importance since this function may be polled very frequently by apps
+  using the multi interface.

+- runtests: clear old setenv remainders before test
   
-  1) no need to call the progress function twice when in the

+  Due to the layout of the singletest function there are situations where
+  it returns before it clears the environment variables that were

-  2) Make sure that the progress callback's return code is
-  acknowledged when used
-
-- multi: call the progress callback in all states
+  This change makes sure to clear all custom variables that may be laying
+  around from a previous round, before running a test case.
   
-  As long as no error is reported, the progress function can get
-  called. This may be a little TOO often so we should keep an eye
-  on this and possibly make this conditional somehow.

-  OpenSSL: fix spurious SSL connection aborts
-  
-  Was seeing spurious SSL connection aborts using libcurl and
-  OpenSSL. I tracked it down to uncleared error state on the
-  OpenSSL error stack - patch attached deals with that.
-  
-  Rough idea of problem:
-  
-  Code that uses libcurl calls some library that uses OpenSSL but
-  don't clear the OpenSSL error stack after an error.
-  
-  ssluse.c calls SSL_read which eventually gets an EWOULDBLOCK from
-  the OS. Returns -1 to indicate an error
-  
-  ssluse.c calls SSL_get_error. First thing, SSL_get_error calls
-  ERR_get_error to check the OpenSSL error stack, finds an old
-  error and returns SSL_ERROR_SSL instead of SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or
-  SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.
-  
-  ssluse.c returns an error and aborts the connection
-  
-  Solution:
-  
-  Clear the openssl error stack before calling SSL_* operation if
-  we're going to call SSL_get_error afterwards.

+- curl_easy_setopt.3: rename stream to userdata

+  call that argument 'userdata' to make it more obvious that it is in fact
+  possible to set by the application.
   
-  This is much more likely to happen with multi because it's easier
-  to intersperse other calls to the OpenSSL library in the same
-  thread.

+  
+  When libcurl internally decided to wait for a 100-continue header, there
+  was no call to the timeout function so there was no timeout callback

-- multi_socket: handles timer inaccuracy better for timeouts
+- Curl_connected_proxy: skip the bits.tcpconnect check
+  
+  Simply because the TCP might be connected already we cannot skip the
+  proxy connect procedure. We need to be careful to not overload more
+  meaning to the bits.tcpconnect field like this.
   
-  Igor Novoseltsev reported a problem with the multi socket API and
-  using timeouts and timers. It boiled down to a problem with
-  libcurl's use of GetTickCount() interally to figure out the
-  current time, while Igor's own application code used another
-  function call.
+  With this fix, SOCKS proxies work again when the multi interface is
+  used. I believe this regression was added with commit 4b351d018e,
+  released as 7.20.1.
   
-  It made his app call the socket API timeout function a bit
-  _before_ libcurl would consider the timeout to trigger, and that
-  could easily lead to timeouts or stalls in the app. It seems
-  GetTickCount() in general often has no better resolution than
-  16ms and switching to the alternative function
-  QueryPerformanceCounter has its share of problems:
-  http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=106
+  Left todo: add a test case that verifies this functionality that
+  prevents us from breaking it again in the future!
   
-  We address this problem by simply having libcurl treat timers
-  that already has occured or will occur within 40ms subject for
-  treatment. I'm confident that there are other implementations and
-  operating systems with similarly in accurate timer functions so
-  it makes sense to have applied generically and I don't believe we
-  sacrifice much by adding a 40ms inaccuracy on these timeouts.

-- OpenSSL: multi interface handshake could hang
+  CUSTOMREQUEST: shouldn't be disabled when HTTP is disabled
   
-  John-Mark Bell filed bug #3000052 that identified a problem (with
-  an associated patch) with the OpenSSL handshake state machine
-  when the multi interface is used:
-  
-  Performing an https request using a curl multi handle and using
-  select or epoll to wait for events results in a hang. It appears
-  that the cause is the fix for bug #2958179, which makes
-  ossl_connect_common unconditionally return from the step 2 loop
-  when fetching from a multi handle.
-  
-  When ossl_connect_step2 has completed, it updates
-  connssl->connecting_state to ssl_connect_3. ossl_connect_common
-  will then return to the caller, as a multi handle is in
-  use. Eventually, the client code will call curl_multi_fdset to
-  obtain an updated fdset to select or epoll on. For https
-  requests, curl_multi_fdset will cause https_getsock to be called.
-  https_getsock will only return a socket handle if the
-  connecting_state is ssl_connect_2_reading or
-  ssl_connect_2_writing.  Therefore, the client will never obtain a
-  valid fdset, and thus not drive the multi handle, resulting in a
-  hang.

-  Sebastian V reported bug #3000056 identifying a problem with

-  it didn't properly ignore the response body of the 30X response
-  if that response was using compressed Content-Encoding!

-- multi interface: missed storing connection time
-  
-  Dirk Manske reported a regression. When connecting with the multi
-  interface, there were situations where libcurl wouldn't store
-  connect time correctly as it used to (and is documented to) do.
-  
-  Using his fine sample program we could repeat it, and I wrote up
-  test case 573 using that code. The problem does not easily show
-  itself using the local test suite though.
-  
-  The fix, also as suggested by Dirk, is a bit on the ugly side as
-  it adds yet another call to Curl_verboseconnect() and setting the
-  TIMER_CONNECT time.  That situation is subject for some closer
-  inspection in the future.
+- [Constantine Sapuntzakis brought this change]
 
-- verboseconnect: so the verbose checking within the function
+  examples: add curl_multi_timeout
   
-  As the function is used more than once and libcurl can be built
-  without it, do the conditional check within the verboseconnect()
-  function itself.
+  Make the multi-interface using examples use curl_multi_timeout to
+  properly educate users how to do things.

-  sendrecv: split the I/O handling into private handler
+  multi: fix condition that remove timers before trigger
   
-  Howard Chu brought the bulk work of this patch that properly
-  moves out the sending and recving of data to the parts of the
-  code that are properly responsible for the various ways of doing
-  so.
+  curl_multi perform has two phases: run through every easy handle calling
+  multi_runsingle and remove expired timers (timer removal).
   
-  Daniel Stenberg assisted with polishing a few bits and fixed some
-  minor flaws in the original patch.
+  If a small timer (e.g. 1-10ms) is set during multi_runsingle, then it's
+  possible that the timer has passed by when the timer removal runs. The
+  timer which was just added is then removed. This will potentially cause
+  the timer list to be empty and cause the next call to curl_multi_timeout
+  to return -1. Ideally, curl_multi_timeout should return 0 in this case.
   
-  Another upside of this patch is that we now abuse CURLcodes less
-  with the "magic" -1 return codes and instead use CURLE_AGAIN more
-  consistently.

+Dan Fandrich (9 Jul 2010)
+- Improved the Android build instructions
 
-- [Ben Greear brought this change]
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Jul 2010)
+- [Tor Arntsen brought this change]
 
-  telnet: Allow programatic use of telnet.
+  upload: Avoid infinite loop when checking for auth bits
   
-  The main change is to allow input from user-specified methods,
-  when they are specified with CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.
-  All calls to fflush(stdout) in telnet.c were removed, which makes
-  using 'curl telnet://foo.com' painful since prompts and other data
-  are not always returned to the user promptly.  Use
-  'curl --no-buffer telnet://foo.com' instead.  In general,
-  the user should have their CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION do a fflush
-  for interactive use.
+  The test would loop forever if authtype bit 0 wasn't set.
+
+- upload: warn users trying to upload from stdin with anyauth
   
-  Also fix assumption that reading from stdin never returns < 0.
-  Old code could crash in that case.
+  Since uploading from stdin is very likely to not work with anyauth and
+  its multi-phase probing for what authentication to actually use, alert
+  the user about it. Multi-phase negotiate almost certainly will involve
+  sending data and thus libcurl will need to rewind the stream to send
+  again, and it cannot do that with stdin.
+
+- http: don't enable chunked during authentication negotiations
   
-  Call progress functions in telnet main loop.
+  As mentioned in bug report #2956968, the HTTP code wouldn't send the
+  first empty chunk during the auth negotiation phase of the HTTP request
+  sending, so the server would wait for data to come and libcurl would
+  wait for data to arrive... I've made the code not enable chunked
+  encoding until the auth negotiation is done and thus this scenario
+  doesn't occur anymore.

+- multi: CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET doesn't work after remove_handle

+  CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to extract it since that will more or less encourage
+  that the user uses the socket while it can get used by libcurl again.
   
-  Make sure we don't call memcpy() if the argument is NULL even
-  though we also passed a zero length then, as the clang analyzer
-  whined and we want to limit warnings (even false positives) when
-  they're this easy to fix.
+  Without this fix, we'd get a segfault in Curl_getconnectinfo() trying to

-- test536: do not fail with threaded DNS resolver

+  is responsible for creating of the initialization mutex.
   
-  Also tweaked comments in certain examples using curl_multi_fdset().
+  There was also slightly changed the NSS initialization scenario, in
+  particular, loading of the NSS PEM module.  It used to be loaded always
+  right after the NSS library was initialized.  Now the library is
+  initialized as soon as any SSL or NTLM is required, while the PEM module

+  
+  When a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses and the first one

+  the floor, causing the request to eventually time out. The issue is that
+  when using kqueue (as on mac and bsd platforms) instead of select, the
+  kernel removes the first fd from kqueue when it is closed (in trynextip,
+  connect.c:503). Trynextip() then goes on to open a new socket, which
+  gets assigned the same number as the one it just closed. Later in
+  multi.c, socket_cb is not called because the fd is already in
+  multi->sockhash, so the new socket is never added to kqueue.
+  
+  The correct fix is to ensure that socket_cb is called to remove the fd
+  when trynextip() closes the socket, and again to re-add it after
+  singleipsocket(). I'm not sure how to cleanly do that, but the attached
+  patch works around the problem in an admittedly kludgy way by delaying
+  the close to ensure that the newly-opened socket gets a different fd.

 Enable ASCII transfer when using FTP or LDAP. For FTP, this can also be
 enforced by using an URL that ends with ";type=A". This option causes data
 sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

The passive mode will not initiate the shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server. (Added in 7.16.2) 
-<p class="level0"><a name="-F--form"></a><span class="nroffip">-F/--form &lt;name=content&gt;</span> 
-<p class="level1">(HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388. This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the symbol &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the &lt; makes a text field and just get the contents for that text field from a file. 
-<p class="level1">Example, to send your password file to the server, where 'password' is the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the input: 
-<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">curl</span> -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com 
-<p class="level1">To read content from stdin instead of a file, use - as the filename. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs. 
-<p class="level1">You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using 'type=', in a manner similar to: 
-<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">curl</span> -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" url.com 
-<p class="level1">or 
-<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">curl</span> -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" url.com 
-<p class="level1">You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload part by setting filename=, like this: 
-<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">curl</span> -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" url.com 
-<p class="level1">See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

 <p class="level1">(HTTP) Similar to <span Class="emphasis">--form</span> except that the value string for the named parameter is used literally. Leading '@' and '&lt;' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no special meaning.

Remove an internal header by giving a replacement without content on the right side of the colon, as in: -H "Host:". 
 <p class="level1">curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus <span Class="bold">not</span> add that as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage returns, they will only mess things up for you.

Using this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a specified address and prevent the otherwise normally resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of /etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The port number should be the number used for the specific protocol the host will be used for. It means you need several entries if you want to provide address for the same host but different ports. 
 <p class="level1">This option can be used many times to add many host names to resolve.

 <p class="level0"><a name="--retry"></a><span class="nroffip">--retry &lt;num&gt;</span> 
 <p class="level1">If a transient error is returned when curl tries to perform a transfer, it will retry this number of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which is the default). Transient error means either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 5xx response code. 
 <p class="level1">When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one second and then for all forthcoming retries it will double the waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be the delay between the rest of the retries.  By using <a class="emphasis" href="#--retry-delay">--retry-delay</a> you disable this exponential backoff algorithm. See also <a class="emphasis" href="#--retry-max-time">--retry-max-time</a> to limit the total time allowed for retries. (Added in 7.12.3) 
 <p class="level1">If this option is used multiple times, the last occurrence decide the amount.

This option is only interesting if <a class="emphasis" href="#--retry">--retry</a> is also used. Setting this delay to zero will make curl use the default backoff time. (Added in 7.12.3)

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 This function converts the given input string to an URL encoded string and
 returns that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not a-z,
-A-Z or 0-9 are converted to their "URL escaped" version (%NN where NN is a
-two-digit hexadecimal number).
+A-Z, 0-9, '-', '.', '_' or '~' are converted to their "URL escaped" version
+(%NN where NN is a two-digit hexadecimal number).
 
 If the \fBlength\fP argument is set to 0 (zero), \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP
 uses strlen() on the input \fBurl\fP to find out the size.
 
 You must \fIcurl_free(3)\fP the returned string when you're done with it.

 curl_formadd() is used to append sections when building a multipart/formdata

-the \fIfirstitem\fP pointer as parameter to \fBCURLOPT_HTTPPOST\fP.
-\fIlastitem\fP is set after each call and on repeated invokes it should be

 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">time zone items</span> Specifies international time zone. There are a few acronyms supported, but in general you should instead use the specific relative time compared to UTC. Supported formats include: -1200, MST, +0100. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">day of the week items</span> Specifies a day of the week. Days of the week may be spelled out in full (using english): `Sunday', `Monday', etc or they may be abbreviated to their first three letters. This is usually not info that adds anything. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pure numbers</span> If a decimal number of the form YYYYMMDD appears, then YYYY is read as the year, MM as the month number and DD as the day of the month, for the specified calendar date.

The <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform(3)</a> function should be called as soon as one of them is ready to be read from or written to. 
 <p class="level0">To be sure to have up-to-date results, you should call <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_perform</span> until it does not return CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM prior to calling <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_fdset</span>.  This will make sure that libcurl has updated the handles' socket states. 
 <p class="level0">If no file descriptors are set by libcurl, <span Class="emphasis">max_fd</span> will contain -1 when this function returns. Otherwise it will contain the higher descriptor number libcurl set. 
 <p class="level0">When doing select(), you should use <span Class="bold">curl_multi_timeout</span> to figure out how long to wait for action.

 <p class="level0">When the application has detected action on a socket handled by libcurl, it should call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action(3)</a> with the <span Class="bold">sockfd</span> argument set to the socket with the action. When the events on a socket are known, they can be passed as an events bitmask <span Class="bold">ev_bitmask</span> by first setting <span Class="bold">ev_bitmask</span> to 0, and then adding using bitwise OR (|) any combination of events to be chosen from CURL_CSELECT_IN, CURL_CSELECT_OUT or CURL_CSELECT_ERR. When the events on a socket are unknown, pass 0 instead, and libcurl will test the descriptor internally. 
 <p class="level0">At return, the integer <span Class="bold">running_handles</span> points to will contain the number of running easy handles within the multi handle. When this number reaches zero, all transfers are complete/done. When you call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action(3)</a> on a specific socket and the counter decreases by one, it DOES NOT necessarily mean that this exact socket/transfer is the one that completed. Use <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_info_read.html">curl_multi_info_read(3)</a> to figure out which easy handle that completed. 
 <p class="level0">The <a class="bold" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action(3)</a> functions inform the application about updates in the socket (file descriptor) status by doing none, one, or multiple calls to the socket callback function set with the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION option to <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_setopt.html">curl_multi_setopt(3)</a>. They update the status with changes since the previous time the callback was called.

You can also use the <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_timeout.html">curl_multi_timeout(3)</a> function to poll the value at any given time, but for an event-based system using the callback is far better than relying on polling the timeout value. <a name="CALLBACK"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CALLBACK DETAILS</h2>

 <p class="level0">You set properties and options for this handle using <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt(3)</a>. They control how the subsequent transfer or transfers will be made. Options remain set in the handle until set again to something different. Alas, multiple requests using the same handle will use the same options. 
 <p class="level0">Many of the options you set in libcurl are "strings", pointers to data terminated with a zero byte. When you set strings with <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt(3)</a>, libcurl makes its own copy so that they don't need to be kept around in your application after being set[4].

The file should be made private so that only the user may read it (see also the "Security Considerations" chapter), as it might contain the password in plain text. libcurl has the ability to use this file to figure out what set of user name and password to use for a particular host. As an extension to the normal functionality, libcurl also supports this file for non-FTP protocols such as HTTP. To make curl use this file, use the CURLOPT_NETRC option: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_NETRC, 1L);

 <p class="level0">Ok, so what if you want to post binary data that also requires you to set the Content-Type: header of the post? Well, binary posts prevent libcurl from being able to do strlen() on the data to figure out the size, so therefore we must tell libcurl the size of the post data. Setting headers in libcurl requests are done in a generic way, by building a list of our own headers and then passing that list to libcurl.

To make that easier, libcurl provides <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_formadd.html">curl_formadd(3)</a>. Using this function, you add parts to the form. When you're done adding parts, you post the whole form. 
 <p class="level0">The following example sets two simple text parts with plain textual contents, and then a file with binary contents and uploads the whole thing. 
-<p class="level0"><pre>

 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">Multipart formposts are chains of parts using MIME-style separators and headers. It means that each one of these separate parts get a few headers set that describe the individual content-type, size etc. To enable your application to handicraft this formpost even more, libcurl allows you to supply your own set of custom headers to such an individual form part. You can of course supply headers to as many parts as you like, but this little example will show how you set headers to one specific part when you add that to the post handle: 
-<p class="level0"><pre>
-<p class="level0">&nbsp;struct curl_slist *headers=NULL;
- &nbsp;headers = curl_slist_append(headers, "Content-Type: text/xml");
- <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_formadd(&post, &last,

- &nbsp;             CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER, headers,
- &nbsp;             CURLFORM_END);
- <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_perform(easyhandle); /* post away! */
- <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_formfree(post); /* free post */
- &nbsp;curl_slist_free_all(headers); /* free custom header list */
- </pre>
-

 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">Since all options on an easyhandle are "sticky", they remain the same until changed even if you do call <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_perform.html">curl_easy_perform(3)</a>, you may need to tell curl to go back to a plain GET request if you intend to do one as your next request. You force an easyhandle to go back to GET by using the CURLOPT_HTTPGET option: 
 <p class="level0">&nbsp;curl_easy_setopt(easyhandle, CURLOPT_HTTPGET, 1L); 
 <p class="level0">Just setting CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS to "" or NULL will *not* stop libcurl from doing a POST. It will just make it POST without any data to send! 
 <p class="level0"><a name="Showing"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Showing Progress</h2>
 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">For historical and traditional reasons, libcurl has a built-in progress meter that can be switched on and then makes it present a progress meter in your terminal. 
 <p class="level0">Switch on the progress meter by, oddly enough, setting CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS to zero. This option is set to 1 by default. 
 <p class="level0">For most applications however, the built-in progress meter is useless and what instead is interesting is the ability to specify a progress callback. The function pointer you pass to libcurl will then be called on irregular intervals with information about the current transfer. 
 <p class="level0">Set the progress callback by using CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION. And pass a pointer to a function that matches this prototype: 
-<p class="level0"><pre>
-<p class="level0">&nbsp;int progress_callback(void *clientp,
- &nbsp;                      double dltotal,
- &nbsp;                      double dlnow,
- &nbsp;                      double ultotal,
- &nbsp;                      double ulnow);
- </pre>

 <p class="level0">
 <p class="level0">If any of the input arguments is unknown, a 0 will be passed. The first argument, the 'clientp' is the pointer you pass to libcurl with CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA. libcurl won't touch it.
