-Version 7.26.0 (24 May 2012)
-
-Daniel Stenberg (24 May 2012)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with ef60fdbd73
+Version 7.27.0 (27 Jul 2012)
 
-Version 7.26.0 (24 May 2012)
-  
+Guenter Knauf (27 Jul 2012)
+- Fixed compiler warning 'unused parameter'.
 
-Version 7.26.0 (24 May 2012)
-  Just before 7.26.0 is about to ship
+- Added prototypes to kill compiler warning.
 
-Steve Holme (22 May 2012)
-- smtp: Fixed an issue with the multi-interface always sending postdata
-  
-  Due to the result code being reset to CURLE_OK when smtp_dophase_done()
-  was called, postdata would incorrectly be sent to the server when the
-  MAIL FROM or RCPT command was rejected.
-  
-  As such, libcurl would return the wrong result code from performing the
-  operation and additionally set CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE to be that
-  returned by the postdata command.
+- Added --with-winidn to configure.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-05/0108.html
-  Reported by: Gokhan Sengun
+  This needs another look from the configure experts. I tested that
+  it works so far with MinGW64 cross-compiler; libcurl builds and
+  links fine, but curl not yet ...
 
-- DOCS: Updated version number for features added in the pending release
+Daniel Stenberg (27 Jul 2012)
+- [Ant Bryan brought this change]
 
-Daniel Stenberg (22 May 2012)
-- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]
+  Update man page info on --metalink and typo.
 
-  Fixed compile error with GNUTLS+NETTLE
+- RELEASE-NOTES: remove mentioned of bug never in a release
   
-  In nettle/md5.h, md5_init and md5_update are defined as macros to
-  nettle_md5_init and nettle_md5_update respectively.  This causes
-  error when using MD5_params.md5_init and md5_update.  This patch
-  renames these members as md5_init_func and md5_update_func to
-  avoid name conflict. For completeness, MD5_params.md5_final was
-  also renamed as md5_final_func.
+  The --silent bug came with 7561a0fc834c435 which was never in a release.
+  Pointed out by Kamil Dudka
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 33b815e894fb
   
-  The changes in curl_ntlm_core.c is conversion error and fixed by
-  casting to proper type.
+  4 more bugfixes, 3 more contributors
 
-- TODO-RELEASE: mention the pending biggies for 7.27.0
+Guenter Knauf (26 Jul 2012)
+- Changed Windows IDN text to 'WinIDN'.
+  
+  Synced the output to the same short form as we now use for
+  Windows SSL (WinSSL).
 
-- [Jan Ehrhardt brought this change]
+Daniel Stenberg (25 Jul 2012)
+- [Nick Zitzmann brought this change]
 
-  winbuild: fix IPv6 enabled build
+  darwinssl: fixed freeze involving the multi interface
   
-  The existing check was wrong so IPv6 support would never be enabled
+  Previously the curl_multi interface would freeze if darwinssl was
+  enabled and at least one of the handles tried to connect to a Web site
+  using HTTPS. Removed the "wouldblock" state darwinssl was using because
+  I figured out a solution for our "would block but in which direction?"
+  dilemma.
 
-- 7.26.0: will be the next release version
+Guenter Knauf (25 Jul 2012)
+- Added support for tls-srp to MinGW builds.

-- Updated dependency libary versions.
+  Reported by: Santhana Todatry
 
-Daniel Stenberg (20 May 2012)
-- curl-config.1: fix curl-config usage in example
+- keepalive: multiply value for OS-specific units
   
-  The curl-config command must be used twice in the single command line to
-  work properly in some environments.
+  DragonFly uses milliseconds, while our API and Linux use full seconds.

-Steve Holme (17 May 2012)
-- smtp: Fixed non-escaping of dot character at beginning of line
-  
-  A dot character at the beginning of a line would not be escaped to a
-  double dot as required by RFC-2821, instead it would be deleted by the
-  mail server. Please see section 4.5.2 of the RFC for more information.
+Kamil Dudka (22 Jul 2012)
+- http: print reason phrase from HTTP status line on error
   
-  Note: This fix also simplifies the detection of repeated CRLF.CRLF
-  combinations, such as CRLF.CRLF.CRLF, a little rather than having to
-  advance the eob counter to 2.
+  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/676596
 
-Daniel Stenberg (16 May 2012)
-- FAQ: updated 1.10 How many are using curl?
+- tool_operate: fix misplaced initialization of orig_noprogress
   
-  Now linking to http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2012/05/16/300m-users/
+  ... and orig_isatty which caused --silent to be entirely ignored in case
+  the standard output was redirected to a file!
 
-- disable-versioned-symbols: removed superfluous 'fi'
+Daniel Stenberg (21 Jul 2012)
+- [Anton Yabchinskiy brought this change]
+
+  Client's "qop" value should not be quoted (RFC2617, section 3.2.2).
+
+Guenter Knauf (21 Jul 2012)
+- Fixed typo.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Jul 2012)
+- make: make distclean work again
   
-  The commit e315927a1a left this in
+  The clean-local hook needed some polish to make sure make distclean
+  works. Added comment describing why.
 
-- MakefileBuild.vc: use the correct IDN variable
+- test Makefile: only feature 'unit' once in the list of dirs
+
+Dan Fandrich (20 Jul 2012)
+- Fixed some typos in documentation
+
+Guenter Knauf (20 Jul 2012)
+- Fixed CR issue with Win32 version on MSYS.
   
-  The variable that control IDN enablement is called USE_IDN within these
-  Makefiles
+  Previous fix didnt work on Linux ...
 
-- [Pierre Chapuis brought this change]
+- Fixed CR issue with Win32 version on MSYS.
 
-  autoconf: improve handling of versioned symbols
+- Fixed MSYS <-> Windows path convertion.
   
-  It checks whether versioned symbols should be enabled before checking
-  whether it is possible (i.e. the linker supports --version-script) or
-  not. This avoids a useless warning when building cURL on a platform that
-  does not use GNU ld.
+  Replaced the Windows real path from mount hack with a more
+  reliable and simpler hack: the MSYS shell has a builtin pwd
+  which understands a -W option which does convertion to Windows
+  paths. Tested and confirmed that this works on all MSYS versions
+  I have back to a 3 year old one.
+
+- Follow-up fix to detect SSL libs with MinGW.
   
-  Moreover, it fixes broken indentation of this chunk of code.
+  1) the check for winssl needs to come before nss check
+  2) the SSL checks must begin with a new if or else we will
+  never find any SSL lib with MinGW.
 
-- curl.1: clarify -x usage
+- Tell git to not convert configure-related files.
+
+- Trial to teach runtests.pl about WinSSL.
+
+- Fixed warning 'uninitialized value in numeric gt'.
   
-  1 - fix the syntax in the .IP line
+  This is a MSYS/MinGW-only warning; full warning text is:
+  Use of uninitialized value in numeric gt (>) at ../../curl/tests/runtests.pl line 2227.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (15 Jul 2012)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 9d11716933616
   
-  2 - Provided user names and passwords are URL decoded by libcurl
+  Fixed 6 bugs, added 3 contributors
+
+- multi_runsingle: added precaution against easy_conn NULL pointer
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3525935
+  In many states the easy_conn pointer is referenced and just assumed to
+  be working. This is an added extra check since analyzing indicates
+  there's a risk we can end up in these states with a NULL pointer there.
 
-- NTLM: is supported in GnuTLS builds too
+- getparam: fix the GetStr() macro
   
-  ... since commit 9a4c887c4a7 introduced in libcurl 7.19.4
+  It should return PARAM_NO_MEM if the strdup fails. Spotted by
+  clang-analyzer
 
-- TODO: happy eyeballs is now RFC6555
+Guenter Knauf (15 Jul 2012)
+- Tell git to not convert configure-related files.
 
-- my_useragent: shorten user-agent
+Daniel Stenberg (13 Jul 2012)
+- parse_proxy: remove dead assignment
   
-  The built-in user-agent will now only say curl/[version] and nothing
-  else in an attempt to decrease overhead in HTTP requests.
+  Spotted by clang-analyzer
 
-- CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION: works for non-HTTP protocols too
+- ftp_do_more: add missing check of return code
+  
+  Spotted by clang-analyzer. The return code was never checked, just
+  stored.
 
-Claes Jakobsson (3 May 2012)
-- Add note about default timeout in CURLOPT_TIMEOUT
+- getinfo: use va_end and cut off Curl_ from static funcs

-- URL parse: reject numerical IPv6 addresses outside brackets
+- SWS: use of uninitialized memory fix
   
-  Roman Mamedov spotted (in
-  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=670126) that curl would
-  not complain when given a URL with an IPv6 numerical address without
-  brackets. It would simply cut off the last ":[hex]" part and thus not
-  work correctly.
+  I made "connmon" not get initialized properly before use, and I use the
+  big hammer and make sure we always clear the entire struct to avoid any
+  problem like this in the future.
+
+- test48: verify that HEAD doesn't close extra
   
-  That's a URL using an illegal syntax and now libcurl will instead return
-  a clear error code and error message detailing the error.
+  Two commits ago, we fixed a bug where the connction would be closed
+  prematurely after a HEAD. Now I added connection-monitor to test 48 and
+  added a second HEAD and make sure that both are sent over the same
+  connection.
   
-  The above mentioned bug report claims this to be a regression but
-  libcurl does not guarantee functionality when given URLs that aren't
-  following the URL spec (RFC3986 mostly). I consider the fact that it
-  used to handle this differently a mere coincidence.
+  This triggered a failure before the bug fix and now works. Will help us
+  avoid a future regression of this kind.

-
-- [Gokhan Sengun brought this change]
+  This makes verifying easier and makes us more sure curl closes the

+  accordingly and updated the docs for it.

-- Revert "sspi: Added version information"
+  A HEAD response has no body length and gets the headers like the
+  corresponding GET would so it should not get closed after the response
+  based on the same rules. This mistake caused connections that did HEAD
+  to get closed too often without a valid reason.

-Daniel Stenberg (20 Apr 2012)
-- HTTP: empty chunked POST ended up in two zero size chunks
+- cmdline: parse numerical options stricter
   
-  When doing a chunked-encoded POST with -d (CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS) and the
-  size of the POST was zero length, it made libcurl first send a zero
-  chunk and then the terminating one. This could confuse a receiver and it
-  should rather just send the terminating chunk as it does with this fix.
+  1 - str2offset() no longer accepts negative numbers since offsets are by
+  nature positive.
   
-  Test case 1333 is added to verify.
+  2 - introduced str2unum() for the command line parser that accepts
+  numericals which are not supposed to be negative, so that it will
+  properly complain on apparent bad uses and mistakes.

+Yang Tse (9 Jul 2012)
+- Make Curl_schannel_version() return "WinSSL"
   
-  The singleipconnect() function must not return an error if Curl_socket()
-  returns an error. It should then simply return OK and pass a SOCKET_BAD
-  back simply because that is how the user of this function expects it to
-  work and something else is not fine.

-- Take in account that CURLAUTH_* bitmasks are now 'unsigned long' - follow-up
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Jul 2012)
+- test 46: use different path lengths to get reliable sort order
   
-  MIPSPro compiler detected curl_easy_getinfo() related missing adjustments.
-  SunPro compiler detected curl tool --libcurl option related missing adjustments.
+  Since the order of the cookies is sorted by the length of the paths,
+  having them on the same path length will make the test depend on what

-- url.c: CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH and CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH fixes
+- cookie: fixed typo in comment
+
+- [Christian Hägele brought this change]
+
+  https_getsock: provided for schannel backend as well
   
-  Fail with CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN when none of requested auth methods is supported.
+  The function https_getsock was only implemented properly when USE_SSLEAY
+  or USE_GNUTLS is defined, but it is also necessary for USE_SCHANNEL.
   
-  Reject CURLAUTH_ONLY bit when given alone or with CURLAUTH_NONE.
+  The problem occurs when Curl_read_plain or Curl_write_plain returns
+  CURLE_AGAIN. In that case CURL_OK is returned to the multi-interface an
+  the used socket is set to state CURL_POLL_REMOVE and the easy-state is
+  set to CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT. This is fine, because later the socket
+  should be set to CURL_POLL_IN or CURL_POLL_OUT via multi_getsock. That's
+  where https_getsock is called and doesn't return any sockets.

-- -# progress meter: avoid superfluous updates and duplicate lines
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Jul 2012)
+- [Nick Zitzmann brought this change]
+
+  darwinssl: output cipher with text, remove SNI warning
   
-  By comparing if a different "progress point" is reached or not since the
-  previous update, the progress function callback for this now avoids many
-  superfluous screen updates. This has the nice side-effect that it fixes
-  a problem that causes a second progress meter line.
+  The code was printing a warning when SNI was set up successfully. Oops.
   
-  The second line output happened because when we use the -# progress
-  meter, we force a newline output after the transfer in the main loop in
-  curl, but when libcurl calls the progress callback from
-  curl_easy_cleanup() it would then output the progress display
-  again. Possibly the naive newline output is wrong but this optimization
-  was suitable anyway...
+  Printing the cipher number in verbose mode was something only TLS/SSL
+  programmers might understand, so I had it print the name of the cipher,
+  just like in the OpenSSL code. That'll be at least a little bit easier
+  to understand. The SecureTransport API doesn't have a method of getting
+  a string from a cipher like OpenSSL does, so I had to generate the
+  strings manually.

+  When doing CONNECT requests, libcurl must make sure the connection is

-  Compilation fix for old or unpatched versions of XL C compiler.

+  Reported by: Marcel Raad
 
-- headers: require GCC 2.7 or newer in order to allow attribute GCC'isms usage
+- sws: support <servercmd> for CONNECT requests
   
-  Usage in other code paths already protected and requiring even newer versions.
+  I moved out the servercmd parsing into a its own function called
+  parse_servercmd() and made sure it gets used also when the test number
+  is extracted from CONNECT requests. It turned out sws didn't do that
+  previously!
 
-- [Jonathan Nieder brought this change]
+- FILEFORMAT: provided a full description of connection-monitor
 
-  headers: surround GCC attribute names with double underscores
+- lib503: enable verbose to ease debugging this
+
+- sws: add 'connection-monitor' command support
   
-  This protects from attribute names being defined by third party's code.
+  Using this, the server will output in the protocol log when the
+  connection gets disconnected and thus we will verify correctly in the
+  test cases that the connection doesn't get closed prematurely. This is
+  important for example NTLM to work.
   
-  Improvement: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0127.html
+  Documentation added to FILEFORMAT, test 503 updated to use this.

+  curl: Restore noprogress and isatty config values.
   
-  If an empty string is passed to CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE, libcurl will
-  pass no public key to libssh2 which then tries to compute it from the
-  private key. This is known to work when libssh2 1.4.0+ is linked against
-  OpenSSL.
+  The noprogress and isatty in Configurable are global, in a sense
+  that they persist in one curl invocation. Currently once one
+  download writes its response data to tty, they are set to FALSE
+  and they are not restored on successive downloads.  This change
+  first backups the current noprogress and isatty, and restores
+  them when download does not write its data to tty.
 
 - [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]
 
-  OpenSSL: Made cert hostname check conform to RFC 6125
+  curl: Made --metalink option toggle Metalink functionality
   
-  This change replaces RFC 2818 based hostname check in OpenSSL build with
-  RFC 6125 [1] based one.
+  In this change, --metalink option no longer takes argument.  If
+  it is specified, given URIs are processed as Metalink XML file.
+  If given URIs are remote (e.g., http URI), curl downloads it
+  first. Regardless URI is local file (e.g., file URI scheme) or
+  remote, Metalink XML file is not written to local file system and
+  the received data is fed into Metalink XML parser directly.  This
+  means with --metalink option, filename related options like -O
+  and -o are ignored.
   
-  The hostname check in RFC 2818 is ambiguous and each project implements
-  it in the their own way and they are slightly different. I check curl,
-  gnutls, Firefox and Chrome and they are all different.
+  Usage examples:
   
-  I don't think there is a bug in current implementation of hostname
-  check. But it is not as strict as the modern browsers do. Currently,
-  curl allows multiple wildcard character '*' and it matches '.'. (as
-  described in the comment in ssluse.c).
+  $ curl --metalink http://example.org/foo.metalink
   
-  Firefox implementation is also based on RFC 2818 but it only allows at
-  most one wildcard character and it must be in the left-most label in the
-  pattern and the wildcard must not be followed by any character in the
-  label.[2] Chromium implementation is based on RFC 6125 as my patch does.
-  Firefox and Chromium both require wildcard in the left-most label in the
-  presented identifier.
+  This will download foo.metalink and parse it and then download
+  the URI described there.
   
-  This patch is more strict than the current implementation, so there may
-  be some cases where old curl works but new one does not. But at the same
-  time I think it is good practice to follow the modern browsers do and
-  follow the newer RFC.
+  $ curl --metalink file://foo.metalink
   
-  [1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section-6.4.3
-  [2] https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=159483

-- HTTP: reset expected DL/UL sizes on redirects

-  With FOLLOWLOCATION enabled. When a 3xx page is downloaded and the
-  download size was known (like with a Content-Length header), but the
-  subsequent URL (transfered after the 3xx page) was chunked encoded, then
-  the previous "known download size" would linger and cause the progress
-  meter to get incorrect information, ie the former value would remain
-  being sent in. This could easily result in downloads that were WAY
-  larger than "expected" and would cause >100% outputs with the curl
-  command line tool.
+  When creating metalink_checksum from metalink_checksum_t, first
+  check hex digest is valid for the given hash function.  We do
+  this check in the order of digest_aliases so that first good
+  match will be chosen (strongest hash function available).  As a
+  result, the metalinkfile now only contains at most one
+  metalink_checksum because other entries are just redundant.

-  Generate lists and use symbols in --libcurl code output.
-  
-  This patch improves the output of curl's --libcurl option by
-  generating code which builds curl_httppost and curl_slist lists, and
-  uses symbolic names for enum and flag values.  Variants of the
-  my_setopt macro in tool_setopt.h are added in order to pass extra type
-  information to the code-generation step in tool_setopt.c.
-  
-  If curl is configured with --disable-libcurl-option then the macros
-  call curl_easy_setopt directly.

-

-  pop3.c: Fixed drop of final CRLF in EOB checking
+  connect.c/ftp.c: Fixed dereferencing pointer breakin strict-aliasing
   
-  Curl_pop3_write() would drop the final CRLF of a message as it was
-  considered part of the EOB as opposed to part of the message. Whilst
-  the EOB sequence needs to be searched for by the function only the
-  final 3 characters should be removed as per RFC-1939 section 3.
+  Fixed warning: dereferencing pointer does break strict-aliasing rules
+  by using a union instead of separate pointer variables.
+  Internal union sockaddr_u could probably be moved to generic header.
+  Thanks to Paul Howarth for the hint about using unions for this.
   
-  Reported by: Rich Gray
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-02/0051.html
+  Important for winbuild: Separate declaration of sockaddr_u pointer.
+  The pointer variable *sock cannot be declared and initialized right
+  after the union declaration. Therefore it has to be a separate statement.

-  Explicitly link to the nettle/gcrypt libraries
+- pop3: Fixed an issue with changes introduced in commit c267c53017bc
   
-  When support for nettle was added in 64f328c787ab, I overlooked
-  the fact that AC_CHECK_LIB doesn't add the tested lib to LIBS
-  if the check succeeded, if a custom success code block was present.
-  (The previous version of the check had an empty block for
-  successful checks, adding the lib to LIBS implicitly.)
+  Because pop3_endofresp() is called for each line of data yet is not
+  passed the line and line length, so we have to use the data pointed to
+  by pp->linestart_resp which contains the whole packet, the mechanisms
+  were being detected in one call yet the function would be called for
+  each line of data.
   
-  Therefore, explicitly add either nettle or gcrypt to LIBS, after
-  deciding which one to use. Even if they can be linked in
-  transitively, it is safer to actually link explicitly to them.
+  Using curl with verbose mode enabled would show that one line of data
+  would be received in response to the AUTH command, before the AUTH
+  <mechanism> command was sent to the server and then the next few lines
+  of the original AUTH command would be displayed before the response from
+  the AUTH <mechanism> command. This would then cause problems when
+  parsing the CRAM-MD5 challenge data as extra data was contained in the
+  buffer.
   
-  This fixes building with gnutls with linkers that don't allow
-  linking transitively, such as for windows.
+  Changed the parsing so that each line is checked for the mechanisms
+  and the function returns FALSE until the whole of the AUTH response has
+  been processed.

-Version 7.24.0 (24 Jan 2012)
+- sasl: Moved ntlm authentication message handling from smtp.c
   
+  Moved the ntlm message creation and decoding from smtp.c into the sasl
+  module to allow for use by other modules such as pop3.
 
-Version 7.24.0 (24 Jan 2012)
-  Synced and prepared for 7.24.0 release. Two security problems, one bug fix,
+- pop3: Added support for sasl login authentication

-  two more contributors.
+Yang Tse (1 Jun 2012)
+- tests 1334 to 1345: several -O -J -i -D combinations with HTTP protocol
 
-- gnutls: enforced use of SSLv3
-  
-  With advice from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, changed the priority string to
-  add "actual priorities" and favour ARCFOUR. This makes libcurl work
-  better when enforcing SSLv3 with GnuTLS. Both in the sense that the
-  libmicrohttpd test is now working again but also that it mitigates a
-  weakness in the older SSL/TLS protocols.
+- tests: support test definitions with up to 5 file checks in <verify> section
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-01/0225.html
-  Reported by: Christian Grothoff
+  This is done introducing tags <file1> to <file4> besides existing <file> one,
+  as well as corresponding <stripfile1> to <stripfile4> ones, that can be used
+  in the <verify> section in the same way as the non-numbered ones.
 
-- tests: test CRLF in URLs
+Steve Holme (31 May 2012)
+- sasl: Moved login authentication message creation from smtp.c
   
-  Related to the security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036
+  Moved the login message creation from smtp.c into the sasl module
+  to allow for use by other modules such as pop3.
+
+- smtp.c: Reworked message encoding in smtp_state_authpasswd_resp()
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html
+  Rather than encoding the password message itself the
+  smtp_state_authpasswd_resp() function now delegates the work to the same
+  function that smtp_state_authlogin_resp() and smtp_authenticate() use
+  when constructing the encoded user name.
 
-- URL sanitize: reject URLs containing bad data
+- smtp.c: Re-factored smtp_auth_login_user() for use with passwords
   
-  Protocols (IMAP, POP3 and SMTP) that use the path part of a URL in a
-  decoded manner now use the new Curl_urldecode() function to reject URLs
-  with embedded control codes (anything that is or decodes to a byte value
-  less than 32).
+  In preparation for moving to the SASL module re-factored the
+  smtp_auth_login_user() function to smtp_auth_login() so that it can be
+  used for both user names and passwords as sending both of these under
+  the login authentication mechanism is the same.
+
+- pop3: Added support for sasl plain text authentication
+
+- curl_ntlm_msgs.c: Corrected small spelling mistake in comments
+
+- sasl: Moved plain text authentication message creation from smtp.c
   
-  URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and
-  allow users to do unintended actions with otherwise innocent tools and
-  applications. Like for example using a URL like
-  pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get
-  a mail and instead this would delete one.
+  Moved the plain text message creation from smtp.c into the sasl module
+  to allow for use by other modules such as pop3.
+
+Yang Tse (30 May 2012)
+- configure: fix LDAPS disabling related misplaced closing parenthesis
+
+- pop3 test server: allow pop3 test server verification to succeed again
   
-  This flaw is considered a security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036
+  Introduce SUPPORTCAPA and SUPPORTAUTH config commands to allow further
+  pop3 test server expansion for tests that require CAPA or AUTH support,
+  although this will need some extra work to make it fully functional.
+
+Steve Holme (28 May 2012)
+- pop3: Introduced the continue response in pop3_endofresp()
+
+- pop3: Changed response code from O and E to + and -
   
-  Security advisory at: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html
+  The POP3 protocol doesn't really have the concept of error codes and
+  uses +, +OK and -ERR in response to commands to indicate continue,
+  success and error.
   
-  Reported by: Dan Fandrich
+  The AUTH command is one of those commands that requires multiple pieces
+  of data to be sent to the server where the server will respond with + as
+  part of the handshaking. This meant changing the values before
+  continuing with the next stage of adding authentication support.
 
-- OpenSSL: don't disable security work-around
+- pop3: Small code tidy up following authentication work so far
   
-  OpenSSL added a work-around for a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability
-  (http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt). In 0.9.6e they added a bit
-  to SSL_OP_ALL that _disables_ that work-around despite the fact that
-  SSL_OP_ALL is documented to do "rather harmless" workarounds.
+  Changed the order of the state machine to match the order of actual
+  events.
   
-  The libcurl code uses the SSL_OP_ALL define and thus logically always
-  disables the OpenSSL fix.
+  Reworked some comments and function parameter positioning that I missed
+  the other day.
+
+Kamil Dudka (28 May 2012)
+- nss: use human-readable error messages provided by NSS
   
-  In order to keep the secure work-around workding, the
-  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit must not be set and this change
-  makes sure of this.
+  Bug: http://lists.baseurl.org/pipermail/yum-devel/2012-January/009002.html
+
+Daniel Stenberg (27 May 2012)
+- test1013.pl: filter out Metalink
   
-  Reported by: product-security at Apple
+  Since it isn't a feature supported by curl-config we can't compare that
+  with the --version output
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 6e2fd2c9ea
+- pop3: remove variable-not-used warnings
+
+Steve Holme (27 May 2012)
+- DOCS: Corrected the "Added in" version number for CURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH
   
-  3 more bugfixes, 3 more contributors
+  Additionally corrected another RFC link that I missed yesterday.
 
-- CURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS: spellfix
+- pop3: Added support for SASL based authentication mechanism detection
+  
+  Added support for detecting the supported SASL authentication mechanisms
+  via the AUTH command. There are two ways of detecting them, either by
+  using the AUTH command, that will return -ERR if not supported or by
+  using the CAPA command which will return SASL and the list of mechanisms
+  if supported, not include SASL if SASL authentication is not supported
+  or -ERR if the CAPA command is not supported. As such it seems simpler
+  to use the AUTH command and fallback to normal clear text authentication
+  if the the command is not supported.
+  
+  Additionally updated the test cases to return -ERR when the AUTH command
+  is encountered. Additional test cases will be added when support for the
+  individual authentication mechanisms is added.

-  Using a URL with embedded user name and password didn't work if the host
-  was given as a numerical IPv6 string, like ftp://user:password@[::1]/
+  Moved EOB definition into header file.
   
-  Reported by: Brandon Wang
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2012-01/0047.html
+  Switched the logic around in pop3_endofresp() to allow for the
+  introduction of auth-mechanism detection.

-  ... it is now named havege_random!
+  Metalink file contains several hash types of checksums, such as
+  md5, sha-1, sha-256, etc. To deal with these checksums, I created
+  abstraction layer based on lib/curl_md5.h and
+  lib/md5.c. Basically, they are almost the same but I changed the
+  code so that it is not hash type dependent. Currently,
+  GNUTLS(nettle or gcrypt) and OpenSSL functions are supported.
+  
+  Checksum checking is done by reopening download file.  If there
+  is an I/O error, the current implementation just prints error
+  message and does not try next resource.
   
-  Reported by: Robert Schumann
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-01/0178.html
+  In this patch, the supported hash types are: md5, sha-1 and sha-256.

+  Always create directory hierarchy for Metalink.
   
-  5 more bug fixes, 1 more contributor
+  Filenames contained in Metalink file can include directory information.
+  Filenames are unique in Metalink file, taking into account the directory
+  information. So we need to create the directory hierarchy.
+  
+  Curl has --create-dirs option, but we create directory hierarchy for
+  Metalink downloads regardless of the option value.
+  
+  This patch also put metalink int variable outside of HAVE_LIBMETALINK
+  guard. This reduces the number of #ifdefs.

-- curl.h: provide backwards compatible symbols
+  Made -D option work with -O and -J.
   
-  In commit c834213ad52 we re-used some obsolete error codes, and here are
-  two defines that makes sure existing source codes that happen to use any
-  of these deprecated ones will still compile.
-  
-  As usual, define CURL_NO_OLDIES to avoid getting these "precaution
-  defines".
-
-- win32-threaded-resolver: stop using a dummy socket
-  
-  Previously the code would create a dummy socket while resolving just to
-  have curl_multi_fdset() return something but the non-win32 version
-  doesn't do it this way and the creation and use of a socket that isn't
-  made with the common create-socket callback can be confusing to apps
-  using the multi_socket API etc.
+  To achieve this, first new structure HeaderData is defined to hold
+  necessary data to perform header-related work.  Then tool_header_cb now
+  receives HeaderData pointer as userdata.  All header-related work
+  (currently, dumping header and Content-Disposition inspection) are done
+  in this callback function.  HeaderData.outs->config is used to determine
+  whether each work is done.
   
-  This change removes the dummy socket and thus will cause
-  curl_multi_fdset() to return with maxfd == -1 more often.

-
-  OpenSSL: remove reference to openssl internal struct

-  The STARTTLS response code in SMTP, POP3 and IMAP would return

-  was not available on the server.
+  Due to the result code being reset to CURLE_OK when smtp_dophase_done()

-- test proxy supports CONNECT
-  
-  There's a new 'http-proxy' server for tests that runs on a separate port
-  and lets clients do HTTP CONNECT to other ports on the same host to
-  allow us to test HTTP "tunneling" properly.
+  Fixed compile error with GNUTLS+NETTLE
   
-  Test cases now have a <proxy> section in <verify> to check that the
-  proxy protocol part matches correctly.
+  In nettle/md5.h, md5_init and md5_update are defined as macros to
+  nettle_md5_init and nettle_md5_update respectively.  This causes
+  error when using MD5_params.md5_init and md5_update.  This patch
+  renames these members as md5_init_func and md5_update_func to
+  avoid name conflict. For completeness, MD5_params.md5_final was
+  also renamed as md5_final_func.
   
-  Test case 80, 83, 95, 275, 503 and 1078 have been converted. Test 1316
-  was added.

-- transfer: avoid unnecessary timeout event when waiting for 100-continue
+  Roman Mamedov spotted (in
+  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=670126) that curl would
+  not complain when given a URL with an IPv6 numerical address without
+  brackets. It would simply cut off the last ":[hex]" part and thus not
+  work correctly.
   
-  The commit 9dd85bc unintentionally changed the way we compute the time
-  spent waiting for 100-continue.  In particular, when using a SSL client
-  certificate, the time spent by SSL handshake was included and could
-  cause the CURL_TIMEOUT_EXPECT_100 timeout to be mistakenly fired up.
+  That's a URL using an illegal syntax and now libcurl will instead return
+  a clear error code and error message detailing the error.
   
-  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/767490
-  Reported by: Mamoru Tasaka
+  The above mentioned bug report claims this to be a regression but
+  libcurl does not guarantee functionality when given URLs that aren't
+  following the URL spec (RFC3986 mostly). I consider the fact that it
+  used to handle this differently a mere coincidence.

+- -# progress meter: avoid superfluous updates and duplicate lines
   
-  CURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS
+  By comparing if a different "progress point" is reached or not since the
+  previous update, the progress function callback for this now avoids many
+  superfluous screen updates. This has the nice side-effect that it fixes
+  a problem that causes a second progress meter line.
   
-  It sets the maximum amount of time FTP client is going to wait for a
-  server to connect. Internal default accept timeout is 60 seconds.
-
-- sockets: new Curl_socket_check() can wait for 3 sockets
+  The second line output happened because when we use the -# progress
+  meter, we force a newline output after the transfer in the main loop in
+  curl, but when libcurl calls the progress callback from
+  curl_easy_cleanup() it would then output the progress display
+  again. Possibly the naive newline output is wrong but this optimization
+  was suitable anyway...
   
-  This offers an alternative to the existing Curl_socket_ready() API which
-  only checks one socket for read and one for write.

-- buildconf: fix libtool 1.5.x warnings triggered with autoconf 2.6x or later
+  This change replaces RFC 2818 based hostname check in OpenSSL build with
+  RFC 6125 [1] based one.
   
-  Using libtool 1.5.x (x < 26) with autoconf 2.6x or later generates warnings
-  due to some libtool variables not following naming convention for variables
-  that will be cached.
+  The hostname check in RFC 2818 is ambiguous and each project implements
+  it in the their own way and they are slightly different. I check curl,
+  gnutls, Firefox and Chrome and they are all different.
   
-  This is addressed renaming a couple of variables to make these follow expected
-  naming convention.
+  I don't think there is a bug in current implementation of hostname
+  check. But it is not as strict as the modern browsers do. Currently,
+  curl allows multiple wildcard character '*' and it matches '.'. (as
+  described in the comment in ssluse.c).
+  
+  Firefox implementation is also based on RFC 2818 but it only allows at
+  most one wildcard character and it must be in the left-most label in the
+  pattern and the wildcard must not be followed by any character in the
+  label.[2] Chromium implementation is based on RFC 6125 as my patch does.
+  Firefox and Chromium both require wildcard in the left-most label in the
+  presented identifier.
+  
+  This patch is more strict than the current implementation, so there may
+  be some cases where old curl works but new one does not. But at the same
+  time I think it is good practice to follow the modern browsers do and
+  follow the newer RFC.

-- symbols.pl: provide LIBCURL_HAS macro for apps
-  
-  Experience has shown that the symbols-in-versions file is very useful to
-  applications that want to build with a wide range of libcurl versions.
-  It is however easy to get it wrong and the source gets a bit messy with
-  all the fixed numerical comparisions.

+  configure: check for gethostbyname in the watt lib
   
-  The point of this script is to provide an easy-to-use macro for libcurl-
-  using applications to do preprocessor checks for specific libcurl
-  defines, and yet make the code clearly show what the macro is used for.
+  This allows building of libcurl on DOS using DJGPP 2.04 and Watt-32
+  sockets. I know there's already Makefile.djgpp, but I find this more
+  convenient since I'm used to using the ./configure script from other
+  platforms

-  HTTP auth: fix proxy Negotiate bug
-  
-  If a proxy offers several Authentication schemes where NTLM and
-  Negotiate are offered by the proxy and you tell libcurl not to use the
-  Negotiate scheme then the request never returns when the proxy answers
-  with its HTTP 407 reply.
-  
-  It is reproducible by the following steps:
-  
-  - Use a proxy that offers NTLM and Negotiate ( CURLOPT_PROXY and
-  CURLOPT_PROXYPORT )
-  
-  - Tell libcurl NOT to use Negotiate CURL_EASY_SETOPT(CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH,
-  CURLAUTH_BASIC | CURLAUTH_DIGEST | CURLAUTH_NTLM )
-  
-  - Start the request
+- libcurl docs: version corrections
   
-  The call to CURL_EASY_PERFORM never returns. If you switch on debug
-  logging you can see that libcurl issues a new request As soon as it
-  received the 407 reply. Instead it should return and set the response
-  code to 407.

+  Fixed incorrect behavior in smtp_done() which would cause the end of
+  block data to be sent to the SMTP server if libcurl was operating in
+  connect only mode. This would cause the server to return an error as

-
-- FTP server: allow EPRT by default
+  9 bug fixes, 4 changes and numerous contributors
   
-  EPRT is now supported by default by the server. To disable it, use the
-  generic REPLY instruction in the <servercmd> tag. Test 116 now has it
-  disabled. All other existing active FTP port tests strip out the port
-  commands from the logs already so the change of the server isn't that

+- [Alessandro Ghedini brought this change]
+
+  curl tool: allow negative numbers as option values
   
-  As commit 5850cc4808ab clarifies, libcurl can deliver header lines that
-  are longer than CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE, only body data is limited to that
-  size. The curl tool has check (when built debug-enabled) that made the
-  wrong checks and this new test 1205 verifies that larger headers work.
+  Fix the str2num() function to not check if the input string starts with a
+  digit, since strtol() supports numbers prepended with '-' (and '+') too.
+  This makes the --max-redirs option work as documented.
 
-- curl_easy_setopt.3: headers can be CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER bytes
+- parse_proxy: simply memory handling
   
-  Mention this maximum header size for the header callback cases
+  ... by making sure that the string is always freed after the invoke as
+  parse_proxy will always copy the data and this way there's a single
+  free() instead of multiple ones.
 
-- Merge pull request #25 from trtom/master
+- parse_proxy: bail out on zero-length proxy names!
   
-  make sure the static build uses the static build option!
+  The proxy parser function strips off trailing slashes off the proxy name
+  which could lead to a mistaken zero length proxy name which would be
+  treated as no proxy at all by subsequent functions!
+  
+  This is now detected and an error is returned. Verified by the new test
+  1329.

-- tool_operate.c: OOM handling fix
+- --ssl-allow-beast added
   
-  Move curl_easy_perform source code geneartion out of curl_easy_perform's loop
-  for proper OOM handling and source code geneartion.
+  This new option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the
+  SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols. It uses the new libcurl option
+  CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS with the CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST bit set.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (21 Oct 2011)
-- curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
+- CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS: added
   
-  After a PORT has been issued, and the multi handle would switch to the
-  CURLM_STATE_DO_MORE state (which is unique for FTP), libcurl would
-  return the wrong fdset to wait for when curl_multi_fdset() is
-  called. The code would blindly assume that it was waiting for a connect
-  of the second connection, while that isn't true immediately after the
-  PORT command.
+  Allow an appliction to set libcurl specific SSL options. The first and
+  only options supported right now is CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST.
   
-  Also, the function multi.c:domore_getsock() was highly FTP-centric and
-  therefore ugly to keep in protocol-agnostic code. I solved this problem
-  by introducing a new function pointer in the Curl_handler struct called
-  domore_getsock() which is only called during the DOMORE state for
-  protocols that set that pointer.
+  It will make libcurl to disable any work-arounds the underlying SSL
+  library may have to address a known security flaw in the SSL3 and TLS1.0
+  protocol versions.
   
-  The new ftp.c:ftp_domore_getsock() function now returns fdset info about
-  the control connection's command/response handling while such a state is
-  in use, and goes over to waiting for a writable second connection first
-  once the commands are done.
+  This is a reaction to us unconditionally removing that behavior after
+  this security advisory:
   
-  The original problem could be seen by running test 525 and checking the
-  time stamps in the FTP server log. I can verify that this fix at least
-  fixes this problem.

+  ... it did however cause a lot of programs to fail because of old
+  servers not liking this work-around. Now programs can opt to decrease
+  the security in order to interoperate with old servers better.

+  Explicitly link to the nettle/gcrypt libraries
   
-  Fix a bug with with commit 2621dd42a4d that happened due to my last
-  second pre-commit cleanup of the change without proper testing
-  afterwards!
+  When support for nettle was added in 64f328c787ab, I overlooked
+  the fact that AC_CHECK_LIB doesn't add the tested lib to LIBS
+  if the check succeeded, if a custom success code block was present.
+  (The previous version of the check had an empty block for
+  successful checks, adding the lib to LIBS implicitly.)
+  
+  Therefore, explicitly add either nettle or gcrypt to LIBS, after
+  deciding which one to use. Even if they can be linked in
+  transitively, it is safer to actually link explicitly to them.
+  
+  This fixes building with gnutls with linkers that don't allow
+  linking transitively, such as for windows.

-  This return code has not been used since 7.20.0 so we can stop

+  When connecting to a domain with multiple IP addresses, allow different,
+  decreasing connection timeout values. This should guarantee some

+- gnutls: enforced use of SSLv3
   
-  Now, you can use them in any order and the result should still be the

-
-  typecheck: allow NULL to unset CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER
+  URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and

+  applications. Like for example using a URL like
+  pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get
+  a mail and instead this would delete one.
   
-  There might be situations where a user would want to unset this option.
-  Avoid forcing him/her to cast the NULL argument to (char *) in order to
-  get past the compile time typecheck.

-- sws.c: HTTP and GOPHER test server-side connection closing adjustment
+  OpenSSL added a work-around for a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability
+  (http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt). In 0.9.6e they added a bit
+  to SSL_OP_ALL that _disables_ that work-around despite the fact that
+  SSL_OP_ALL is documented to do "rather harmless" workarounds.
   
-  When, for a given test, server is instructed to close connection after
-  server reply we now wait a very small amount of time (50ms) before doing
-  so. This is done to allow client to, at least partially, read server
-  reply before getting an ECONNRESET.
+  The libcurl code uses the SSL_OP_ALL define and thus logically always
+  disables the OpenSSL fix.
   
-  The above is required to make test cases 1070, 1200, 1201 and 1202 pass
-  with Cygwin 1.5.X on W2K.
+  In order to keep the secure work-around workding, the
+  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit must not be set and this change
+  makes sure of this.
   
-  GOPHER test server closes connection after _every_ server-reply, as such,
-  at some point it could require a bigger time or using shutdown() before
-  a server-side initiated disconnection.

+- Curl_proxyCONNECT() trace known bug #39
 
-  smtp: Added support for NTLM authentication
-  
-  Modified smtp_endofresp() to detect NTLM from the server specified list
-  of supported authentication mechanisms.
-  
-  Modified smtp_authenticate() to start the sending of the NTLM data.
-  
-  Added smtp_auth_ntlm_type1_message() which creates a NTLM type-1
-  message. This function is used by authenticate() to start the sending
-  of data and by smtp_state_auth_ntlm_resp() when the AUTH command
-  doesn't contain the type-1 message as part of the initial response.
-  This lack of initial response can happen if an OOM error occurs or the
-  type-1 message is longer than 504 characters. As the main AUTH command
-  is limited to 512 character the data has to be transmitted in two
-  parts; one containing the AUTH NTLM and the second containing the
-  type-1 message.
-  
-  Added smtp_state_auth_ntlm_type2msg_resp() which handles the incoming
-  type-2 message and sends an outgoing type-3 message. This type-2
-  message is sent by the server in response to our type-1 message.

+  spec:
+  http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-http-status-308-02.html

-- Fix NTLM winbind support to pass the torture tests
+- ftpserver: output CRLF in logs
+  
+  Previously the log function would just filter out all CR and LF
+  occurances from the log to make it more readable. This had the downside
+  that it made it very hard to see CR LFs when they actually matters.
   
-  Calling sclose() both in the child and the parent fools the
-  socket leak detector into thinking it's been closed twice.
-  Calling close() in the child instead overcomes this problem. It's
-  not as portable as the sclose() macro, but this code is highly
-  POSIX-specific, anyway.
+  Now, they're instead converted to "[CR]" and "[LR]" in the log to become
+  apparent to readers.

-- MemoryTracking: fix logging of free() calls done where Curl_safefree is called
+- POP3: fix end of body detection
   
-  Just internal stuff...
+  Curl_pop3_write() now has a state machine that scans for the end of a
+  POP3 body so that the CR LF '.' CR LF sequence can come in everything
+  from one up to five subsequent packets.
   
-  Curl_safefree is now a macro defined in memdebug.h instead of a function
-  prototyped in url.h and implemented in url.c, so inclusion of url.h is no
-  longer required in order to simply use Curl_safefree.
+  Test case 810 is modified to use SLOWDOWN which makes the server pause
+  between each single byte and thus makes the POP3 body get sent to curl
+  basically one byte at a time.
+
+- test: added POP3 test with dot-prefixed line
   
-  Provide definition of macro WHILE_FALSE in setup_once.h in order to allow
-  other macros such as DEBUGF and DEBUGASSERT, and code using it, to compile
-  without 'conditional expression is constant' warnings.
+  Test 815 is disabled for now since libcurl currently doesn't unescape
+  such lines the way it should. See mail:

-  Fixed the order of the preferred SMTP authentication method to:

+  New gnutls versions have an error handler that knows about Winsock

-  AUTH PLAIN should be the last as it slightly more insecure than AUTH LOGIN
-  as the username and password are sent together - there is no handshaking

-  
-  Until 2011-08-17 libcurl's Memory Tracking feature also performed

-  values. Our own preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory
-  might be useful when not using third party memory debuggers, but

-  that all dynamically allocated memory is properly initialized.

-  As a default setting, libcurl's Memory Tracking feature no longer
-  performs preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory on its
-  own. If you know what you are doing, and really want to retain old

-  When building on Windows, with CMake and mingw, curl fails to compile
-  because the CMake build system is not properly looking for the Winsock

+  The call to CURL_EASY_PERFORM never returns. If you switch on debug

+- ssluse.c: fix calling of OpenSSL's ERR_remove_state(0)
+  
+  Move calling of ERR_remove_state(0) a.k.a ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL)
+  from Curl_ossl_close_all() to Curl_ossl_cleanup().
   
-  Curl_readrewind() was called without checking its return code, which
-  could lead to badness.
+  In this way ERR_remove_state(0) is now only called in libcurl by
+  curl_global_cleanup(). Previously it would get called by functions
+  curl_easy_cleanup(), curl_multi_cleanup and potentially each time a

+Daniel Stenberg (21 Oct 2011)
+- curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
+  
+  After a PORT has been issued, and the multi handle would switch to the
+  CURLM_STATE_DO_MORE state (which is unique for FTP), libcurl would
+  return the wrong fdset to wait for when curl_multi_fdset() is
+  called. The code would blindly assume that it was waiting for a connect
+  of the second connection, while that isn't true immediately after the
+  PORT command.
   
-  A proxy could be marked 'httpproxy' wrongly before if set with an
-  environment variable or with the CURLOPT_PROXY option with a socks*://
-  prefix or similar.
+  Also, the function multi.c:domore_getsock() was highly FTP-centric and
+  therefore ugly to keep in protocol-agnostic code. I solved this problem
+  by introducing a new function pointer in the Curl_handler struct called
+  domore_getsock() which is only called during the DOMORE state for
+  protocols that set that pointer.
   
-  Added test 710 to verify
+  The new ftp.c:ftp_domore_getsock() function now returns fdset info about
+  the control connection's command/response handling while such a state is
+  in use, and goes over to waiting for a writable second connection first
+  once the commands are done.

+- curl tool: adjust header callback single call write limit warning
   
-  Typecast when converting to int from long to avoid some compiler warnings
+  Maximum amount of data a header callback is supposed to get in
+  a single call from libcurl is limited by the lowest value of
+  CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE and CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER.

-  Shows we have a log way to go still...
+  When using Sun C compiler the preprocessor somehow inserts an extra space

-  When a time condition isn't met, so that no body is delivered to the

-  must close the connection to avoid a re-use of the connection to be
-  completely tricked.

-
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with b772f3a32146d7d

-Yang Tse (2 Jun 2011)
-- unit tests: attempt to fix linkage issue
+  When we use binary posts and regular ones intermixed on a single command
+  line, we cannot do strlen() etc on the data to figure out the length
+  (when inserting '&' and more). We must therefore keep track of the post
+  data length. Then we also end up setting the libcurl option with the
+  known size, so that we don't risk that libcurl will do strlen() on the
+  data.
+  
+  This has the minor side-effect that --libcurl source codes now always
+  will use CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE but I don't consider that terribly
+  damaging.

  curl_formadd() was made to fill in a public struct, but the fact that the

  but instead often restricts how the form functions can or can't be modified.

  curl_formadd() and curl_formget() both currently have no CURL handle
  argument, but both can use a callback that is set in the easy handle, and

  curl_easy_perform() (or similar) called - which is hard to grasp and a design
