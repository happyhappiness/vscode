+Version 7.16.1 (29 January 2007)
+
+Daniel (29 January 2007)
+- Michael Wallner reported that when doing a CONNECT with a custom User-Agent
+  header, you got _two_ User-Agent headers in the CONNECT request...! Added
+  test case 287 to verify the fix.
+
+Daniel (28 January 2007)
+- curl_easy_reset() now resets the CA bundle path correctly.
+
+- David McCreedy fixed the Curl command line tool for HTTP on non-ASCII
+  platforms.
+
+Daniel (25 January 2007)
+- Added the --libcurl [file] option to curl. Append this option to any
+  ordinary curl command line, and you will get a libcurl-using source code
+  written to the file that does the equivalent operation of what your command
+  line operation does!
+
+Dan F (24 January 2007)
+- Fixed a dangling pointer problem that prevented the http_proxy environment
+  variable from being properly used in many cases (and caused test case 63
+  to fail).
+
+Daniel (23 January 2007)
+- David McCreedy did NTLM changes mainly for non-ASCII platforms:
+
+  #1
+  There's a compilation error in http_ntlm.c if USE_NTLM2SESSION is NOT
+  defined.  I noticed this while testing various configurations.  Line 867 of
+  the current http_ntlm.c is a closing bracket for an if/else pair that only
+  gets compiled in if USE_NTLM2SESSION is defined.  But this closing bracket
+  wasn't in an #ifdef so the code fails to compile unless USE_NTLM2SESSION was
+  defined.  Lines 198 and 140 of my patch wraps that closing bracket in an
+  #ifdef USE_NTLM2SESSION.
+
+  #2
+  I noticed several picky compiler warnings when DEBUG_ME is defined.  I've
+  fixed them with casting.  By the way, DEBUG_ME was a huge help in
+  understanding this code.
+
+  #3
+  Hopefully the last non-ASCII conversion patch for libcurl in a while.  I
+  changed the "NTLMSSP" literal to hex since this signature must always be in
+  ASCII.
+
+  Conversion code was strategically added where necessary.  And the
+  Curl_base64_encode calls were changed so the binary "blobs" http_ntlm.c
+  creates are NOT translated on non-ASCII platforms.
+
+Dan F (22 January 2007)
+- Converted (most of) the test data files into genuine XML.  A handful still
+  are not, due mainly to the lack of support for XML character entities
+  (e.g. & => &amp; ).  This will make it easier to validate test files using
+  tools like xmllint, as well as to edit and view them using XML tools.
+
+Daniel (16 January 2007)
+- Armel Asselin improved libcurl to behave a lot better when an easy handle
+  doing an FTP transfer is removed from a multi handle before completion. The
+  fix also fixed the "alive counter" to be correct on "premature removal" for
+  all protocols.
+
+Dan F (16 January 2007)
+- Fixed a small memory leak in tftp uploads discovered by curl's memory leak
+  detector.  Also changed tftp downloads to URL-unescape the downloaded
+  file name.
+
+Daniel (14 January 2007)
+- David McCreedy provided libcurl changes for doing HTTP communication on
+  non-ASCII platforms. It does add some complexity, most notably with more
+  #ifdefs, but I want to see this supported added and I can't see how we can
+  add it without the extra stuff added.
+
+- Setting CURLOPT_COOKIELIST to "ALL" when no cookies at all was present,
+  libcurl would crash when trying to read a NULL pointer.
+
+Daniel (12 January 2007)
+- Toby Peterson found a nasty bug that prevented (lib)curl from properly
+  downloading (most) things that were larger than 4GB on 32 bit systems.  Matt
+  Witherspoon helped as narrow down the problem.
+
+Daniel (5 January 2007)
+- Linus Nielsen Feltzing introduced the --ftp-ssl-ccc command line option to
+  curl that uses the new CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC option in libcurl. If enabled, it
+  will make libcurl shutdown SSL/TLS after the authentication is done on a
+  FTP-SSL operation.
+
+Daniel (4 January 2007)
+- David McCreedy made changes to allow base64 encoding/decoding to work on
+  non-ASCII platforms.
+
+Daniel (3 January 2007)
+- Matt Witherspoon fixed the flaw which made libcurl 7.16.0 always store
+  downloaded data in two buffers, just to be able to deal with a special HTTP
+  pipelining case. That is now only activated for pipelined transfers. In
+  Matt's case, it showed as a considerable performance difference,
+
+Daniel (2 January 2007)
+- Victor Snezhko helped us fix bug report #1603712
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1603712) (known bug #36) --limit-rate
+  (CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE and CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE) are broken
+  on Windows (since 7.16.0, but that's when they were introduced as previous
+  to that the limiting logic was made in the application only and not in the
+  library). It was actually also broken on select()-based systems (as apposed
+  to poll()) but we haven't had any such reports. We now use select(), Sleep()
+  or delay() properly to sleep a while without waiting for anything input or
+  output when the rate limiting is activated with the easy interface.
+
+- Modified libcurl.pc.in to use Libs.private for the libs libcurl itself needs
+  to get built static. It has been mentioned before and was again brought to
+  our attention by Nathanael Nerode who filed debian bug report #405226
+  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=405226).
+
+Daniel (29 December 2006)
+- Make curl_easy_duphandle() set the magic number in the new handle.
+
+Daniel (22 December 2006)
+- Robert Foreman provided a prime example snippet showing how libcurl would
+  get confused and not acknowledge the 'no_proxy' variable properly once it
+  had used the proxy and you re-used the same easy handle. I made sure the
+  proxy name is properly stored in the connect struct rather than the
+  sessionhandle/easy struct.
+
+- David McCreedy fixed a bad call to getsockname() that wrongly used a size_t
+  variable to point to when it should be a socklen_t.
+
+- When setting a proxy with environment variables and (for example) running
+  'curl [URL]' with a URL without a protocol prefix, curl would not send a
+  correct request as it failed to add the protocol prefix.
+
+Daniel (21 December 2006)
+- Robson Braga Araujo reported bug #1618359
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1618359) and subsequently provided a
+  patch for it: when downloading 2 zero byte files in a row, curl 7.16.0
+  enters an infinite loop, while curl 7.16.1-20061218 does one additional
+  unnecessary request.
+
+  Fix: During the "Major overhaul introducing http pipelining support and
+  shared connection cache within the multi handle." change, headerbytecount
+  was moved to live in the Curl_transfer_keeper structure. But that structure
+  is reset in the Transfer method, losing the information that we had about
+  the header size. This patch moves it back to the connectdata struct.
+
+Daniel (16 December 2006)
+- Brendan Jurd provided a fix that now prevents libcurl from getting a SIGPIPE
+  during certain conditions when GnuTLS is used.
+
+Daniel (11 December 2006)
+- Alexey Simak found out that when doing FTP with the multi interface and
+  something went wrong like it got a bad response code back from the server,
+  libcurl would leak memory. Added test case 538 to verify the fix.
+
+  I also noted that the connection would get cached in that case, which
+  doesn't make sense since it cannot be re-use when the authentication has
+  failed. I fixed that issue too at the same time, and also that the path
+  would be "remembered" in vain for cases where the connection was about to
+  get closed.
+
+Daniel (6 December 2006)
+- Sebastien Willemijns reported bug #1603712
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1603712) which is about connections
+  getting cut off prematurely when --limit-rate is used. While I found no such
+  problems in my tests nor in my reading of the code, I found that the
+  --limit-rate code was severly flawed (since it was moved into the lib, since
+  7.15.5) when used with the easy interface and it didn't work as documented
+  so I reworked it somewhat and now it works for my tests.
+
+Daniel (5 December 2006)
+- Stefan Krause pointed out a compiler warning with a picky MSCV compiler when
+  passing a curl_off_t argument to the Curl_read_rewind() function which takes
+  an size_t argument. Curl_read_rewind() also had debug code left in it and it
+  was put in a different source file with no good reason when only used from
+  one single spot.
+
+- Sh Diao reported that CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY doesn't work, and indeed, there is
+  no code present in the library that receives the option. Since it was not
+  possible to use, we know that no current users exist and thus we simply
+  removed it from the docs and made the code always use the default path of
+  the code.
+
+- Jared Lundell filed bug report #1604956
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1604956) which identified setting
+  CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS to zero caused libcurl to SIGSEGV. Starting now, libcurl
+  will always internally use no less than 1 entry in the connection cache.
+
+- Sh Diao reported that CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE no works, and indeed it broke in
+  the 7.16.0 release.
+
+- Martin Skinner brought back bug report #1230118 to haunt us once again.
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1230118) curl_getdate() did not work
+  properly for all input dates on Windows. It was mostly seen on some TZ time
+  zones using DST. Luckily, Martin also provided a fix.
+
+- Alexey Simak filed bug report #1600447
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1600447) in which he noted that active
+  FTP connections don't work with the multi interface. The problem is here
+  that the multi interface state machine has a state during which it can wait
+  for the data connection to connect, but the active connection is not done in
+  the same step in the sequence as the passive one is so it doesn't quite work
+  for active. The active FTP code still use a blocking function to allow the
+  remote server to connect.
+
+  The fix (work-around is a better word) for this problem is to set the
+  boolean prematurely that the data connection is completed, so that the "wait
+  for connect" phase ends at once.
+
+  The proper fix, left for the future, is of course to make the active FTP
+  case to act in a non-blocking way too.
+
+- Matt Witherspoon fixed a problem case when the CPU load went to 100% when a
+  HTTP upload was disconnected:
+
+  "What appears to be happening is that my system (Linux 2.6.17 and 2.6.13) is
+  setting *only* POLLHUP on poll() when the conditions in my previous mail
+  occur. As you can see, select.c:Curl_select() does not check for POLLHUP. So
+  basically what was happening, is poll() was returning immediately (with
+  POLLHUP set), but when Curl_select() looked at the bits, neither POLLERR or
+  POLLOUT was set. This still caused Curl_readwrite() to be called, which
+  quickly returned. Then the transfer() loop kept continuing at full speed
+  forever."
+
+Daniel (1 December 2006)
+- Toon Verwaest reported that there are servers that send the Content-Range:
+  header in a third, not suppported by libcurl, format and we agreed that we
+  could make the parser more forgiving to accept all the three found
+  variations.
+
+Daniel (25 November 2006)
+- Venkat Akella found out that libcurl did not like HTTP responses that simply
+  responded with a single status line and no headers nor body. Starting now, a
+  HTTP response on a persistent connection (i.e not set to be closed after the
+  response has been taken care of) must have Content-Length or chunked
+  encoding set, or libcurl will simply assume that there is no body.
+
+  To my horror I learned that we had no less than 57(!) test cases that did bad
+  HTTP responses like this, and even the test http server (sws) responded badly
+  when queried by the test system if it is the test system. So although the
+  actual fix for the problem was tiny, going through all the newly failing test
+  cases got really painful and boring.
+
+Daniel (24 November 2006)
+- James Housley did lots of work and introduced SFTP downloads.
+
+Daniel (13 November 2006)
+- Ron in bug #1595348 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1595348) pointed
+  out a stack overwrite (and the corresponding fix) on 64bit Windows when
+  dealing with HTTP chunked encoding.
+
+Daniel (9 November 2006)
+- Nir Soffer updated libcurl.framework.make:
+  o fix symlinks, should link to Versions, not to ./Versions
+  o indentation improvments
+
+- Dmitriy Sergeyev found a SIGSEGV with his test04.c example posted on 7 Nov
+  2006. It turned out we wrongly assumed that the connection cache was present
+  when tearing down a connection.
+
+- Ciprian Badescu found a SIGSEGV when doing multiple TFTP transfers using the
+  multi interface, but I could also repeat it doing multiple sequential ones
+  with the easy interface. Using Ciprian's test case, I could fix it.
+
+Daniel (8 November 2006)
+- Bradford Bruce reported that when setting CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION without
+  CURLOPT_VERBOSE set to non-zero, you still got a few debug messages from the
+  SSL handshake. This is now stopped.
+
+Daniel (7 November 2006)
+- Olaf fixed a leftover problem with the CONNECT fix of his that would leave a
+  wrong error message in the error message buffer.
+
+Daniel (3 November 2006)
+- Olaf Stueben provided a patch that I edited slightly. It fixes the notorious
+  KNOWN_BUGS #25, which happens when a proxy closes the connection when
+  libcurl has sent CONNECT, as part of an authentication negotiation. Starting
+  now, libcurl will re-connect accordingly and continue the authentication as
+  it should.
+
+Daniel (2 November 2006)
+- James Housley brought support for SCP transfers, based on the libssh2 library
+  for the actual network protocol stuff.
+
+  Added these new curl_easy_setopt() options:
+
+    CURLOPT_SSH_AUTH_TYPES
+    CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE
+    CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE
+
 Version 7.16.0 (30 October 2006)
 
 Daniel (25 October 2006)
 - Fixed CURLOPT_FAILONERROR to return CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR even for the
   case when 401 or 407 are returned, *IF* no auth credentials have been given.
   The CURLOPT_FAILONERROR option is not possible to make fool-proof for 401

 Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify
 it using the \fI--url\fP option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own

+This option can be used multiple times to load multiple config files.

 resort the '%USERPROFILE%\Application Data'.
 
 2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one
 in the same dir the executable curl is placed. On unix-like systems, it will
 simply try to load .curlrc from the determined home dir.
+.IP "--libcurl <file>"
+Append this option to any ordinary curl command line, and you will get a
+libcurl-using source code written to the file that does the equivalent
+operation of what your command line operation does!
+
+If this option is used several times, the last given file name will be used.
 .IP "--limit-rate <speed>"
 Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use. This feature is useful
 if you have a limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not use your entire
 bandwidth.
 
 The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is appended.
 Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilobytes, 'm' or M' makes it
 megabytes while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.
 
+The given rate is the average speed, counted during the entire transfer. It
+means that curl might use higher transfer speeds in short bursts, but over
+time it uses no more than the given rate.
+
 If you are also using the \fI-Y/--speed-limit\fP option, that option will take
 precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping the
 speed-limit logic working.
 
 If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

-  libcurl 7.11.1 builds with c-ares 1.1.0, but 7.11.2 and later require c-ares
-  1.2.0 or alter.
+  The latest libcurl version requires c-ares 1.3.2 or later to work
+  flawlessly.
 
   Once upon the time libcurl built fine with the "original" ares. That is no
-  longer true. You need to use c-ares. c-ares is based on ares but improved.
+  longer true. You need to use c-ares.
 
 Build c-ares
 ============
 
 1. unpack the c-ares archive
 2. cd c-ares-dir

- o curl_multi_socket() and the LOW_SPEED options
- o curl_multi_socket() expire timer during c-ares name resolves
- o curl_multi_add_handle on an already added handle now fails gracefully
- o multi interface crash if bad function call order was used for cleanup
- o put a new URL in saved cookie jar files
- o configure --with-gssapi-libs
- o SOCKS proxy connection fixes

- o proxy URL with user name and empty password or no password at all now work
- o fixed a socket state problem with *multi_socket()
- o (HTTP) NTLM hostname fix
- o getsockname usage fixes
- o SOCKS5 proxy connects can now time-out
- o SOCKS5 connects that require auth no longer segfaults when auth not given
- o multi interface using asynch resolves could get stuck in wrong state
- o the 'running_handles' counter wasn't always updated properly when
-   curl_multi_remove_handle() was used
- o (FTP) EPRT transfers with IPv6 didn't work properly
- o (FTP) SINGLECWD mode and using files in the root dir
- o (HTTP) Expect: header disabling work better
- o (HTTP) "Expect: 100-continue" disable on second POST on re-used connection
- o src/config.h.in is fixed
- o (HTTP) POST data logged to the debug callback function is now correctly
-   tagged as data, not header
+ o proxy close during CONNECT authentication is now dealt with nicely
+ o the CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION was sometimes called even when CURLOPT_VERBOSE
+   was not enabled
+ o multiple TFTP transfers on the same (easy or multi) handle could cause a
+   crash
+ o SIGSEGV when disconnecting on a transfer on a re-used handle when the
+   host name didn't resolve
+ o stack overwrite on 64bit Windows in the chunked decoding department
+ o HTTP responses on persistent connections without Content-Length nor chunked
+   encoding are now considered to be without response body
+ o Content-Range: header parsing improved
+ o CPU 100% load when HTTP upload connection broke
+ o active FTP didn't work with multi interface
+ o curl_getdate() could be off one hour for TZ time zones with DST, on windows
+ o CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE works again
+ o CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS set to zero caused libcurl to SIGSEGV
+ o rate limiting works better
+ o getting FTP response code errors when using the multi-interface caused
+   libcurl to leak memory
+ o no more SIGPIPE when GnuTLS is used
+ o FTP downloading 2 zero byte files in a row
+ o using proxy and URLs without protocol prefixes
+ o first using a proxy and then accessing a site that 'no_proxy' matched,
+   would still make libcurl use the proxy...
+ o curl_easy_duphandle() now makes a handle that is valid for the multi
+   interface since the magic number is set fine
+ o libcurl.pc now uses Libs.private for "private" libs
+ o --limit-rate (CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE and CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE)
+   now work on windows again
+ o improved download performance by avoiding the unconditional "double copying"
+ o base64 encoding/decoding works on non-ASCII platforms
+ o large file downloads
+ o CURLOPT_COOKIELIST set to "ALL" crash
+ o easy handle removal from multi handle before completion
+ o TFTP upload memory leak
+ o curl_easy_reset() now resets the CA bundle path correctly
+ o two User-Agent headers in CONNECT requests with custom User-Agent
+
