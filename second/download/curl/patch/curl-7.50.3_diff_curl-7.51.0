+- generate.bat: Include include/curl in libcurl VS projects
   
-  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20160914.html
+  .. because including those headers helps Visual Studio's Intellisense.
 
-- curl: make --create-dirs on windows grok both forward and backward slashes
+- generate.bat: Remove strcase.[ch] from curl tool VS projects
   
-  Reported-by: Ryan Scott
+  ..because they're no longer needed in the tool build. strcase is still
+  built by the libcurl project and exports curl_str(n)equal which is used
+  by the curl tool.

+- file: fix compiler warning
+  
+  follow-up to 46133aa5
 
-  mbedtls: switch off NTLM in build if md4 isn't available
+Dan Fandrich (1 Nov 2016)
+- strcase: fixed Metalink builds by redefining checkprefix()
   
-  NTLM support with mbedTLS was added in 497e7c9 but requires that mbedTLS
-  is built with the MD4 functions available, which it isn't in default
-  builds. This now adapts if the funtion isn't there and builds libcurl
-  without NTLM support if so.
+  ...to use the public function curl_strnequal(). This isn't ideal because
+  it adds extra overhead to any internal calls to checkprefix.
   
-  Fixes #1004
+  follow-up to 95bd2b3e
 
-Jay Satiro (12 Sep 2016)
-- CODE_STYLE: fix long-line guideline
-  
-  - Change maximum allowed line length from 80 to 79.
+Daniel Stenberg (1 Nov 2016)
+- curl.1: typo
 
-- CODE_STYLE: add column alignment section
+- curl.1: expand on how multiple uses of -o looks
   
-  Note that since the added examples are for column alignment I had to
-  encapsulate with ~~~c markdown to preserve their alignment.
+  Suggested-by: Dan Jacobson
+  Issue: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/1097
 
-Peter Wu (11 Sep 2016)
-- cmake: fix curl-config --static-libs
-  
-  The `curl-config --static-libs` command should not output paths like
-  -l/usr/lib/libssl.so, instead print the absolute path without `-l`.
-  
-  This also removes the confusing message "Static linking is broken" which
-  was printed because curl-config --static-libs was disfunctional even
-  though the static libcurl.a library works properly.
+- tests/util: get a private strncasecompare clone
   
-  Fixes https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/841
+  ... since the curlx_* code no longer provides one and we don't link
+  libcurl to these test servers.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (11 Sep 2016)
-- http: refuse to pass on response body with NO_NODY was set
+- strcase: make the tool use curl_str[n]equal instead
   
-  ... like when a HTTP/0.9 response comes back without any headers at all
-  and just a body this now prevents that body from being sent to the
-  callback etc.
+  As they are after all part of the public API. Saves space and reduces
+  complexity. Remove the strcase defines from the curlx_ family.
   
-  Adapted test 1144 to verify.

-  Fixes #973
+  follow-up to 811a693b80
+
+Dan Fandrich (31 Oct 2016)
+- strcasecompare: include curl.h in strcase.c
   
-  Assisted-by: Ray Satiro
+  This should fix the "warning: 'curl_strequal' redeclared without
+  dllimport attribute: previous dllimport ignored" message and subsequent
+  link error on Windows because of the missing CURL_EXTERN on the
+  prototype.

+- strcase: fix the remaining rawstr users
 
-Jakub Zakrzewski (10 Sep 2016)
-- CMake: Don't build unit tests if private symbols are hidden
-  
-  This only excludes building unit tests from default build ( 'all' Make
-  target or "Build Solution" in VisualStudio). The projects and Make
-  targets will still be generated and shown in supporting IDEs.
-  
-  Fixes https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/981
-  Reported-by: Randy Armstrong
+- msvc builds: s/rawstr/strcase
   
-  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/990
+  Follow-up to 811a693b
 
-- CMake: Try to (un-)hide private library symbols
+Dan Fandrich (31 Oct 2016)
+- strcasecompare: replaced remaining rawstr.h with strcase.h
   
-  Detect support for compiler symbol visibility flags and apply those
-  according to CURL_HIDDEN_SYMBOLS option.
-  It should work true to the autotools build except it tries to unhide
-  symbols on Windows when requested and prints warning if it fails.
+  This is a followup to commit 811a693b
+
+Marcel Raad (31 Oct 2016)
+- digest_sspi: fix include

-Daniel Stenberg (9 Sep 2016)
-- openssl: fix bad memory free (regression)
+Dan Fandrich (31 Oct 2016)
+- libauthretry: use the external function curl_strequal
   
-  ... by partially reverting f975f06033b1. The allocation could be made by
-  OpenSSL so the free must be made with OPENSSL_free() to avoid problems.
+  The internal version strcasecompare isn't available outside libcurl
+
+Daniel Stenberg (31 Oct 2016)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with d14538d2501ef0da
+
+- configure: raise the default minimum version for macos to 10.8
   
-  Reported-by: Harold Stuart
-  Fixes #1005
+  follow-up to 4f8d0b6f02aa7043. Since the darwinssl code breaks
+  otherwise. If you build without darwinssl 10.5 works fine.
 
-- http2: support > 64bit sized uploads
+- unit1301: keep testing curl_strequal
   
-  ... by making sure we don't count down the "upload left" counter when the
-  uploaded size is unknown and then it can be allowed to continue forever.
+  as that is still part of the API, fix from 8fe4bd084412f30
+
+- ldap: fix include
   
-  Fixes #996
+  Fix bug from 811a693b80
 
-Jay Satiro (7 Sep 2016)
-- errors: new alias CURLE_WEIRD_SERVER_REPLY (8)
+- url: remove unconditional idn2.h include
   
-  Since we're using CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_SERVER_REPLY in imap, pop3 and smtp as
-  more of a generic "failed to parse" introduce an alias without FTP in
-  the name.
+  Mistake brought by 9c91ec778104a
+
+- curl_strequal: part of public API/ABI, needs to be kept
   
-  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/975
+  These two public functions have been mentioned as deprecated since a
+  very long time but since they are still part of the API and ABI we need
+  to keep them around.

-GitHub (7 Sep 2016)
-- [Viktor Szakats brought this change]
+- strcasecompare: all case insensitive string compares ignore locale now
+  
+  We had some confusions on when each function was used. We should not act
+  differently on different locales anyway.
 
-  mk-ca-bundle.pl: use SHA256 instead of SHA1
+- strcasecompare: is the new name for strequal()
   
-  This hash is used to verify the original downloaded certificate bundle
-  and also included in the generated bundle's comment header. Also
-  rename related internal symbols to algorithm-agnostic names.
+  ... to make it less likely that we forget that the function actually
+  does case insentive compares. Also replaced several invokes of the
+  function with a plain strcmp when case sensitivity is not an issue (like
+  comparing with "-").
 
-Version 7.50.2 (7 Sep 2016)
+- ftp: check for previous patch must be case sensitive!
+  
+  ... otherwise example.com/PATH and example.com/path would be assumed to
+  be the same and they usually aren't!

+  CVE-2016-8617
+  
+  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102C.html
+  Reported-by: Cure53
 
-  openssl: fix CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT
+- krb5: avoid realloc(0)
   
-  CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT does not get the certificate verification
-  result when SSL_connect fails because of a certificate verification
-  error.
+  If the requested size is zero, bail out with error instead of doing a
+  realloc() that would cause a double-free: realloc(0) acts as a free()
+  and then there's a second free in the cleanup path.
   
-  This fix saves the result of SSL_get_verify_result so that it is
-  returned by CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT.
+  CVE-2016-8619

+- aprintf: detect wrap-around when growing allocation
   
-  While noErr and errSecSuccess are defined as the same value, the API
-  documentation states that SecPKCS12Import() returns errSecSuccess if
-  there were no errors in importing. Ensure that a future change of the

-- [Olivier Brunel brought this change]
+- test1246: verify URL parsing with host name ending with '#'
 
-  speed caps: not based on average speeds anymore
-  
-  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
-  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
-  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
-  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
-  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
-  bursts" (as told in man page).
+- urlparse: accept '#' as end of host name
   
-  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
-  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
-  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
-  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
-  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
-  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
+  'http://example.com#@127.0.0.1/x.txt' equals a request to example.com
+  for the '/' document with the rest of the URL being a fragment.
   
-  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
-  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
-  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
-  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
-  case of sudden speed burst).

+  
+  This is a follow-up to d2c6d15 which switched mk-ca-bundle.vbs output to

-  - Disable ALPN on Wine.
+  - Change URL retrieval to HTTPS-only by default.
   
-  - Don't pass input secbuffer when ALPN is disabled.
+  - Comment out the options that disabled SSL cert checking by default.
   
-  When ALPN support was added a change was made to pass an input secbuffer
-  to initialize the context. When ALPN is enabled the buffer contains the
-  ALPN information, and when it's disabled the buffer is empty. In either
-  case this input buffer caused problems with Wine and connections would
-  not complete.
+  - Assume OpenSSL is present, get SHA256. And add a flag to toggle it.

-  Serialise the call to PK11_FindSlotByName() to avoid spurious errors in

-  in nssSlot_IsTokenPresent().
+  The cert issuer output is now ansi, converted from UTF-8. Prior to this

+- KNOWN_BUGS: two more existing problems
 
-  ftp: fix wrong poll on the secondary socket
+Marcel Raad (16 Oct 2016)
+- win: fix Universal Windows Platform build
   
-  When we're uploading using FTP and the server issues a tiny pause
-  between opening the connection to the client's secondary socket, the
-  client's initial poll() times out, which leads to second poll() which
-  does not wait for POLLIN on the secondary socket. So that poll() also
-  has to time out, creating a long (200ms) pause.
+  This fixes a merge error in commit 7f3df80 caused by commit 332e8d6.
   
-  This patch adds the correct flag to the secondary socket, making the
-  second poll() correctly wait for the connection there too.
+  Additionally, this changes Curl_verify_windows_version for Windows App
+  builds to assume to always be running on the target Windows version.
+  There seems to be no way to determine the Windows version from a
+  UWP app. Neither GetVersion(Ex), nor VerifyVersionInfo, nor the
+  Version Helper functions are supported.

-  curl: allow "pkcs11:" prefix for client certificates
+  cookies: same domain handling changed to match browser behavior
   
-  RFC7512 provides a standard method to reference certificates in PKCS#11
-  tokens, by means of a URI starting 'pkcs11:'.
+  Cokie with the same domain but different tailmatching property are now
+  considered different and do not replace each other.  If header contains
+  following lines then two cookies will be set: Set-Cookie: foo=bar;
+  domain=.foo.com; expires=Thu Mar 3 GMT 8:56:27 2033 Set-Cookie: foo=baz;
+  domain=foo.com; expires=Thu Mar 3 GMT 8:56:27 2033
   
-  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
-  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
-  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
-  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.
+  This matches Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox behavior. When sending
+  stored tokens to foo.com Chrome, Opera, Firefox store send them in the

+- New libcurl option to keep sending on error
   
-  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
-  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
-  differences for different applications.
+  Add the new option CURLOPT_KEEP_SENDING_ON_ERROR to control whether
+  sending the request body shall be completed when the server responds
+  early with an error status code.
   
-  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
-  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
-  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
-  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
-  the URI itself.
+  This is suitable for manual NTLM authentication.
   
-  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
-  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
-  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
-  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
+  Reviewed-by: Jay Satiro
   
-  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
-  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
-  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
-  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

-- proxy: reject attempts to use unsupported proxy schemes
+  libressl: fix version output
   
-  I discovered some people have been using "https://example.com" style
-  strings as proxy and it "works" (curl doesn't complain) because curl
-  ignores unknown schemes and then assumes plain HTTP instead.
+  LibreSSL defines `OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER` as `0x20000000L` for all
+  versions returning `LibreSSL/2.0.0` for any LibreSSL version.
   
-  I think this misleads users into believing curl uses HTTPS to proxies
-  when it doesn't. Now curl rejects proxy strings using unsupported
-  schemes instead of just ignoring and defaulting to HTTP.

-- CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY: now enabled by default
+Jakub Zakrzewski (10 Sep 2016)
+- CMake: Don't build unit tests if private symbols are hidden
   
-  After a few wasted hours hunting down the reason for slowness during a
-  TLS handshake that turned out to be because of TCP_NODELAY not being
-  set, I think we have enough motivation to toggle the default for this
-  option. We now enable TCP_NODELAY by default and allow applications to
-  switch it off.
+  This only excludes building unit tests from default build ( 'all' Make
+  target or "Build Solution" in VisualStudio). The projects and Make
+  targets will still be generated and shown in supporting IDEs.
   
-  This also makes --tcp-nodelay unnecessary, but --no-tcp-nodelay can be
-  used to disable it.

+- [Olivier Brunel brought this change]
+
+  speed caps: not based on average speeds anymore
   
-  Didn't work.
+  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
+  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
+  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
+  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
+  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
+  bursts" (as told in man page).
   
-  This reverts commit 50723585ed380744358de054e2a55dccee65dfd7.
-
-- travis: Install libtool for OS X builds
+  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
+  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
+  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
+  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
+  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
+  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
   
-  CI is failing due to missing libtoolize, so I'm trying this.
+  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
+  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
+  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
+  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
+  case of sudden speed burst).
+  
+  Closes #971

+  As Windows SSPI authentication calls fail when a particular mechanism

+  to query support for a supported mechanism before selecting it.
   
-  The old way was not intuitive and probably not something users expected.
-  When a user disables session ID caching I'd guess they don't expect the
-  session ID to be cached anyway in case the caching is later enabled.
+  For now each function returns TRUE to maintain compatability with the
+  existing code when called.

-- curl-compilers.m4: improve detection of GCC's -fvisibility= flag

-  Some builds of GCC produce output on both stdout and stderr when --help
-  --verbose is used.  The 2>&1 redirection caused them to be arbitrarily
-  interleaved with each other because of stream buffering.  Consequently,

-- tests: fix the HTTP/2 tests

-  The HTTP/2 tests brought with commit bf05606ef1f were using the internal
-  name 'http2' for the HTTP/2 server, while in fact that name was already
-  used for the second instance of the HTTP server. This made tests using
-  the second instance (like test 2050) fail after a HTTP/2 test had run.
+  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
+  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
+  differences for different applications.
   
-  The server is now known as HTTP/2 internally and within the <server>
-  section in test cases. 1700, 1701 and 1702 were updated accordingly.

-- curl.1: missed 'T' in the progress unit suffixes
+  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
+  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
+  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
+  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
+  the URI itself.
+  
+  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
+  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
+  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
+  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
+  
+  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
+  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
+  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
+  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

-  vtls: fix ssl session cache race condition
-  
-  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
-  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
-  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
-  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
-  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
-  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
-  This commit:
-   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
-     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
-   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
-     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
-   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
-     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
-     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
-     this race.

+  mbedtls: set debug threshold to 4 (verbose) when MBEDTLS_DEBUG is defined
+  
+  In order to make MBEDTLS_DEBUG work, the debug threshold must be unequal
+  to 0.  This patch also adds a comment how mbedtls must be compiled in
+  order to make debugging work, and explains the possible debug levels.
 
-  loadlibrary: Only load system DLLs from the system directory
+- CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY: now enabled by default
   
-  Inspiration provided by: Daniel Stenberg and Ray Satiro
+  After a few wasted hours hunting down the reason for slowness during a
+  TLS handshake that turned out to be because of TCP_NODELAY not being
+  set, I think we have enough motivation to toggle the default for this
+  option. We now enable TCP_NODELAY by default and allow applications to
+  switch it off.
   
-  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20160530.html
+  This also makes --tcp-nodelay unnecessary, but --no-tcp-nodelay can be
+  used to disable it.

-- smtp: minor ident (white space) fixes
+  Previously, passing a timeout of zero to Curl_expire() was a magic code

+  and will trigger a timeout ASAP.

-  http2: Add space between colon and header value
-  
-  curl's representation of HTTP/2 responses involves transforming the
-  response to a format that is similar to HTTP/1.1. Prior to this change,
-  curl would do this by separating header names and values with only a
-  colon, without introducing a space after the colon.
-  
-  While this is technically a valid way to represent a HTTP/1.1 header
-  block, it is much more common to see a space following the colon. This
-  change introduces that space, to ensure that incautious tools are safely
-  able to parse the header block.

-  adjustment 0dc4d8e was made to account for schemeless URLs however it's

+  vtls: fix ssl session cache race condition
+  
+  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
+  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
+  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
+  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
+  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
+  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
+  This commit:
+   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
+     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
+   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
+     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
+   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
+     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
+     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
+     this race.

-  sendf.c: added ability to call recv() before send() as workaround
-  
-  WinSock destroys recv() buffer if send() is failed. As result - server
-  response may be lost if server sent it while curl is still sending
-  request. This behavior noticeable on HTTP server short replies if
-  libcurl use several send() for request (usually for POST request).

-  keeps received data in intermediate buffer for further processing.

-  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
-  
-  This commit ensures that streams which was closed in on_stream_close
-  callback gets passed to http2_handle_stream_close.  Previously, this
-  might not happen.  To achieve this, we increment drain property to
-  forcibly call recv function for that stream.
-  
-  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
-  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into
-  http_conn.drain_total.  We only shutdown session if that value is 0.
+  schannel: fix compile break with MSVC XP toolset
   
-  With this commit, when stream was closed before reading response
-  header fields, error code CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM is returned even if
-  HTTP/2 level error is NO_ERROR.  This signals the upper layer that
-  stream was closed by error just like TCP connection close in HTTP/1.
+  For the Windows XP toolset of Visual C++ 2013/2015, the old Windows SDK
+  7.1 is used. In this case, _USING_V110_SDK71_ is defined.

-  curl.1: change example for -F
+  http2: Add space between colon and header value
   
-  It's a bad idea to send your passwords anywhere, especially over HTTP.
-  Modified example to send a picture instead.
+  curl's representation of HTTP/2 responses involves transforming the
+  response to a format that is similar to HTTP/1.1. Prior to this change,
+  curl would do this by separating header names and values with only a
+  colon, without introducing a space after the colon.
   
-  Fixes #752
-
-- KNOWN_BUGS: reorganized and cleaned up
+  While this is technically a valid way to represent a HTTP/1.1 header
+  block, it is much more common to see a space following the colon. This
+  change introduces that space, to ensure that incautious tools are safely
+  able to parse the header block.
   
-  Now sorted into categories and organized in the same style we do the
-  TODO document. It will make each issue linked properly on the
-  https://curl.haxx.se/docs/knownbugs.html web page.
+  This also ensures that the difference between the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
+  response layout is as minimal as possible.
   
-  The sections should make it easier to find issues and issues related to
-  areas of the reader's specific interest.

+  Calling SSL_peek can cause bytes to be read from the raw socket which in

+  available on the socket.
   
-  Reported-by: Michael Osipov
+  Since Curl_ossl_check_cxn only tries to determine whether the socket is
+  alive and doesn't actually need to see the bytes SSL_peek seems like
+  the wrong function to call.
+  
+  We're able to occasionally reproduce a connect timeout due to this
+  bug. What happens is that Curl doesn't know to call SSL_connect again
+  after the peek happens since data is buffered in the SSL buffer and thus
+  select won't fire for this socket.

+- lib: include curl_printf.h as one of the last headers
   
-  Although this should never happen due to the relationship between the

-  it does cause problems for code analysis tools:
+  curl_printf.h defines printf to curl_mprintf, etc. This can cause
+  problems with external headers which may use
+  __attribute__((format(printf, ...))) markers etc.
   
-  V595 The 'mech' pointer was utilized before it was verified against
-       nullptr. Check lines: 376, 381. curl_sasl.c 376
+  To avoid that they cause problems with system includes, we include
+  curl_printf.h after any system headers. That makes the three last
+  headers to always be, and we keep them in this order:

-  the credentials were NULL rather than when the challenge message was
-  populated.
+  Mostly because they're not needed, because memdebug.h is always included

-  This also brings this part of the Kerberos 5 code in line with the

-  It was only really used by libcurl internals but was mostly erased from

-  
-  As a side-effect, making sure _MPRINTF_REPLACE is gone and not used, I
-  made the lib tests in tests/libtest/ use curl_printf.h for its redefine
-  magic and then subsequently the use of sprintf() got banned in the tests
-  as well (as it is in libcurl internals) and I then replaced them all
-  with snprintf().
-  
-  In the unlikely event that any users is actually using this define and

-- Revert "sshserver: remove use of AuthorizedKeysFile2"
+  This commit ensures that streams which was closed in on_stream_close
+  callback gets passed to http2_handle_stream_close.  Previously, this
+  might not happen.  To achieve this, we increment drain property to
+  forcibly call recv function for that stream.
   
-  It seems we may have some autobuild problems after this commit went
-  in. Trying to see if a revert helps to get them back.
+  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
+  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into
+  http_conn.drain_total.  We only shutdown session if that value is 0.

-  warning C4189: 'data': local variable is initialized but not referenced
+  Previously, when a stream was closed with other than NGHTTP2_NO_ERROR
+  by RST_STREAM, underlying TCP connection was dropped.  This is
+  undesirable since there may be other streams multiplexed and they are
+  very much fine.  This change introduce new error code
+  CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM, which indicates stream error that only affects the
+  relevant stream, and connection should be kept open.  The existing
+  CURLE_HTTP2 means connection error in general.
   
-  ...and some minor formatting/spacing changes.

-  libcurl previously had a more liberal approach which causes significant

-  
-  The previous logic read all n/v pairs from left-to-right and the first

-  cookie name, thus accepting "Set-Cookie: Max-Age=2; person=daniel" to be

-  openssl: remove most BoringSSL #ifdefs.
-  
-  As of https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/#/c/6980/, almost all of
-  BoringSSL #ifdefs in cURL should be unnecessary:
-  
-  - BoringSSL provides no-op stubs for compatibility which replaces most
-    #ifdefs.
-  
-  - DES_set_odd_parity has been in BoringSSL for nearly a year now. Remove
-    the compatibility codepath.
-  
-  - With a small tweak to an extend_key_56_to_64 call, the NTLM code
-    builds fine.
-  
-  - Switch OCSP-related #ifdefs to the more generally useful
-    OPENSSL_NO_OCSP.
-  
-  The only #ifdefs which remain are Curl_ossl_version and the #undefs to
-  work around OpenSSL and wincrypt.h name conflicts. (BoringSSL leaves
-  that to the consumer. The in-header workaround makes things sensitive to
-  include order.)
+  schannel: Add ALPN support
   
-  This change errs on the side of removing conditionals despite many of
-  the restored codepaths being no-ops. (BoringSSL generally adds no-op
-  compatibility stubs when possible. OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER #ifdefs are
-  bad enough!)
+  Add ALPN support for schannel. This allows cURL to negotiate
+  HTTP/2.0 connections when built with schannel.

+- configure: use cpp -P when needed
   
-  - New flags to modify sanitize behavior:
+  Since gcc 5, the processor output can get split up on multiple lines

+  definitions. The fix is to use cpp -P, and this fix now first checks if
+  cpp -P is necessary and then if cpp -P works before it uses that to
+  extract defined values.

-  Prior to this commit sanitization of a user-specified outfile was
-  temporarily disabled in 2b6dadc because there was no way to allow path
-  separators and colons through while replacing other banned characters.
-  Now in such a case we call the sanitize function with
-  SANITIZE_ALLOW_PATH which allows path separators and colons to pass
-  through.
+  Introduced in commit ca5f9341ef this happens because a char*, which is
+  32-bits wide in 32-bit land, is being cast to a curl_off_t which is
+  64-bits wide where 64-bit integers are supported by the compiler.
   
+  This doesn't happen in 64-bit land as a pointer is the same size as a
+  curl_off_t.
   
-  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/624
-  Reported-by: Octavio Schroeder
+  This fix doesn't address the fact that a 64-bit value cannot be used
+  for CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN when set in a form array and compiled on a
+  32-bit platforms, it does at least suppress the compilation warning.

-  NTLM: Fix ConnectionExists to compare Proxy credentials
+- ftp: remove a check for NULL(!)
   
-  Proxy NTLM authentication should compare credentials when
-  re-using a connection similar to host authentication, as it
-  authenticate the connection.
+  ... as it implies we need to check for that on all the other variable
+  references as well (as Coverity otherwise warns us for missing NULL
+  checks), and we're alredy making sure that the pointer is never NULL.
+
+- cookies: first n/v pair in Set-Cookie: is the cookie, then parameters
   
-  Example:
-  curl -v -x http://proxy:port http://host/ -U good_user:good_pwd
-    --proxy-ntlm --next -x http://proxy:port http://host/
-      [-U fake_user:fake_pwd --proxy-ntlm]
+  RFC 6265 section 4.1.1 spells out that the first name/value pair in the
+  header is the actual cookie name and content, while the following are
+  the parameters.
   
-  CVE-2016-0755
+  libcurl previously had a more liberal approach which causes significant
+  problems when introducing new cookie parameters, like the suggested new
+  cookie priority draft.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20160127A.html
+  The previous logic read all n/v pairs from left-to-right and the first
+  name used that wassn't a known parameter name would be used as the
+  cookie name, thus accepting "Set-Cookie: Max-Age=2; person=daniel" to be
+  a cookie named 'person' while an RFC 6265 compliant parser should
+  consider that to be a cookie named 'Max-Age' with an (unknown) parameter
+  'person'.

-  curl: avoid local drive traversal when saving file (Windows)

+- curl_multi_wait: never return -1 in 'numfds'

-  http2: Support trailer fields
-  
-  This commit adds trailer support in HTTP/2.  In HTTP/1.1, chunked
-  encoding must be used to send trialer fields.  HTTP/2 deprecated any
-  trandfer-encoding, including chunked.  But trailer fields are now
-  always available.
-  
-  Since trailer fields are relatively rare these days (gRPC uses them
-  extensively though), allocating buffer for trailer fields is done when
-  we detect that HEADERS frame containing trailer fields is started.  We
-  use Curl_add_buffer_* functions to buffer all trailers, just like we
-  do for regular header fields.  And then deliver them when stream is
-  closed.  We have to be careful here so that all data are delivered to
-  upper layer before sending trailers to the application.
-  
-  We can deliver trailer field one by one using NGHTTP2_ERR_PAUSE
-  mechanism, but current method is far more simple.
+  configure: --with-ca-fallback: use built-in TLS CA fallback
   
-  Another possibility is use chunked encoding internally for HTTP/2
-  traffic.  I have not tested it, but it could add another overhead.
+  When trying to verify a peer without having any root CA certificates
+  set, this makes libcurl use the TLS library's built in default as
+  fallback.

-- RELEASE-NOTES: Adjusted for the recent OAuth 2.0 activity
-
-- tests: Disabled 889 and 890 until we support POP3 continuation responses
+  - Switch from verifying a pinned public key in a callback during the
+  certificate verification to inline after the certificate verification.
   
-  As POP3 final and continuation responses both begin with a + character,
-  and both the finalcode and contcode variables in SASLprotoc are set as
-  such, we cannot tell the difference between them when we are expecting
-  an optional continuation from the server such as the following:
+  The callback method had three problems:
   
-  + something else from the server
-  +OK final response
+  1. If a pinned public key didn't match, CURLE_SSL_PINNEDPUBKEYNOTMATCH
+  was not returned.
   
-  Disabled these tests until such a time we can tell the responses apart.
-
-- tests: Corrected typos from commit ba4d8f7eba
-
-- tests: Added OAUTHBEARER failure response tests
-
-- oauth2: Support OAUTHBEARER failures sent as continuation responses
+  2. If peer certificate verification was disabled the pinned key
+  verification did not take place as it should.
   
-  According to RFC7628 a failure message may be sent by the server in a
-  base64 encoded JSON string as a continuation response.
+  3. (related to #2) If there was no certificate of depth 0 the callback
+  would not have checked the pinned public key.
   
-  Currently only implemented for OAUTHBEARER and not XAUTH2.

-- oauth2: Added support for OAUTHBEARER SASL mechanism to IMAP, POP3 and SNMP
+  Though all those problems could have been fixed it would have made the
+  code more complex. Instead we now verify inline after the certificate
+  verification in mbedtls_connect_step2.
   
-  OAUTHBEARER is now the official "registered" SASL mechanism name for
-  OAuth 2.0. However, we don't want to drop support for XOAUTH2 as some

                                 How To Compile
 
-Installing Binary Packages
-==========================
-
-   Lots of people download binary distributions of curl and libcurl. This
-   document does not describe how to install curl or libcurl using such a
-   binary package. This document describes how to compile, build and install
-   curl and libcurl from source code.
-
-Building from git
-=================
-
-   If you get your code off a git repository, see the GIT-INFO file in the
-   root directory for specific instructions on how to proceed.
-
-Unix
-====
-
-   A normal Unix installation is made in three or four steps (after you've
-   unpacked the source archive):
-
-        ./configure
-        make
-        make test (optional)
-        make install
-
-   You probably need to be root when doing the last command.
-
-   If you have checked out the sources from the git repository, read the
-   GIT-INFO on how to proceed.
-
-   Get a full listing of all available configure options by invoking it like:
-
-        ./configure --help
-
-   If you want to install curl in a different file hierarchy than /usr/local,
-   you need to specify that already when running configure:
-
-        ./configure --prefix=/path/to/curl/tree
-
-   If you happen to have write permission in that directory, you can do 'make
-   install' without being root. An example of this would be to make a local
-   install in your own home directory:
-
-        ./configure --prefix=$HOME
-        make
-        make install
-
-   The configure script always tries to find a working SSL library unless
-   explicitly told not to. If you have OpenSSL installed in the default search
-   path for your compiler/linker, you don't need to do anything special. If
-   you have OpenSSL installed in /usr/local/ssl, you can run configure like:
-
-        ./configure --with-ssl
-
-   If you have OpenSSL installed somewhere else (for example, /opt/OpenSSL)
-   and you have pkg-config installed, set the pkg-config path first, like this:
-
-        env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/OpenSSL/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --with-ssl
-
-   Without pkg-config installed, use this:
-
-        ./configure --with-ssl=/opt/OpenSSL
-
-   If you insist on forcing a build without SSL support, even though you may
-   have OpenSSL installed in your system, you can run configure like this:
-
-        ./configure --without-ssl
-
-   If you have OpenSSL installed, but with the libraries in one place and the
-   header files somewhere else, you have to set the LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS
-   environment variables prior to running configure.  Something like this
-   should work:
-
-     (with the Bourne shell and its clones):
-
-        CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/ssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/ssl/lib" \
-           ./configure
-
-     (with csh, tcsh and their clones):
-
-        env CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/ssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/ssl/lib" \
-           ./configure
-
-   If you have shared SSL libs installed in a directory where your run-time
-   linker doesn't find them (which usually causes configure failures), you can
-   provide the -R option to ld on some operating systems to set a hard-coded
-   path to the run-time linker:
-
-        env LDFLAGS=-R/usr/local/ssl/lib ./configure --with-ssl
-
-   MORE OPTIONS
-   ------------
-
-     To force configure to use the standard cc compiler if both cc and gcc are
-     present, run configure like
-
-       CC=cc ./configure
-         or
-       env CC=cc ./configure
-
-     To force a static library compile, disable the shared library creation
-     by running configure like:
-
-       ./configure --disable-shared
-
-     To tell the configure script to skip searching for thread-safe functions,
-     add an option like:
-
-       ./configure --disable-thread
-
-     If you're a curl developer and use gcc, you might want to enable more
-     debug options with the --enable-debug option.
-
-     curl can be built to use a whole range of libraries to provide various
-     useful services, and configure will try to auto-detect a decent
-     default. But if you want to alter it, you can select how to deal with
-     each individual library.
-
-     To build with GnuTLS for SSL/TLS, use both --without-ssl and
-     --with-gnutls.
-
-     To build with Cyassl for SSL/TLS, use both --without-ssl and
-     --with-cyassl.
-
-     To build with NSS for SSL/TLS, use both --without-ssl and --with-nss.
-
-     To build with PolarSSL for SSL/TLS, use both --without-ssl and
-     --with-polarssl.
-
-     To build with axTLS for SSL/TLS, use both --without-ssl and --with-axtls.
-
-     To build with GSS-API support, use --with-gssapi and have the MIT Kerberos
-     or Heimdal packages installed.
-
-     To get support for SCP and SFTP, build with --with-libssh2 and have
-     libssh2 0.16 or later installed.
-
-     To get Metalink support, build with --with-libmetalink and have the
-     libmetalink packages installed.
-
-   SPECIAL CASES
-   -------------
-
-   Some versions of uClibc require configuring with CPPFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE=1
-   to get correct large file support.
-
-   The Open Watcom C compiler on Linux requires configuring with the variables:
-
-       ./configure CC=owcc AR="$WATCOM/binl/wlib" AR_FLAGS=-q \
-           RANLIB=/bin/true STRIP="$WATCOM/binl/wstrip" CFLAGS=-Wextra

-
-   Building Windows DLLs and C run-time (CRT) linkage issues
-   ---------------------------------------------------------
-
-   As a general rule, building a DLL with static CRT linkage is highly
-   discouraged, and intermixing CRTs in the same app is something to
-   avoid at any cost.
-
-   Reading and comprehension of Microsoft Knowledge Base articles
-   KB94248 and KB140584 is a must for any Windows developer. Especially
-   important is full understanding if you are not going to follow the
-   advice given above.
-
-   KB94248  - How To Use the C Run-Time
-              https://support.microsoft.com/kb/94248/en-us
-
-   KB140584 - How to link with the correct C Run-Time (CRT) library
-              https://support.microsoft.com/kb/140584/en-us
-
-   KB190799 - Potential Errors Passing CRT Objects Across DLL Boundaries
-              https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235460
-
-   If your app is misbehaving in some strange way, or it is suffering
-   from memory corruption, before asking for further help, please try
-   first to rebuild every single library your app uses as well as your
-   app using the debug multithreaded dynamic C runtime.
-
-   If you get linkage errors read section 5.7 of the FAQ document.
-
-   MingW32
-   -------
-
-   Make sure that MinGW32's bin dir is in the search path, for example:
-
-     set PATH=c:\mingw32\bin;%PATH%
-
-   then run 'mingw32-make mingw32' in the root dir. There are other
-   make targets available to build libcurl with more features, use:
-   'mingw32-make mingw32-zlib' to build with Zlib support;
-   'mingw32-make mingw32-ssl-zlib' to build with SSL and Zlib enabled;
-   'mingw32-make mingw32-ssh2-ssl-zlib' to build with SSH2, SSL, Zlib;
-   'mingw32-make mingw32-ssh2-ssl-sspi-zlib' to build with SSH2, SSL, Zlib
-   and SSPI support.
-
-   If you have any problems linking libraries or finding header files, be sure
-   to verify that the provided "Makefile.m32" files use the proper paths, and
-   adjust as necessary. It is also possible to override these paths with
-   environment variables, for example:
-
-     set ZLIB_PATH=c:\zlib-1.2.8
-     set OPENSSL_PATH=c:\openssl-1.0.2c
-     set LIBSSH2_PATH=c:\libssh2-1.6.0
-
-   ATTENTION: if you want to build with libssh2 support you have to use latest
-   version 0.17 - previous versions will NOT work with 7.17.0 and later!
-   Use 'mingw32-make mingw32-ssh2-ssl-zlib' to build with SSH2 and SSL enabled.
-
-   It is now also possible to build with other LDAP SDKs than MS LDAP;
-   currently it is possible to build with native Win32 OpenLDAP, or with the
-   Novell CLDAP SDK. If you want to use these you need to set these vars:

-     set LDAP_SDK=c:\openldap
-     set USE_LDAP_OPENLDAP=1
-
-   or for using the Novell SDK:
-
-     set USE_LDAP_NOVELL=1
-
-   If you want to enable LDAPS support then set LDAPS=1.
-
-   - optional MingW32-built OpenLDAP SDK available from:

-   Cygwin
-   ------
-
-   Almost identical to the unix installation. Run the configure script in the
-   curl root with 'sh configure'. Make sure you have the sh executable in
-   /bin/ or you'll see the configure fail toward the end.
-
-   Run 'make'

-
-   MSVC 6 caveats
-   --------------
-
-   If you use MSVC 6 it is required that you use the February 2003 edition of
-   the 'Platform SDK' which can be downloaded from:
-
-   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=12261
-
-   Building any software with MSVC 6 without having PSDK installed is just
-   asking for trouble down the road once you have released it, you might notice
-   the problems in the first corner or ten miles ahead, depending mostly on your
-   choice of static vs dynamic runtime and third party libraries. Anyone using
-   software built in such way will at some point regret having done so.
-
-   If the compiler has been updated with the installation of a service pack as
-   those mentioned in https://support.microsoft.com/kb/194022 the compiler can be
-   safely used to read source code, translate and make it object code.
-
-   But, even with the service packs mentioned above installed, the resulting
-   software generated in such an environment will be using outdated system
-   header files and libraries with bugs and security issues which have already
-   been addressed and fixed long time ago.
-
-   So, building curl and libcurl with MSVC 6 without PSDK is absolutely
-   discouraged for the benefit of anyone using software built in such
-   environment. And it will not be supported in any way, as we could just
-   be hunting bugs which have already been fixed way back in 2003.
-
-   When building with MSVC 6 we attempt to detect if PSDK is not being used,
-   and if this is the case the build process will fail hard with an error
-   message stating that the February 2003 PSDK is required. This is done to
-   protect the unsuspecting and avoid PEBKAC issues.
-
-   Additionally it might happen that a die hard MSVC hacker still wants to
-   build curl and libcurl with MSVC 6 without PSDK installed, even knowing
-   that this is a highly discouraged and unsupported build environment. In
-   this case the brave of heart will be able to build in such an environment
-   with the requisite of defining preprocessor symbol ALLOW_MSVC6_WITHOUT_PSDK
-   in lib/config-win32.h and knowing that LDAP and IPv6 support will be missing.
-
-   MSVC from command line
-   ----------------------
-
-   Run the 'vcvars32.bat' file to get a proper environment. The
-   vcvars32.bat file is part of the Microsoft development environment and
-   you may find it in 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\vc98\bin'
-   provided that you installed Visual C/C++ 6 in the default directory.
-
-   Then run 'nmake vc' in curl's root directory.
-
-   If you want to compile with zlib support, you will need to build
-   zlib (http://www.zlib.net/) as well. Please read the zlib
-   documentation on how to compile zlib. Define the ZLIB_PATH environment
-   variable to the location of zlib.h and zlib.lib, for example:
-
-     set ZLIB_PATH=c:\zlib-1.2.8
-
-   Then run 'nmake vc-zlib' in curl's root directory.
-
-   If you want to compile with SSL support you need the OpenSSL package.
-   Please read the OpenSSL documentation on how to compile and install
-   the OpenSSL libraries.  The build process of OpenSSL generates the
-   libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll files in the out32dll subdirectory in
-   the OpenSSL home directory.  OpenSSL static libraries (libeay32.lib,
-   ssleay32.lib, RSAglue.lib) are created in the out32 subdirectory.
-
-   Before running nmake define the OPENSSL_PATH environment variable with
-   the root/base directory of OpenSSL, for example:
-
-     set OPENSSL_PATH=c:\openssl-0.9.8zc
-
-   Then run 'nmake vc-ssl' or 'nmake vc-ssl-dll' in curl's root
-   directory.  'nmake vc-ssl' will create a libcurl static and dynamic
-   libraries in the lib subdirectory, as well as a statically linked
-   version of curl.exe in the src subdirectory.  This statically linked
-   version is a standalone executable not requiring any DLL at
-   runtime. This make method requires that you have the static OpenSSL
-   libraries available in OpenSSL's out32 subdirectory.
-   'nmake vc-ssl-dll' creates the libcurl dynamic library and
-   links curl.exe against libcurl and OpenSSL dynamically.
-   This executable requires libcurl.dll and the OpenSSL DLLs
-   at runtime.
-   Run 'nmake vc-ssl-zlib' to build with both ssl and zlib support.
-
-   MSVC IDE
-   --------
-
-   A fairly comprehensive set of Visual Studio project files are available for
-   v6.0 through v12.0 and are located in the projects folder to allow proper
-   building of both the libcurl library as well as the curl tool.
-
-   For more information about these projects and building via Visual Studio
-   please see the README file located in the projects folder.
-
-   Borland C++ compiler
-   --------------------
-
-   Ensure that your build environment is properly set up to use the compiler
-   and associated tools. PATH environment variable must include the path to
-   bin subdirectory of your compiler installation, eg: c:\Borland\BCC55\bin
-
-   It is advisable to set environment variable BCCDIR to the base path of
-   the compiler installation.
-
-     set BCCDIR=c:\Borland\BCC55
-
-   In order to build a plain vanilla version of curl and libcurl run the
-   following command from curl's root directory:
-
-     make borland
-
-   To build curl and libcurl with zlib and OpenSSL support set environment
-   variables ZLIB_PATH and OPENSSL_PATH to the base subdirectories of the
-   already built zlib and OpenSSL libraries and from curl's root directory
-   run command:
-
-     make borland-ssl-zlib
-
-   libcurl library will be built in 'lib' subdirectory while curl tool
-   is built in 'src' subdirectory. In order to use libcurl library it is
-   advisable to modify compiler's configuration file bcc32.cfg located
-   in c:\Borland\BCC55\bin to reflect the location of libraries include
-   paths for example the '-I' line could result in something like:
-
-     -I"c:\Borland\BCC55\include;c:\curl\include;c:\openssl\inc32"
-
-   bcc3.cfg '-L' line could also be modified to reflect the location of
-   of libcurl library resulting for example:
-
-     -L"c:\Borland\BCC55\lib;c:\curl\lib;c:\openssl\out32"
-
-   In order to build sample program 'simple.c' from the docs\examples
-   subdirectory run following command from mentioned subdirectory:
-
-     bcc32 simple.c libcurl.lib cw32mt.lib
-
-   In order to build sample program simplessl.c an SSL enabled libcurl
-   is required, as well as the OpenSSL libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib
-   libraries.
-
-   OTHER MSVC IDEs
-   ---------------
-
-   If you use VC++, Borland or similar compilers. Include all lib source
-   files in a static lib "project" (all .c and .h files that is).
-   (you should name it libcurl or similar)
-
-   Make the sources in the src/ drawer be a "win32 console application"
-   project. Name it curl.
-
-   Disabling Specific Protocols in Win32 builds
-   --------------------------------------------
-
-   The configure utility, unfortunately, is not available for the Windows
-   environment, therefore, you cannot use the various disable-protocol
-   options of the configure utility on this platform.
-
-   However, you can use the following defines to disable specific
-   protocols:
-
-   HTTP_ONLY             disables all protocols except HTTP
-   CURL_DISABLE_FTP      disables FTP
-   CURL_DISABLE_LDAP     disables LDAP
-   CURL_DISABLE_TELNET   disables TELNET
-   CURL_DISABLE_DICT     disables DICT
-   CURL_DISABLE_FILE     disables FILE
-   CURL_DISABLE_TFTP     disables TFTP
-   CURL_DISABLE_HTTP     disables HTTP
-   CURL_DISABLE_IMAP     disables IMAP
-   CURL_DISABLE_POP3     disables POP3
-   CURL_DISABLE_SMTP     disables SMTP
-
-   If you want to set any of these defines you have the following options:
-
-   - Modify lib/config-win32.h
-   - Modify lib/curl_setup.h
-   - Modify lib/Makefile.vc6
-   - Modify the "Preprocessor Definitions" in the libcurl project
-
-   Note: The pre-processor settings can be found using the Visual Studio IDE
-   under "Project -> Settings -> C/C++ -> General" in VC6 and "Project ->
-   Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor" in later
-   versions.
-
-   Using BSD-style lwIP instead of Winsock TCP/IP stack in Win32 builds
-   --------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-   In order to compile libcurl and curl using BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack
-   it is necessary to make definition of preprocessor symbol USE_LWIPSOCK
-   visible to libcurl and curl compilation processes. To set this definition
-   you have the following alternatives:
-
-   - Modify lib/config-win32.h and src/config-win32.h
-   - Modify lib/Makefile.vc6
-   - Modify the "Preprocessor Definitions" in the libcurl project
-
-   Note: The pre-processor settings can be found using the Visual Studio IDE
-   under "Project -> Settings -> C/C++ -> General" in VC6 and "Project ->
-   Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor" in later
-   versions.
-
-   Once that libcurl has been built with BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack support,
-   in order to use it with your program it is mandatory that your program
-   includes lwIP header file <lwip/opt.h> (or another lwIP header that includes
-   this) before including any libcurl header. Your program does not need the
-   USE_LWIPSOCK preprocessor definition which is for libcurl internals only.
-
-   Compilation has been verified with lwIP 1.4.0 and contrib-1.4.0 from:
-
-   http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lwip/lwip-1.4.0.zip
-   http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lwip/contrib-1.4.0.zip
-
-   This BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack support must be considered experimental
-   given that it has been verified that lwIP 1.4.0 still needs some polish,
-   and libcurl might yet need some additional adjustment, caveat emptor.
-
-   Important static libcurl usage note
-   -----------------------------------
-
-   When building an application that uses the static libcurl library, you must
-   add '-DCURL_STATICLIB' to your CFLAGS.  Otherwise the linker will look for
-   dynamic import symbols.
-
-   Legacy Windows and SSL
-   ----------------------
-
-   WinSSL (specifically SChannel from Windows SSPI), is the native SSL library
-   in Windows. However, WinSSL in Windows <= XP is unable to connect to servers
-   that no longer support the legacy handshakes and algorithms used by those
-   versions. If you will be using curl in one of those earlier versions of
-   Windows you should choose another SSL backend such as OpenSSL.
-
-Apple iOS and Mac OS X
-======================
-
-   On recent Apple operating systems, curl can be built to use Apple's
-   SSL/TLS implementation, Secure Transport, instead of OpenSSL. To build with
-   Secure Transport for SSL/TLS, use the configure option --with-darwinssl. (It
-   is not necessary to use the option --without-ssl.) This feature requires iOS
-   5.0 or later, or OS X 10.5 ("Leopard") or later.
-
-   When Secure Transport is in use, the curl options --cacert and --capath and
-   their libcurl equivalents, will be ignored, because Secure Transport uses
-   the certificates stored in the Keychain to evaluate whether or not to trust
-   the server. This, of course, includes the root certificates that ship with
-   the OS. The --cert and --engine options, and their libcurl equivalents, are
-   currently unimplemented in curl with Secure Transport.
-
-   For OS X users: In OS X 10.8 ("Mountain Lion"), Apple made a major
-   overhaul to the Secure Transport API that, among other things, added
-   support for the newer TLS 1.1 and 1.2 protocols. To get curl to support
-   TLS 1.1 and 1.2, you must build curl on Mountain Lion or later, or by
-   using the equivalent SDK. If you set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
-   environmental variable to an earlier version of OS X prior to building curl,
-   then curl will use the new Secure Transport API on Mountain Lion and later,
-   and fall back on the older API when the same curl binary is executed on
-   older cats. For example, running these commands in curl's directory in the
-   shell will build the code such that it will run on cats as old as OS X 10.6
-   ("Snow Leopard") (using bash):
-
-      export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="10.6"
-      ./configure --with-darwinssl
-      make
-
-IBM OS/2
-========
-
-   Building under OS/2 is not much different from building under unix.
-   You need:
-
-      - emx 0.9d
-      - GNU make
-      - GNU patch
-      - ksh
-      - GNU bison
-      - GNU file utilities
-      - GNU sed
-      - autoconf 2.13
-
-   If you want to build with OpenSSL or OpenLDAP support, you'll need to
-   download those libraries, too. Dirk Ohme has done some work to port SSL
-   libraries under OS/2, but it looks like he doesn't care about emx.  You'll
-   find his patches on: http://come.to/Dirk_Ohme
-
-   If during the linking you get an error about _errno being an undefined
-   symbol referenced from the text segment, you need to add -D__ST_MT_ERRNO__
-   in your definitions.
-
-   If everything seems to work fine but there's no curl.exe, you need to add
-   -Zexe to your linker flags.
-
-   If you're getting huge binaries, probably your makefiles have the -g in
-   CFLAGS.
-
-VMS
-===
-
-   (The VMS section is in whole contributed by the friendly Nico Baggus)
-
-   Curl seems to work with FTP & HTTP other protocols are not tested.  (the
-   perl http/ftp testing server supplied as testing too cannot work on VMS
-   because vms has no concept of fork(). [ I tried to give it a whack, but
-   that's of no use.
-
-   SSL stuff has not been ported.
-
-   Telnet has about the same issues as for Win32. When the changes for Win32
-   are clear maybe they'll work for VMS too. The basic problem is that select
-   ONLY works for sockets.
-
-   Marked instances of fopen/[f]stat that might become a problem, especially
-   for non stream files. In this regard, the files opened for writing will be
-   created stream/lf and will thus be safe. Just keep in mind that non-binary
-   read/wring from/to files will have a records size limit of 32767 bytes
-   imposed.
-
-   Stat to get the size of the files is again only safe for stream files &
-   fixed record files without implied CC.
-
-   -- My guess is that only allowing access to stream files is the quickest
-   way to get around the most issues. Therefore all files need to to be
-   checked to be sure they will be stream/lf before processing them.  This is
-   the easiest way out, I know. The reason for this is that code that needs to
-   report the filesize will become a pain in the ass otherwise.
-
-   Exit status.... Well we needed something done here,
-
-   VMS has a structured exist status:
-   | 3  |       2    |     1       |  0|
-   |1098|765432109876|5432109876543|210|
-   +----+------------+-------------+---+
-   |Ctrl|  Facility  | Error code  |sev|
-   +----+------------+-------------+---+
-
-   With the Ctrl-bits an application can tell if part or the whole message has
-   already been printed from the program, DCL doesn't need to print it again.
-
-   Facility - basically the program ID. A code assigned to the program
-   the name can be fetched from external or internal message libraries
-   Error code - the err codes assigned by the application
-   Sev. - severity: Even = error, off = non error
-
-      0 = Warning
-      1 = Success
-      2 = Error
-      3 = Information
-      4 = Fatal
-      <5-7> reserved.
-
-   This all presents itself with:
-   %<FACILITY>-<Sev>-<Errorname>, <Error message>
-
-   See also the src/curlmsg.msg file, it has the source for the messages In
-   src/main.c a section is devoted to message status values, the globalvalues
-   create symbols with certain values, referenced from a compiled message
-   file. Have all exit function use a exit status derived from a translation
-   table with the compiled message codes.
-
-   This was all compiled with:
-
-      Compaq C V6.2-003 on OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-1H2
-
-   So far for porting notes as of:

-QNX
-===
-
-   (This section was graciously brought to us by David Bentham)
-
-   As QNX is targeted for resource constrained environments, the QNX headers
-   set conservative limits. This includes the FD_SETSIZE macro, set by default
-   to 32. Socket descriptors returned within the CURL library may exceed this,
-   resulting in memory faults/SIGSEGV crashes when passed into select(..)
-   calls using fd_set macros.
-
-   A good all-round solution to this is to override the default when building
-   libcurl, by overriding CFLAGS during configure, example
-
-   #  configure CFLAGS='-DFD_SETSIZE=64 -g -O2'
-
-RISC OS
-=======
-
-   The library can be cross-compiled using gccsdk as follows:
-
-        CC=riscos-gcc AR=riscos-ar RANLIB='riscos-ar -s' ./configure \
-             --host=arm-riscos-aof --without-random --disable-shared
-        make
-
-   where riscos-gcc and riscos-ar are links to the gccsdk tools.
-   You can then link your program with curl/lib/.libs/libcurl.a
-
-AmigaOS
-=======
-
-   (This section was graciously brought to us by Diego Casorran)
-
-   To build cURL/libcurl on AmigaOS just type 'make amiga' ...
-
-   What you need is:    (not tested with others versions)
-
-        GeekGadgets / gcc 2.95.3 (http://www.geekgadgets.org/)
-
-        AmiTCP SDK v4.3 (http://www.aminet.net/comm/tcp/AmiTCP-SDK-4.3.lha)
-
-        Native Developer Kit (http://www.amiga.com/3.9/download/NDK3.9.lha)
-
-   As no ixemul.library is required you will be able to build it for
-   WarpOS/PowerPC (not tested by me), as well a MorphOS version should be
-   possible with no problems.
-
-   To enable SSL support, you need a OpenSSL native version (without ixemul),
-   you can find a precompiled package at http://amiga.sourceforge.net/OpenSSL/
-
-NetWare
-=======
-
-   To compile curl.nlm / libcurl.nlm you need:
-
-   - either any gcc / nlmconv, or CodeWarrior 7 PDK 4 or later.
-   - gnu make and awk running on the platform you compile on;
-     native Win32 versions can be downloaded from:
-     http://www.gknw.net/development/prgtools/
-   - recent Novell LibC or Novell CLib SDK available from:
-     https://www.novell.com/developer/ndk/
-   - optional recent Novell CLDAP SDK available from:
-     https://www.novell.com/developer/ndk/ldap_libraries_for_c.html
-   - optional zlib sources (static or dynamic linking with zlib.imp);
-     sources with NetWare Makefile can be obtained from:
-     http://www.gknw.net/mirror/zlib/
-   - optional OpenSSL sources (version 0.9.8 or later build with BSD sockets);
-     you can find precompiled packages at:
-     http://www.gknw.net/development/ossl/netware/
-     for CLIB-based builds OpenSSL 0.9.8h or later is required  - earlier versions
-     don't support building with CLIB BSD sockets.
-   - optional SSH2 sources (version 0.17 or later);
-
-   Set a search path to your compiler, linker and tools; on Linux make
-   sure that the var OSTYPE contains the string 'linux'; set the var
-   NDKBASE to point to the base of your Novell NDK; and then type
-   'make netware' from the top source directory; other targets available
-   are 'netware-ssl', 'netware-ssl-zlib', 'netware-zlib' and 'netware-ares';
-   if you need other combinations you can control the build with the
-   environment variables WITH_SSL, WITH_ZLIB, WITH_ARES, WITH_SSH2, and
-   ENABLE_IPV6; you can set LINK_STATIC=1 to link curl.nlm statically.
-   By default LDAP support is enabled, however currently you will need a patch
-   in order to use the CLDAP NDK with BSD sockets (Novell Bug 300237):
-   http://www.gknw.net/test/curl/cldap_ndk/ldap_ndk.diff
-   I found on some Linux systems (RH9) that OS detection didn't work although
-   a 'set | grep OSTYPE' shows the var present and set; I simply overwrote it
-   with 'OSTYPE=linux-rh9-gnu' and the detection in the Makefile worked...
-   Any help in testing appreciated!
-   Builds automatically created 8 times a day from current git are here:
-   http://www.gknw.net/mirror/curl/autobuilds/
-   the status of these builds can be viewed at the autobuild table:
-   https://curl.haxx.se/dev/builds.html
-
-eCos
-====
-
-   curl does not use the eCos build system, so you must first build eCos
-   separately, then link curl to the resulting eCos library.  Here's a sample
-   configure line to do so on an x86 Linux box targeting x86:
-
-   GCCLIB=`gcc -print-libgcc-file-name` && \
-   CFLAGS="-D__ECOS=1 -nostdinc -I$ECOS_INSTALL/include \
-    -I`dirname $GCCLIB`/include" \
-   LDFLAGS="-nostdlib -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-static \
-    -L$ECOS_INSTALL/lib -Ttarget.ld -ltarget" \
-   ./configure --host=i386 --disable-shared \
-    --without-ssl --without-zlib --disable-manual --disable-ldap
-
-   In most cases, eCos users will be using libcurl from within a custom
-   embedded application.  Using the standard 'curl' executable from
-   within eCos means facing the limitation of the standard eCos C
-   startup code which does not allow passing arguments in main().  To
-   run 'curl' from eCos and have it do something useful, you will need
-   to either modify the eCos startup code to pass in some arguments, or
-   modify the curl application itself to retrieve its arguments from
-   some location set by the bootloader or hard-code them.
-
-   Something like the following patch could be used to hard-code some
-   arguments.  The MTAB_ENTRY line mounts a RAM disk as the root filesystem
-   (without mounting some kind of filesystem, eCos errors out all file
-   operations which curl does not take to well).  The next section synthesizes
-   some command-line arguments for curl to use, in this case to direct curl
-   to read further arguments from a file.  It then creates that file on the
-   RAM disk and places within it a URL to download: a file: URL that
-   just happens to point to the configuration file itself.  The results
-   of running curl in this way is the contents of the configuration file
-   printed to the console.

-=====
-
-   curl can be compiled on Minix 3 using gcc or ACK (starting with
-   ver. 3.1.3).  Ensure that GNU gawk and bash are both installed and
-   available in the PATH.
-
-   ACK
-   ---
-   Increase the heap sizes of the compiler with the command:
-
-     binsizes xxl
-
-   then configure and compile curl with:
-
-     ./configure CC=cc LD=cc AR=/usr/bin/aal GREP=grep \
-      CPPFLAGS='-D_POSIX_SOURCE=1 -I/usr/local/include'
-     make
-     chmem =256000 src/curl
-
-   GCC
-   ---
-   Make sure gcc is in your PATH with the command:
-
-     export PATH=/usr/gnu/bin:$PATH
-
-   then configure and compile curl with:
-
-     ./configure CC=gcc AR=/usr/gnu/bin/gar GREP=grep
-     make
-     chmem =256000 src/curl
-
-Symbian OS
-==========
-
-   The Symbian OS port uses the Symbian build system to compile.  From the
-   packages/Symbian/group/ directory, run:
-
-      bldmake bldfiles
-      abld build
-
-   to compile and install curl and libcurl using SBSv1. If your Symbian
-   SDK doesn't include support for P.I.P.S., you will need to contact
-   your SDK vendor to obtain that first.
-
-VxWorks
-========
-
-   Build for VxWorks is performed using cross compilation.
-   That means you build on Windows machine using VxWorks tools and
-   run the built image on the VxWorks device.
-
-   To build libcurl for VxWorks you need:
-
-      - CYGWIN (free, https://cygwin.com/)
-      - Wind River Workbench (commercial)
-
-   If you have CYGWIN and Workbench installed on you machine
-   follow after next steps:
-
-    1. Open the Command Prompt window and change directory ('cd')
-       to the libcurl 'lib' folder.
-    2. Add CYGWIN 'bin' folder to the PATH environment variable.
-       For example, type 'set PATH=C:/embedded/cygwin/bin;%PATH%'.
-    3. Adjust environment variables defined in 'Environment' section
-       of the Makefile.vxworks file to point to your software folders.
-    4. Build the libcurl by typing 'make -f ./Makefile.vxworks'
-
-   As a result the libcurl.a library should be created in the 'lib' folder.
-   To clean the build results type 'make -f ./Makefile.vxworks clean'.
-
-Android
-=======
-
-   Method using the static makefile:
-
-      - see the build notes in the packages/Android/Android.mk file.
-
-   Method using a configure cross-compile (tested with Android NDK r7c, r8):
-
-      - prepare the toolchain of the Android NDK for standalone use; this can
-        be done by invoking the script:
-        ./build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh
-        which creates a usual cross-compile toolchain. Lets assume that you put
-        this toolchain below /opt then invoke configure with something like:
-        export PATH=/opt/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/bin:$PATH
-        ./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi [more configure options]
-        make
-      - if you want to compile directly from our GIT repo you might run into
-        this issue with older automake stuff:
-        checking host system type...
-        Invalid configuration `arm-linux-androideabi':
-        system `androideabi' not recognized
-        configure: error: /bin/sh ./config.sub arm-linux-androideabi failed
-        this issue can be fixed with using more recent versions of config.sub
-        and config.guess which can be obtained here:
-        http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=tree
-        you need to replace your system-own versions which usually can be
-        found in your automake folder:
-        find /usr -name config.sub
-
-   Wrapper for pkg-config:
-
-      - In order to make proper use of pkg-config so that configure is able to
-        find all dependencies you should create a wrapper script for pkg-config;
-        file /opt/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-pkg-config:
-
-        #!/bin/sh
-        SYSROOT=$(dirname ${0%/*})/sysroot
-        export PKG_CONFIG_DIR=
-        export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=${SYSROOT}/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:${SYSROOT}/usr/share/pkgconfig
-        export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=${SYSROOT}
-        exec pkg-config "$@"
-
-        also create a copy or symlink with name arm-unknown-linux-androideabi-pkg-config.
-
-CROSS COMPILE
-=============
-
-   (This section was graciously brought to us by Jim Duey, with additions by
-   Dan Fandrich)
-
-   Download and unpack the cURL package.
-
-   'cd' to the new directory. (e.g. cd curl-7.12.3)
-
-   Set environment variables to point to the cross-compile toolchain and call
-   configure with any options you need.  Be sure and specify the '--host' and
-   '--build' parameters at configuration time.  The following script is an
-   example of cross-compiling for the IBM 405GP PowerPC processor using the
-   toolchain from MonteVista for Hardhat Linux.
-
-   (begin script)
-
-   #! /bin/sh
-
-   export PATH=$PATH:/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/405/bin
-   export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/405/target/usr/include"
-   export AR=ppc_405-ar
-   export AS=ppc_405-as
-   export LD=ppc_405-ld
-   export RANLIB=ppc_405-ranlib
-   export CC=ppc_405-gcc
-   export NM=ppc_405-nm
-
-   ./configure --target=powerpc-hardhat-linux \
-        --host=powerpc-hardhat-linux \
-        --build=i586-pc-linux-gnu \
-        --prefix=/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/405/target/usr/local \
-        --exec-prefix=/usr/local
-
-   (end script)
-
-   You may also need to provide a parameter like '--with-random=/dev/urandom'
-   to configure as it cannot detect the presence of a random number
-   generating device for a target system.  The '--prefix' parameter
-   specifies where cURL will be installed.  If 'configure' completes
-   successfully, do 'make' and 'make install' as usual.
-
-   In some cases, you may be able to simplify the above commands to as
-   little as:
-
-       ./configure --host=ARCH-OS
-
-REDUCING SIZE
-=============
-
-   There are a number of configure options that can be used to reduce the
-   size of libcurl for embedded applications where binary size is an
-   important factor.  First, be sure to set the CFLAGS variable when
-   configuring with any relevant compiler optimization flags to reduce the
-   size of the binary.  For gcc, this would mean at minimum the -Os option,
-   and potentially the -march=X, -mdynamic-no-pic and -flto options as well,
-   e.g.
-
-      ./configure CFLAGS='-Os' LDFLAGS='-Wl,-Bsymbolic'...
-
-   Note that newer compilers often produce smaller code than older versions
-   due to improved optimization.
-
-   Be sure to specify as many --disable- and --without- flags on the configure
-   command-line as you can to disable all the libcurl features that you
-   know your application is not going to need.  Besides specifying the
-   --disable-PROTOCOL flags for all the types of URLs your application
-   will not use, here are some other flags that can reduce the size of the
-   library:
-
-     --disable-ares (disables support for the C-ARES DNS library)
-     --disable-cookies (disables support for HTTP cookies)
-     --disable-crypto-auth (disables HTTP cryptographic authentication)
-     --disable-ipv6 (disables support for IPv6)
-     --disable-manual (disables support for the built-in documentation)
-     --disable-proxy (disables support for HTTP and SOCKS proxies)
-     --disable-unix-sockets (disables support for UNIX sockets)
-     --disable-verbose (eliminates debugging strings and error code strings)
-     --disable-versioned-symbols (disables support for versioned symbols)
-     --enable-hidden-symbols (eliminates unneeded symbols in the shared library)
-     --without-libidn (disables support for the libidn DNS library)
-     --without-librtmp (disables support for RTMP)
-     --without-ssl (disables support for SSL/TLS)
-     --without-zlib (disables support for on-the-fly decompression)
-
-   The GNU compiler and linker have a number of options that can reduce the
-   size of the libcurl dynamic libraries on some platforms even further.
-   Specify them by providing appropriate CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables on the
-   configure command-line, e.g.
-
-     CFLAGS="-Os -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections \
-             -fno-unwind-tables -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -flto" \
-     LDFLAGS="-Wl,-s -Wl,-Bsymbolic -Wl,--gc-sections"
-
-   Be sure also to strip debugging symbols from your binaries after
-   compiling using 'strip' (or the appropriate variant if cross-compiling).
-   If space is really tight, you may be able to remove some unneeded
-   sections of the shared library using the -R option to objcopy (e.g. the
-   .comment section).
-
-   Using these techniques it is possible to create a basic HTTP-only shared
-   libcurl library for i386 Linux platforms that is only 109 KiB in size, and
-   an FTP-only library that is 109 KiB in size (as of libcurl version 7.45.0,
-   using gcc 4.9.2).
-
-   You may find that statically linking libcurl to your application will
-   result in a lower total size than dynamically linking.
-
-   Note that the curl test harness can detect the use of some, but not all, of
-   the --disable statements suggested above. Use will cause tests relying on
-   those features to fail.  The test harness can be manually forced to skip
-   the relevant tests by specifying certain key words on the runtests.pl
-   command line.  Following is a list of appropriate key words:
-
-     --disable-cookies          !cookies
-     --disable-manual           !--manual
-     --disable-proxy            !HTTP\ proxy !proxytunnel !SOCKS4 !SOCKS5

   "struct `Curl_handler` `Curl_handler_[protocol]`" declared. In url.c there's

 If the \fBlength\fP argument is set to 0 (zero), \fIcurl_easy_unescape(3)\fP
 will use strlen() on the input \fIurl\fP string to find out the size.
 
 If \fBoutlength\fP is non-NULL, the function will write the length of the
 returned string in the integer it points to. This allows an escaped string
-containing %00 to still get used properly after unescaping.
+containing %00 to still get used properly after unescaping. Since this is a
+pointer to an \fIint\fP type, it can only return a value up to INT_MAX so no
+longer string can be unescaped if the string length is returned in this

 You must \fIcurl_free(3)\fP the returned string when you're done with it.
 .SH AVAILABILITY
 Added in 7.15.4 and replaces the old \fIcurl_unescape(3)\fP function.
 .SH RETURN VALUE
 A pointer to a zero terminated string or NULL if it failed.

+\fIcurl_global_cleanup(3)\fP does not block waiting for any libcurl-created
+threads to terminate (such as threads used for name resolving). If a module
+containing libcurl is dynamically unloaded while libcurl-created threads are

 CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_COOKIELIST,
                            struct curl_slist **cookies);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a pointer to a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of all
-cookies cURL knows (expired ones, too). Don't forget to call
+cookies curl knows (expired ones, too). Don't forget to call
 \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP on the list after it has been used.  If there are
 no cookies (cookies for the handle have not been enabled or simply none have
 been received) 'struct curl_slist *' will be set to point to NULL.
 
 Since 7.43.0 cookies that were imported in the Set-Cookie format without a
 domain name are not exported by this option.

 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH, long max);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a long. The set \fBmax\fP number will be used as the maximum amount of
-outstanding requests in a pipelined connection. Only used if pipelining is
-enabled.
+outstanding requests in an HTTP/1.1 pipelined connection. This option is only
+used for HTTP/1.1 pipelining, not for HTTP/2 multiplexing.
 
 When this limit is reached, libcurl will use another connection to the same
 host (see \fICURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP), or queue the request until
 one of the pipelines to the host is ready to accept a request.  Thus, the
 total number of requests in-flight is \fICURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP *
 \fICURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH(3)\fP.

 Pass a long that holds a bitmask of CURLPROTO_* defines. If used, this bitmask
 limits what protocols libcurl may use in a transfer that it follows to in a
 redirect when \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP is enabled. This allows you to
 limit specific transfers to only be allowed to use a subset of protocols in
 redirections.
 
+Protocols denied by \fICURLOPT_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP are not overridden by this
+option.
+
 By default libcurl will allow all protocols on redirect except several disabled
 for security reasons: Since 7.19.4 FILE and SCP are disabled, and since 7.40.0
 SMB and SMBS are also disabled. \fICURLPROTO_ALL\fP enables all protocols on
 redirect, including those disabled for security.
 
 These are the available protocol defines:

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Enables the use of Unix domain sockets as connection endpoint and sets the path
 to \fIpath\fP. If \fIpath\fP is NULL, then Unix domain sockets are disabled. An
 empty string will result in an error at some point, it will not disable use of
 Unix domain sockets.
 
-When enabled, cURL will connect to the Unix domain socket instead of
+When enabled, curl will connect to the Unix domain socket instead of
 establishing a TCP connection to a host. Since no TCP connection is created,
-cURL does not need to resolve the DNS hostname in the URL.
+curl does not need to resolve the DNS hostname in the URL.
 
 The maximum path length on Cygwin, Linux and Solaris is 107. On other platforms
 it might be even less.

   to the 'distros' mailing list to allow them to use the fix prior to the
   public announcement.
 
-- At the day of the next release, the private branch is merged into the master
-  branch and pushed. Once pushed, the information is accessible to the public
-  and the actual release should follow suit immediately afterwards.
+- No more than 48 hours before the release, the private branch is merged into
+  the master branch and pushed. Once pushed, the information is accessible to
+  the public and the actual release should follow suit immediately afterwards.
+  The time between the push and the release is used for final tests and
+  reviews.
 
 - The project team creates a release that includes the fix.
 
 - The project team announces the release and the vulnerability to the world in
   the same manner we always announce releases. It gets sent to the
   curl-announce, curl-library and curl-users mailing lists.
 
 - The security web page on the web site should get the new vulnerability
   mentioned.
 
+Pre-notification
+----------------
 
+If you think you are or should be eligible for a pre-notifcation about
+upcoming security announcements for curl, we urge OS distros and similar
+vendors to primarily join the distros@openwall list as that is one of the
+purposes of that list - and not just for curl of course.
+
+If you are not a distro or otherwise not suitable for distros@openwall and yet
+want pre-notifications from us, contact the curl security team with a detailed
+and clear explanation why this is the case.

 Who is on this list? There are a couple of criteria you must meet, and then we
 might ask you to join the list or you can ask to join it. It really isn't very
 formal. We basically only require that you have a long-term presence in the
 curl project and you have shown an understanding for the project and its way

+ approach makes the libcurl build only create a set of public headers suitable
+ for one of the architectures and not both. If you build libcurl for such a
+ platform and you want to allow applications to get built using either 32/64
+ version, you must generate the libcurl headers once for each setup and you
+ must then add a replacement curl header that would itself select the correct
+ 32 or 64 bit specific header as necessary.
+
+ Your curl/curl.h alternative could then look like (replace with suitable CPP

+ be used for all architectures independently of what libcurl was built for.
