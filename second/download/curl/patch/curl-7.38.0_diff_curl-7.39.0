-- RELEASE-NOTES: final update for 7.38.0
+Daniel Stenberg (5 Nov 2014)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: 7.39.0 release (commit b3875606925)
 
-- cookies: reject incoming cookies set for TLDs
+- curl_easy_duphandle: CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS read out of bounds
   
-  Test 61 was modified to verify this.
+  When duplicating a handle, the data to post was duplicated using
+  strdup() when it could be binary and contain zeroes and it was not even
+  zero terminated! This caused read out of bounds crashes/segfaults.
   
-  CVE-2014-3620
+  Since the lib/strdup.c file no longer is easily shared with the curl
+  tool with this change, it now uses its own version instead.
   
-  Reported-by: Tim Ruehsen
-  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20140910B.html
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20141105.html
+  CVE: CVE-2014-3707
+  Reported-By: Symeon Paraschoudis
 
-- [Tim Ruehsen brought this change]
-
-  cookies: only use full host matches for hosts used as IP address
+- lib544.c: use duphandle for test 545
   
-  By not detecting and rejecting domain names for partial literal IP
-  addresses properly when parsing received HTTP cookies, libcurl can be
-  fooled to both send cookies to wrong sites and to allow arbitrary sites
-  to set cookies for others.
+  To verify that curl_easy_duphandle() works fine on a handle that has
+  gotten data stored with *_COPYPOSTFIELDS.
+
+- tests: add new feature 'SSLpinning'
   
-  CVE-2014-3613
+  ... and make test 2034 and 2035 require it, and have it set when built
+  with OpenSSL or GnuTLS.
+
+- buildconf: update copyright year
+
+Steve Holme (4 Nov 2014)
+- INSTALL: Consistent spacing in section headings, paragraphs and examples
+
+Daniel Stenberg (4 Nov 2014)
+- buildconf: stop checking for libtool
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20140910A.html
+  As we only use libtoolize, only check for that!
 
-- HISTORY: fix the 1998 title position
+Steve Holme (4 Nov 2014)
+- INSTALL: Corrected MIT Kerberos and Heimdal package names
 
-- HISTORY: extended and now markdown
+- README: Corrected inconsistent use of --help
 
-- SSLCERTS: converted to markdown
+- INSTALL: Use GSS-API rather than GSSAPI
   
-  Only minor edits to make it generate nice HTML output using markdown, as
-  this document serves both in source release tarballs as on the web site.
+  As implementations are refereed to GSS-API libraries as per the RFC and
+  GSSAPI typically refers to the SASL authentication mechanism.
   
-  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
+  ...and minor rewording on the same paragraph.

+  SSL: PolarSSL default min SSL version TLS 1.0
+  
+  - Prior to this change no SSL minimum version was set by default at
+  runtime for PolarSSL. Therefore in most cases PolarSSL would probably
+  have defaulted to a minimum version of SSLv3 which is no longer secure.
 
-- polarassl: avoid memset() when clearing the first byte is enough
+- opts-Makefile: put more man pages into dist and make hmtl+pdf
 
-- [Catalin Patulea brought this change]

-- RELEASE-NOTES: fix the required nghttp2 version typo
+  Curl_single_getsock: fix hold/pause sock handling
+  
+  The previous condition that checked if the socket was marked as readable
+  when also adding a writable one, was incorrect and didn't take the pause
+  bits properly into account.

-  Ensure progress.size_dl/progress.size_ul are always >= 0
+  cmake: fix struct sockaddr_storage check
   
-  Historically the default "unknown" value for progress.size_dl and
-  progress.size_ul has been zero, since these values are initialized
-  implicitly by the calloc that allocates the curl handle that these
-  variables are a part of.  Users of curl that install progress
-  callbacks may expect these values to always be >= 0.
+  CHECK_TYPE_SIZE_PREINCLUDE is an internal, undocumented variable which
+  was removed in cmake 2.8.1. According to the MSDN docs[1], inclusion
+  of winsock2.h is sufficient. WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN does not really seem
+  to affect the tests, so remove it too[2].
   
-  Currently it is possible for progress.size_dl and progress.size_ul
-  to by set to a value of -1, if Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() or
-  Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize() are passed a "size" of -1 (which a few
-  places currently do, and a following patch will add more).  So
-  lets update Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() and Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize()
-  so they make sure that these variables always contain a value that
-  is >= 0.
+  For the non-windows case, remove inet headers as POSIX only requires
+  sys/socket.h.
   
-  Updates test579 and test599.

-- tests: Added test1420 to the makefile
+  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
 
-- test1420: Removed unnecessary CURLOPT setting
+- [Peter Wu brought this change]
 
-- tests: Added more "Clear Text" authentication keywords
+  cmake: clean OtherTests, fixing -Werror
+  
+  There were several -Wunused warnings and one duplicate macro definition.
+  The EXTRA_DEFINES variable of the CurlCheckCSources macro was being
+  abused ("__unused1\n#undef inline\n#define __unused2", seriously?) to
+  insert extra C code. Avoid this broken abstraction and use cmake's
+  check_c_source_compiles directly (works fine with CMake 2.8, maybe
+  even cmake 2.6).
+  
+  After cleaning up all related variables (EXTRA_DEFINES,
+  HEADER_INCLUDES, auxiliary headers_hack), also remove a duplicate
+  add_headers_include macro and remove duplicate header additions before
+  the struct timeval check.
+  
+  Oh, and now the code is converted to use CheckCSourceRuns and
+  CheckCSourceCompiles, the two curl-specific helpers can be removed.
+  Unfortunately, the cmake output is now slightly more verbose. Before:
+  
+      Performing Test int send(int, const void *, size_t, int) (curl_cv_func_send_test)
+      Performing Test int send(int, const void *, size_t, int) (curl_cv_func_send_test) - Failed
+  
+  Since check_c_source_compiles prints the varname, now you see:
+  
+      Performing Test curl_cv_func_send_test
+      Performing Test curl_cv_func_send_test - Failed
+      Tested: int send(int, const void *, size_t, int)
+  
+  Compared cmake output with each other using vimdiff, no functional
+  differences were found. Tested with GCC 4.9.1 and Clang 3.5.0.

-- tests: Updated "based on" text due to email test renumbering
+- [Peter Wu brought this change]
 
-- tests: For consistency added --libcurl to test name
+  cmake: fix gethostby{addr,name}_r in CurlTests
+  
+  This patch cleans up the automatically-generated (?) code and fixes one
+  case that will always fail due to syntax error.
+  
+  HAVE_GETHOSTBYADDR_R_5_REENTRANT always failed because of a trailing
+  character ("int length;q"). Several parameter type and unused variable
+  warnings popped up. This causes a detection failure with -Werror.
+  
+  Observe that the REENTRANT cases are exactly the same as their
+  non-REENTRANT cases except for a `_REENTRANT` macro definition.
+  Merge all these pieces and build one big main function with different
+  cases, but reusing variables where logical.
+  
+  For the cases where the parameters where NULL, I looked at
+  lib/hostip4.c to get an idea of the parameters types.
+  
+  void-cast variables such as 'rc' to avoid -Wuninitialized errors.

-- multi.c: Avoid invalid memory read after free() from commit 3c8c873252
+  cmake: drop _BSD_SOURCE macro usage
   
-  As the current element in the list is free()d by Curl_llist_remove(),
-  when the associated connection is pending, reworked the loop to avoid
-  accessing the next element through e->next afterward.
-
-- multi.c: Fixed compilation warning from commit 3c8c873252
+  autotools does not use features.h nor _BSD_SOURCE. As this macro
+  triggers warnings since glibc 2.20, remove it. It should not have
+  functional differences.
   
-  warning: implicit conversion from enumeration type 'CURLMcode' to
-  different enumeration type 'CURLcode'
+  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
 
-- url.c: Use CURLAUTH_NONE constant rather than 0
+Steve Holme (2 Nov 2014)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with d71ea7c01e
   
-  Small follow up to commit 898808fa8c to use auth constants rather than
-  hard code value when clearing picked authentication mechanism.
+  Additionally, updated "GSSAPI" to "GSS-API" for a Cmake related change
+  as GSSAPI can be confused with the authentication mechanism rather than
+  a GSS-API implementation library such as MIT or Heimdal.
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with fd1ce3856a
+- build: Added WinIDN build configuration options
+  
+  Added support for WinIDN build configurations to the VC6 project files.
 
-Nick Zitzmann (4 Sep 2014)
-- [Vilmos Nebehaj brought this change]
+- build: Added WinIDN build configuration options
+  
+  Added support for WinIDN build configurations to the VC7 and VC7.1
+  project files.
 
-  darwinssl: Use CopyCertSubject() to check CA cert.
+- build: Fixed the pre-processor separator in Visual Studio project files
   
-  SecCertificateCopyPublicKey() is not available on iPhone. Use
-  CopyCertSubject() instead to see if the certificate returned by
-  SecCertificateCreateWithData() is valid.
+  A left over from the VC6 project files, so mainly cosmetic in Visual
+  Studio .NET as it can handle both comma and semi-colon characters for
+  separating multiple pre-processor definitions.
   
-  Reported-by: Toby Peterson
+  However, the IDE uses semi-colons if the value is edited, and as such,
+  this may cause problems in future for anyone updating the files or
+  merging patches.
+  
+  Used the Visual Studio IDE to correct the separator character.
 
-Steve Holme (4 Sep 2014)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: Clarify email Kerberos support is currently via Windows SSPI
+- build: Added optional specific version generation of VC project files
+  
+  ..when working from the git repository. This is particularly useful
+  for single development environments where the project files for all
+  supported versions of Visual Studio may not be required.

-- THANKS: added Dennis Clarke
-  
-  Dennis Clarke from Blastwave.org for ensuring that nightly builds run
-  smooth on Solaris!
+- CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER.3: Corrected the OAuth version number
 
-- curl_multi_cleanup: remove superfluous NULL assigns
+- CURLOPT_SASL_IR.3: Added supported mechanism information
   
-  ... as the struct is free()d in the end anyway. It was first pointed out
-  to me that one of the ->msglist assignments were supposed to have been
-  ->pending but was a copy and paste mistake when I realized none of the
-  clearing of pointers had to be there.
+  ...and removed duplication of what protocols are supported from the
+  description text.
 
-- multi: convert CURLM_STATE_CONNECT_PEND handling to a list
-  
-  ... instead of scanning through all handles, stash only the actual
-  handles that are in that state in the new ->pending list and scan that
-  list only. It should be mostly empty or very short. And only used for
-  pipelining.
+- opts: Use common wording for MAIL related names
+
+- opts: Use common wording for TLS user/password option names
   
-  This avoids a rather hefty slow-down especially notable if you add many
-  handles to the same multi handle. Regression introduced in commit
-  0f147887 (version 7.30.0).
+  ...and revised the proxy wording a little as well.
+
+- CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS.3: Reworked the description to be less confusing
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2014-07/0206.html
-  Reported-by: David Meyer

+- sasl: Fixed Kerberos V5 inclusion when CURL_DISABLE_CRYPTO_AUTH is used
   
-  darwinssl: now accepts cacert bundles in PEM format in addition to single certs
+  Typically the USE_WINDOWS_SSPI definition would not be used when the
+  CURL_DISABLE_CRYPTO_AUTH define is, however, it is still a valid build
+  configuration and, as such, the SASL Kerberos V5 (GSSAPI) authentication
+  data structures and functions would incorrectly be used when they
+  shouldn't be.
+  
+  Introduced a new USE_KRB5 definition that takes into account the use of
+  CURL_DISABLE_CRYPTO_AUTH like USE_SPNEGO and USE_NTLM do.

-- low-speed-limit: avoid timeout flood
+Daniel Stenberg (1 Nov 2014)
+- resume: consider a resume from [content-length] to be OK
   
-  Introducing Curl_expire_latest(). To be used when we the code flow only
-  wants to get called at a later time that is "no later than X" so that
-  something can be checked (and another timeout be added).
+  Basically since servers often then don't respond well to this and
+  instead send the full contents and then libcurl would instead error out
+  with the assumption that the server doesn't support resume. As the data
+  is then already transfered, this is now considered fine.
   
-  The low-speed logic for example could easily be made to set very many
-  expire timeouts if it would be called faster or sooner than what it had
-  set its own timer and this goes for a few other timers too that aren't
-  explictiy checked for timer expiration in the code.
+  Test case 1434 added to verify this. Test case 1042 slightly modified.
   
-  If there's no condition the code that says if(time-passed >= TIME), then
-  Curl_expire_latest() is preferred to Curl_expire().

+  and pkg-config. Not all features and or protocols can be enabled as
+  these are missing additional checks (see new TODOs).
   
-  Corrected a number of the error codes that can be returned from the
-  Curl_sasl_create_gssapi_security_message() function when things go
-  wrong.
+  SUPPORT_PROTOCOLS is partially scripted (grep for SUPPORT_PROTOCOLS=)
+  and manually verified/modified. SUPPORT_FEATURES is manually added.
   
-  It makes more sense to return CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING when the
-  inbound security challenge can't be decoded correctly or doesn't
-  contain the KERB_WRAP_NO_ENCRYPT flag and CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY when
-  EncryptMessage() fails. Unfortunately the previous error code of
-  CURLE_RECV_ERROR was a copy and paste mistakes on my part and should
-  have been correct in commit 4b491c675f :(

-  rather than a fixed buffer of 1024 bytes.
+  Coverity CID 252518. This function is in general far too complicated for
+  its own good and really should be broken down into several smaller
+  funcitons instead - but I'm adding this protection here now since it

+  NULL pointer.
 
-- sasl_sspi: Fixed missing free of challenge buffer on SPN failure
+- operate: avoid NULL dereference

-- http_negotiate_sspi: Tidy up to remove the get_gss_name() function

+  Coverity CID 1241951. The condition 'len >= 0' would always be true at
+  that point and thus not necessary to check for.
 
-- http_negotiate_sspi: Use a dynamic buffer for SPN generation
+- krb5_encode: remove unused argument
   
-  Updated to use a dynamic buffer for the SPN generation via the recently
-  introduced Curl_sasl_build_spn() function rather than a fixed buffer of
-  1024 characters, which should have been more than enough, but by using
-  the new function removes the need for another variable sname to do the
-  wide character conversion in Unicode builds.

+- multi_runsingle: fix possible memory leak
   
-  Various parts of the libcurl source code build a SPN for inclusion in

-  generation routines or passed to authentication functions in third-party
-  libraries such as SSPI. However, some of these instances use fixed
-  buffers rather than dynamically allocated ones and not all of those that
-  should, convert to wide character strings in Unicode builds.
+  Coverity CID 1202837. 'newurl' can in fact be allocated even when
+  Curl_retry_request() returns failure so free it if need be.
+
+- ares::Curl_resolver_cancel: skip checking for NULL conn
   
-  Implemented a common function that generates a SPN and performs the
-  wide character conversion where necessary.
+  Coverity CID 1243581. 'conn' will never be NULL here, and if it would be
+  the subsequent statement would dereference it!
 
-- sasl_sspi: Fixed memory leak with not releasing Package Info struct
+- parseconfig: skip a NULL check
   
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() wouldn't free the Package Info
-  structure after QuerySecurityPackageInfo() had allocated it.
+  Coverity CID 1154198. This NULL check implies that the pointer _can_ be
+  NULL at this point, which it can't. Thus it is dead code. It tricks
+  static analyzers to warn about dereferencing the pointer since the code
+  seems to imply it can be NULL.

-  As such the existing detection mechanism for determining whether or not
-  the authentication process has finished is not sufficient.
+  This patch fixes the "SSL3_WRITE_PENDING: bad write retry" error that
+  sometimes occurs when sending an email over SMTPS with OpenSSL. OpenSSL
+  appears to require the same pointer on a write that follows a retry
+  (CURLE_AGAIN) as discussed here:
   
-  However, the WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate header line will not contain
-  any data when the server has exhausted the negotiation, so we can use
-  that coupled with the already allocated context pointer.

-  Macros defined: KRB5_MECHANISM and SPNEGO_MECHANISM called from

-
-- CONNECT: Revert Curl_proxyCONNECT back to 7.29.0 design
+  Historically the default "unknown" value for progress.size_dl and
+  progress.size_ul has been zero, since these values are initialized
+  implicitly by the calloc that allocates the curl handle that these
+  variables are a part of.  Users of curl that install progress
+  callbacks may expect these values to always be >= 0.
   
-  This reverts commit cb3e6dfa3511 and instead fixes the problem
-  differently.
+  Currently it is possible for progress.size_dl and progress.size_ul
+  to by set to a value of -1, if Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() or
+  Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize() are passed a "size" of -1 (which a few
+  places currently do, and a following patch will add more).  So
+  lets update Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() and Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize()
+  so they make sure that these variables always contain a value that
+  is >= 0.
   
-  The reverted commit addressed a test failure in test 1021 by simplifying
-  and generalizing the code flow in a way that damaged the
-  performance. Now we modify the flow so that Curl_proxyCONNECT() again
-  does as much as possible in one go, yet still do test 1021 with and
-  without valgrind. It failed due to mistakes in the multi state machine.
+  Updates test579 and test599.

-
-- [David Woodhouse brought this change]
-
-  Don't abort Negotiate auth when the server has a response for us
-  
-  It's wrong to assume that we can send a single SPNEGO packet which will
-  complete the authentication. It's a *negotiation* â€” the clue is in the
-  name. So make sure we handle responses from the server.
-  
-  Curl_input_negotiate() will already handle bailing out if it thinks the
-  state is GSS_S_COMPLETE (or SEC_E_OK on Windows) and the server keeps
-  talking to us, so we should avoid endless loops that way.
-
-- [David Woodhouse brought this change]
-
-  Don't clear GSSAPI state between each exchange in the negotiation
-  
-  GSSAPI doesn't work very well if we forget everything ever time.
-  
-  XX: Is Curl_http_done() the right place to do the final cleanup?
-
-- [David Woodhouse brought this change]
-
-  Use SPNEGO for HTTP Negotiate
-  
-  This is the correct way to do SPNEGO. Just ask for it
-  
-  Now I correctly see it trying NTLMSSP authentication when a Kerberos ticket
-  isn't available. Of course, we bail out when the server responds with the
-  challenge packet, since we don't expect that. But I'll fix that bug next...
-
-- [David Woodhouse brought this change]
-
-  Remove all traces of FBOpenSSL SPNEGO support
-  
-  This is just fundamentally broken. SPNEGO (RFC4178) is a protocol which
-  allows client and server to negotiate the underlying mechanism which will
-  actually be used to authenticate. This is *often* Kerberos, and can also
-  be NTLM and other things. And to complicate matters, there are various
-  different OIDs which can be used to specify the Kerberos mechanism too.
-  
-  A SPNEGO exchange will identify *which* GSSAPI mechanism is being used,
-  and will exchange GSSAPI tokens which are appropriate for that mechanism.
-  
-  But this SPNEGO implementation just strips the incoming SPNEGO packet
-  and extracts the token, if any. And completely discards the information
-  about *which* mechanism is being used. Then we *assume* it was Kerberos,
-  and feed the token into gss_init_sec_context() with the default
-  mechanism (GSS_S_NO_OID for the mech_type argument).
-  
-  Furthermore... broken as this code is, it was never even *used* for input
-  tokens anyway, because higher layers of curl would just bail out if the
-  server actually said anything *back* to us in the negotiation. We assume
-  that we send a single token to the server, and it accepts it. If the server
-  wants to continue the exchange (as is required for NTLM and for SPNEGO
-  to do anything useful), then curl was broken anyway.
-  
-  So the only bit which actually did anything was the bit in
-  Curl_output_negotiate(), which always generates an *initial* SPNEGO
-  token saying "Hey, I support only the Kerberos mechanism and this is its
-  token".
-  
-  You could have done that by manually just prefixing the Kerberos token
-  with the appropriate bytes, if you weren't going to do any proper SPNEGO
-  handling. There's no need for the FBOpenSSL library at all.
-  
-  The sane way to do SPNEGO is just to *ask* the GSSAPI library to do
-  SPNEGO. That's what the 'mech_type' argument to gss_init_sec_context()
-  is for. And then it should all Just Workâ„¢.
-  
-  That 'sane way' will be added in a subsequent patch, as will bug fixes
-  for our failure to handle any exchange other than a single outbound
-  token to the server which results in immediate success.

+- disconnect: don't touch easy-related state on disconnects
+  
+  This was done to make sure NTLM state that is bound to a connection

+  cache and thus that connection is not strictly related to the easy

+  
+  The http authentication state is still kept in the easy handle since all
+  http auth _except_ NTLM is connection independent and thus survive over

-  create_digest_md5_message: generate base64 instead of hex string
+  Various parts of the libcurl source code build a SPN for inclusion in

+  libraries such as SSPI. However, some of these instances use fixed
+  buffers rather than dynamically allocated ones and not all of those that
+  should, convert to wide character strings in Unicode builds.

-  As with commit 11397eb6dd, use $(TargetDir) and $(TargetName) for the
-  Import Library output rather than $(OutDir)\$(ProjectName)d.lib and
-  $(OutDir)\$(ProjectName).lib.
+  This seems to be the way it should work. Right now we can't build with

-  openssl: Fix uninitialized variable use in NPN callback

-  OpenSSL passes out and outlen variable uninitialized to
-  select_next_proto_cb callback function.  If the callback function
-  returns SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK, the caller assumes the callback filled
-  values in out and outlen and processes as such.  Previously, if there
-  is no overlap in protocol lists, curl code does not fill any values in
-  these variables and returns SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK, which means we are

-  An enumerated type is mixed with another type.
-
-- tool_operate.c: Fixed compilation warnings
+  This is just fundamentally broken. SPNEGO (RFC4178) is a protocol which
+  allows client and server to negotiate the underlying mechanism which will
+  actually be used to authenticate. This is *often* Kerberos, and can also
+  be NTLM and other things. And to complicate matters, there are various

-  An enumerated type is mixed with another type.

-- http: avoid auth failure on a duplicated header
+  But this SPNEGO implementation just strips the incoming SPNEGO packet
+  and extracts the token, if any. And completely discards the information
+  about *which* mechanism is being used. Then we *assume* it was Kerberos,
+  and feed the token into gss_init_sec_context() with the default
+  mechanism (GSS_S_NO_OID for the mech_type argument).
   
-  ... 'WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate' received from server
+  Furthermore... broken as this code is, it was never even *used* for input
+  tokens anyway, because higher layers of curl would just bail out if the
+  server actually said anything *back* to us in the negotiation. We assume
+  that we send a single token to the server, and it accepts it. If the server
+  wants to continue the exchange (as is required for NTLM and for SPNEGO
+  to do anything useful), then curl was broken anyway.

-- cacertinmem: fix memory leak
+  So the only bit which actually did anything was the bit in
+  Curl_output_negotiate(), which always generates an *initial* SPNEGO
+  token saying "Hey, I support only the Kerberos mechanism and this is its
+  token".
   
-  While "just" an example it still isn't nice to leak memory.
+  You could have done that by manually just prefixing the Kerberos token
+  with the appropriate bytes, if you weren't going to do any proper SPNEGO
+  handling. There's no need for the FBOpenSSL library at all.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1368
-  Fixed-by: Marko
+  The sane way to do SPNEGO is just to *ask* the GSSAPI library to do
+  SPNEGO. That's what the 'mech_type' argument to gss_init_sec_context()
+  is for. And then it should all Just Workâ„¢.
+  
+  That 'sane way' will be added in a subsequent patch, as will bug fixes
+  for our failure to handle any exchange other than a single outbound
+  token to the server which results in immediate success.

-  Since all present tests now have <keywords> listed, this script will now

-  Hopefully this will help us make sure new test cases get keywords added
-  at start.
+  OpenSSL passes out and outlen variable uninitialized to
+  select_next_proto_cb callback function.  If the callback function
+  returns SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK, the caller assumes the callback filled
+  values in out and outlen and processes as such.  Previously, if there
+  is no overlap in protocol lists, curl code does not fill any values in
+  these variables and returns SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK, which means we are
+  triggering undefined behavior.  valgrind warns this.

+- darwinssl: fix lint & build warnings in the previous commit
 
-- tests: Added SMTP with credentials test for RFC-821 based server
+- [Vilmos Nebehaj brought this change]
+
+  Add support for --cacert in DarwinSSL.
   
-  Added SMTP (RFC-821 only) based test case as a reference for the fix
-  provided by commit fe260b75e7.
+  Security Framework on OS X makes it possible to supply extra anchor (CA)
+  certificates via the Certificate, Key, and Trust Services API. This
+  commit makes the '--cacert' option work using this API.
+  
+  More information:
+  
+  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/security/Reference/certifkeytrustservices/Reference/reference.html
+  
+  The HTTPS tests now pass on OS X except 314, which requires the '--crl'
+  option to work.

+Daniel Stenberg (22 May 2014)
+- bits.close: introduce connection close tracking
   
-  Remove a superfluous "negotiated http2" info line
+  Make all code use connclose() and connkeep() when changing the "close
+  state" for a connection. These two macros take a string argument with an
+  explanation, and debug builds of curl will include that in the debug
+  output. Helps tracking connection re-use/close issues.

-  We're progressing throught drafts so there's no point in having a fixed
-  one in a symbol that'll survive.
+  Renamed the CURLX_ONES file list definition in order to a) try and be
+  consistent with other file lists and b) to allow for the addition of
+  the curlx header files, which will assist with Visual Studio project
+  files generation rather than hard coding those files.

+- THANKS: 18 new contributors for 7.37.0
 
-  curl: stop interpreting IPv6 literals as glob patterns.

+  Possibly the final update before release...
+
+Steve Holme (20 May 2014)
+- README: Added some outstanding tasks to the TODO list
   
-  This creates no ambiguity, because there is no overlap between the
-  syntax of valid globs and valid IPv6 literals.  Globs contain hyphens
-  and at most 1 colon, while IPv6 literals have no hyphens, and at least 2
-  colons.
+  Added a couple of outstanding tasks to the TODO section that we didn't
+  get time to do before the release.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 May 2014)
+- http2: make connection re-use work
   
-  The peek_ipv6() parser simply whitelists a set of characters and counts
-  colons, because the real validation happens later on.  The character set
-  includes A-Z, in case someone decides to implement support for scopes
-  like [fe80::1%25eth0] in the future.
+  Http2 connections would wrongly get closed after each individual
+  request.

+- timers: fix timer regression involving redirects / reconnects
+  
+  In commit 0b3750b5c23c25f (released in 7.36.0) we fixed a timeout issue
+  but instead broke the timings.
+  
+  To fix this, I introduce a new timestamp to use for the timeouts and
+  restored the previous timestamp and timestamp position so that the old
+  timer functionality is restored.
+  
+  In addition to that, that change also broke connection timeouts for when
+  more than one connect was used (as it would then count the total time
+  from the first connect and not for the most recent one). Now
+  Curl_timeleft() has been modified so that it checks against different
+  start times depending on which timeout it checks.
+  
+  Test 1303 is updated accordingly.

-  polarssl: drop use of 1.2 compatibility header.
-  
-  API has changed since version 1.3. A compatibility header has been created
-  to ensure forward compatibility for code using old API:
-   * x509 certificate structure has been renamed to from x509_cert to
-     x509_crt
-   * new dedicated setter for RSA certificates ssl_set_own_cert_rsa,
-     ssl_set_own_cert is for generic keys
-   * ssl_default_ciphersuites has been replaced by function
-     ssl_list_ciphersuites()
+  mk-ca-bundle: added -p
   
-  This patch drops the use of the compatibly header.
+  -p takes a list of Mozilla trust purposes and levels for certificates to
+  include in output.  Takes the form of a comma separated list of
+  purposes, a colon, and a comma separated list of levels.

-- multi_runsingle: move timestamp into INIT
+- schannel: don't use the connect-timeout during send
   
-  Setting the TIMER_STARTSINGLE timestamp first in CONNECT has the
-  drawback that for actions that go back to the CONNECT state, the time
-  stamp is reset and for the multi_socket API there's no corresponding
-  Curl_expire() then so the timeout logic gets wrong!
+  As there's a default connection timeout and this wrongly used the
+  connection timeout during a transfer after the connection is completed,
+  this function would trigger timeouts during transfers erroneously.

+  Commit 07b66cbfa4 unfortunately broke native NTLM message support in

-- tool: Do not output libcurl source for the information only parameters
-  
-  Ensure a source file isn't generated for the following informational
-  command line parameters when --libcurl is specified:
-  
-  --help, --manual, --version and --engine list
+- build: Added Visual Studio 2003 .NET (VC7.1) project files
   
-  As the output would only include a fairly empty looking main() function
-  and a call to curl_easy_init() and curl_easy_cleanup() when performed
-  with --engine list.

+- test585: Fixed NULL pointer dereference in fopen
+
+Steve Holme (30 Apr 2014)
+- build: Fixed generation when source file names contain spaces
   
-  Correctly output libcurl source code that includes multiply operations
-  as specified by --next. Note that each operation evaluates to a single
-  curl_easy_perform() in source code form.
+  This shouldn't happen with the source files in the repository, but
+  fixed the output when there are spurious files lying around that
+  contain spaces. For example "pop3 - Copy.c"
   
-  Also note that the output could be optimised a little so global config
-  options are only output once rather than per operation as is presently
-  the case.
+  By including the offending source file in the project files the user
+  can then see the file and remove it if necessary.

 - [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]
 
-  Fix bug that HTTP/2 hangs if whole response body is read with headers
-  
-  For HTTP/2, we may read up everything including responde body with
-  header fields in Curl_http_readwrite_headers. If no content-length is
-  provided, curl waits for the connection close, which we emulate it
-  using conn->proto.httpc.closed = TRUE. The thing is if we read
-  everything, then http2_recv won't be called and we cannot signal the
-  HTTP/2 stream has closed. As a workaround, we return nonzero from
-  data_pending to call http2_recv.

+- handler: make 'protocol' always specified as a single bit
+  
+  This makes the findprotocol() function work as intended so that libcurl
+  can properly be restricted to not support HTTP while still supporting
+  HTTPS - since the HTTPS handler previously set both the HTTP and HTTPS
+  bits in the protocol field.
   
-  In addition to adding support for URL specific options via the command
-  line with --next it is now possible to specify "next" in .curlrc.
-
-- tool: Reworked argument parsing to use --next/-:
+  This fixes --proto and --proto-redir for most SSL protocols.
   
-  Follow up to commit 1a9b58fcb2 to replace the : command line option
-  with --next and -:.
-
-- tool_getparam: Added initial support for --next/-:
+  This is done by adding a few new convenience defines that groups HTTP
+  and HTTPS, FTP and FTPS etc that should then be used when the code wants
+  to check for both protocols at once. PROTO_FAMILY_[protocol] style.
   
-  Added initial support for --next/-: which will be used to replace the
-  rather confusing : command line operation what was used for the URL
-  specific options prototype.

+Daniel Stenberg (22 Apr 2014)
+- configure: use the nghttp2 path correctly with pkg-config
   
-  Side-effect of this change:
-   SChannel and CryptoAPI do not support the iPAddress subjectAltName
-   according to RFC 2818. If present, SChannel will first compare the
-   IP address to the dNSName subjectAltNames and then fallback to the
-   most specific Common Name in the Subject field of the certificate.
+  When --with-nghttp2 was used (without a given path), the
+  PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR varialbe could get clobbered and ruin a proper
+  detection of the library.
   
-   This means that after this change curl will not connect to SSL/TLS
-   hosts as long as the IP address is not specified in the SAN or CN
-   of the server certificate or the verifyhost option is disabled.

-  http2: Support HTTP POST/PUT
-  
-  This patch enables HTTP POST/PUT in HTTP2.
-  We disabled Expect header field and  chunked transfer encoding
-  since HTTP2 forbids them.
-  In HTTP1, Curl sends small upload data with request headers, but
-  HTTP2 requires upload data must be in DATA frame separately.
-  So we added some conditionals to achieve this.

+- curl_easy_setopt: fix wrong version number references
 
-- testsuite: use binary output mode for custom curl test tools
-  
-  Do not try to convert line-endings to CRLF on Windows by setting stdout
-  to binary mode, just like the curl tool does if --ascii is not specified.
-  
-  This should prevent corrupted stdout line-ending output like CRCRLF.
+- docs: this is for 7.37.0
   
-  In order to make the previously naive text-aware tests work with
-  binary mode on Windows, text-mode is disabled for them if it is not
-  actually part of the test case and line-endings are corrected.
+  And clarify for curl that --proxy-header now must be used for headers
+  that are meant for a proxy, and they will not be included if the request
+  is not for a proxy.
 
-- testsuite: changed HTTP and RTSP header line-endings to CRLF
+- PROXYHEADER: send these headers in "normal" proxy requests too
   
-  According to RFC 2616 and RFC 2326 individual protocol elements, like
-  headers and except the actual content, are terminated by using CRLF.
+  Updated the docs to clarify and the code accordingly, with test 1528 to
+  verify:
   
-  Therefore the test data files for these protocols need to contain
-  mixed line-endings if the actual protocol elements use CRLF while
-  the file uses LF.

-Daniel Stenberg (14 Feb 2014)
-- [Colin Hogben brought this change]
+  When CURLHEADER_SEPARATE is set and libcurl is asked to send a request

-- valgrind: added suppression on optimized code
-  
-  gcc 4.7.2 with -O2 will optimize Curl_connect by inlining some

-  a gcc strlen optimization when compiling libidn; compiling it with

+  
+  For example:

-  100-continue: fix timeout condition
-  
-  When using the multi socket interface, libcurl calls the
-  curl_multi_timer_callback asking to be woken up after
-  CURL_TIMEOUT_EXPECT_100 milliseconds.
-  
-  After the timeout has expired, calling curl_multi_socket_action with
-  CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT as sockfd leads libcurl to check expired
-  timeouts. When handling the 100-continue one, the following check in
-  Curl_readwrite() fails if exactly CURL_TIMEOUT_EXPECT_100 milliseconds
-  passed since the timeout has been set!
+- smtp: Fixed login denied when server doesn't support AUTH capability
   
-  It seems logical to consider that having waited for exactly
-  CURL_TIMEOUT_EXPECT_100 ms is enough.
+  Specifying user credentials when the SMTP server doesn't support
+  authentication would cause curl to display "No known authentication
+  mechanisms supported!" and return CURLE_LOGIN_DENIED.

-  HTTP2: add layer between existing http and socket(TLS) layer
+  polarssl: avoid extra newlines in debug messages
   
-  This patch chooses different approach to integrate HTTP2 into HTTP curl
-  stack. The idea is that we insert HTTP2 layer between HTTP code and
-  socket(TLS) layer. When HTTP2 is initialized (either in NPN or Upgrade),
-  we replace the Curl_recv/Curl_send callbacks with HTTP2's, but keep the
-  original callbacks in http_conn struct. When sending serialized data by
-  nghttp2, we use original Curl_send callback. Likewise, when reading data
-  from network, we use original Curl_recv callback. In this way we can
-  treat both TLS and non-TLS connections.
-  
-  With this patch, one can transfer contents from https://twitter.com and
-  from nghttp2 test server in plain HTTP as well.
-  
-  The code still has rough edges. The notable one is I could not figure
-  out how to call nghttp2_session_send() when underlying socket is
-  writable.

-  no previous prototype for function 'memory_tracking_init'

+  
+  In some cases, it might happen we have not received yet all data to perform

-- lib1900: make the test pass the OOM torture tests
+  Fix bug that HTTP/2 hangs if whole response body is read with headers
+  
+  For HTTP/2, we may read up everything including responde body with
+  header fields in Curl_http_readwrite_headers. If no content-length is
+  provided, curl waits for the connection close, which we emulate it
+  using conn->proto.httpc.closed = TRUE. The thing is if we read
+  everything, then http2_recv won't be called and we cannot signal the
+  HTTP/2 stream has closed. As a workaround, we return nonzero from
+  data_pending to call http2_recv.

+- [naota brought this change]
 
-- sockfilt.c: fixed and simplified Windows select function
-  
-  Since the previous complex select function with initial support for
-  non-socket file descriptors, did not actually work correctly for
-  Console handles, this change simplifies the whole procedure by using
-  an internal waiting thread for the stdin console handle.
-  
-  The previous implementation made it continuously trigger for the stdin
-  handle if it was being redirected to a parent process instead of
-  an actual Console input window.
-  
-  This approach supports actual Console input handles as well as
-  anonymous Pipe handles which are used during input redirection.
+  configure: Tiny fix to honor POSIX
   
-  It depends on the fact that ReadFile supports trying to read zero bytes
-  which makes it wait for the handle to become ready for reading.
+  Change "==" to "=" to honor POSIX test construction.
 
-- http_pipe.py: replaced epoll with select to support Windows

-  Removed Unix-specific functionality in order to support Windows:
-  - select.epoll replaced with select.select

-  - socket.MSG_DONTWAIT replaced with socket.setblocking(False)
+Steve Holme (25 Feb 2014)

-  Even though epoll has a better performance and improved socket handling
-  than select, this change should not affect the actual test case.

-  This prevents sending a `Content-Length: -1` header, e.g this ocurred

-  * standard HTTP POST (no chunked encoding),
-  * user-defined read function set,
-  * `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE(_LARGE)` NOT set.

-  with 32-bit Windows builds.
+  To help assist with the detection of incorrect return codes, as per
+  commits ee23d13a79, 33b8960dc8 and aba98991a5, updated the operate
+  based functions to return CURLcode error codes.
 
-- tool: Fixed incorrect return code if command line parser runs out of memory
+- tool: Fixed incorrect return code when setting HTTP request fails
   
-  In the rare instance where getparameter() may return PARAM_NO_MEM whilst
-  parsing a URL, cURL would return this error code, which is equivalent to
-  CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_FAILED in cURL error codes terms.
+  During initialisation SetHTTPrequest() may fail and cURL would return
+  PARAM_BAD_USE, which is equivalent to CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN in cURL error
+  terms.
   
-  Instead, return CURLE_FAILED_INIT and output the failure reason as per
-  the other usage of getparameter().
+  Instead, return CURLE_FAILED_INIT as we do for other functions that may
+  fail during initialisation.

-  Currently, the progress bar is updated at 5Hz. Because it is often not

-  This patch fixes this by always updating the progress bar (instead of

 The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed description in
 RFC 3986.
 
 You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within
 braces as in:
 
- http://site.{one,two,three}.com
+  http://site.{one,two,three}.com
 
 or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:
 
- ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
- ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)
- ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt

+
+  ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)
+
+  ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt
 
 Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each
 other:
 
- http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html
+  http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html
 
 You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched
 in a sequential manner in the specified order.
 
 You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or
 letter:
 
- http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt
- http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt
+  http://www.numericals.com/file[1-100:10].txt
+
+  http://www.letters.com/file[a-z:2].txt
+
+When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt, you
+probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the shell from
+interfering with it. This also goes for other characters treated special, like
+for example '&', '?' and '*'.
 
 If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to guess what
 protocol you might want. It will then default to HTTP but try other protocols
 based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for host names starting
 with "ftp." curl will assume you want to speak FTP.

                           libcurl's binary interface
 
 ABI - Application Binary Interface
+----------------------------------
 
-  First, allow me to define the word for this context: ABI describes the
-  low-level interface between an application program and a library. Calling
-  conventions, function arguments, return values, struct sizes/defines and
-  more.
+  "ABI" describes the low-level interface between an application program and a
+  library. Calling conventions, function arguments, return values, struct
+  sizes/defines and more.
 
-  For a longer description, see
-  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface
+  [Wikipedia has a longer description](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)
 
 Upgrades
+--------
 
   In the vast majority of all cases, a typical libcurl upgrade does not break
   the ABI at all. Your application can remain using libcurl just as before,
   only with less bugs and possibly with added new features. You need to read
   the release notes, and if they mention an ABI break/soname bump, you may
   have to verify that your application still builds fine and uses libcurl as
   it now is defined to work.
 
 Version Numbers
+---------------
 
   In libcurl land, you really can't tell by the libcurl version number if that
   libcurl is binary compatible or not with another libcurl version.
 
 Soname Bumps
+------------
 
   Whenever there are changes done to the library that will cause an ABI
   breakage, that may require your application to get attention or possibly be
   changed to adhere to new things, we will bump the soname. Then the library
   will get a different output name and thus can in fact be installed in
   parallel with an older installed lib (on most systems). Thus, old
   applications built against the previous ABI version will remain working and
   using the older lib, while newer applications build and use the newer one.
 
   During the first seven years of libcurl releases, there have only been four
   ABI breakages.
 
+  We are determined to bump the SONAME as rarely as possible.  Ideally, we
+  never do it again.
+
 Downgrades
+----------
 
   Going to an older libcurl version from one you're currently using can be a
   tricky thing. Mostly we add features and options to newer libcurls as that
   won't break ABI or hamper existing applications. This has the implication
   that going backwards may get you in a situation where you pick a libcurl
   that doesn't support the options your application needs. Or possibly you
   even downgrade so far so you cross an ABI break border and thus a different
   soname, and then your application may need to adapt to the modified ABI.
 
 History
+-------
 
   The previous major library soname number bumps (breaking backwards
   compatibility) have happened the following times:

 Occasionally you may get your progress callback or header callback called from

 connection and the protocol is of a kind that requires a command/response
 sequence before disconnect. Examples of such protocols are FTP, POP3 and IMAP.

-initializes curl and this call \fBMUST\fP have a corresponding call to
+handle that you must use as input to other functions in the easy

-If you did not already call \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP,
-\fIcurl_easy_init(3)\fP does it automatically.
-This may be lethal in multi-threaded cases, since \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP is
-not thread-safe, and it may result in resource problems because there is
-no corresponding cleanup.
-
-You are strongly advised to not allow this automatic behaviour, by
-calling \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP yourself properly.
-See the description in \fBlibcurl\fP(3) of global environment
-requirements for details of how to use this function.

 curl_easy_setopt \- set options for a curl easy handle
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLoption option, parameter);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-curl_easy_setopt() is used to tell libcurl how to behave. By using the
-appropriate options to \fIcurl_easy_setopt\fP, you can change libcurl's
-behavior.  All options are set with the \fIoption\fP followed by a
-\fIparameter\fP. That parameter can be a \fBlong\fP, a \fBfunction pointer\fP,
-an \fBobject pointer\fP or a \fBcurl_off_t\fP, depending on what the specific
-option expects. Read this manual carefully as bad input values may cause
-libcurl to behave badly!  You can only set one option in each function call. A
-typical application uses many curl_easy_setopt() calls in the setup phase.
+\fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP is used to tell libcurl how to behave. By setting
+the appropriate options, the application can change libcurl's behavior.  All
+options are set with an \fIoption\fP followed by a \fIparameter\fP. That
+parameter can be a \fBlong\fP, a \fBfunction pointer\fP, an \fBobject
+pointer\fP or a \fBcurl_off_t\fP, depending on what the specific option
+expects. Read this manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl to
+behave badly!  You can only set one option in each function call. A typical
+application uses many \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP calls in the setup phase.
 
 Options set with this function call are valid for all forthcoming transfers
 performed using this \fIhandle\fP.  The options are not in any way reset
 between transfers, so if you want subsequent transfers with different options,
 you must change them between the transfers. You can optionally reset all
 options back to internal default with \fIcurl_easy_reset(3)\fP.
 
 Strings passed to libcurl as 'char *' arguments, are copied by the library;
 thus the string storage associated to the pointer argument may be overwritten
-after curl_easy_setopt() returns. The only exception to this rule is really
-\fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP, but the alternative that copies the string
+after \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP returns. The only exception to this rule is
+really \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP, but the alternative that copies the string
 \fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP has some usage characteristics you need to
 read up on.
 
 Before version 7.17.0, strings were not copied. Instead the user was forced
 keep them available until libcurl no longer needed them.

+handle from the multi stack again, it is perfectly fine to use it with the
+easy interface again.
 
 If the easy handle is not set to use a shared (\fICURLOPT_SHARE(3)\fP) or
 global DNS cache (\fICURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE(3)\fP), it will be made to
 use the DNS cache that is shared between all easy handles within the multi
 handle when \fIcurl_multi_add_handle(3)\fP is called.
 
+When an easy interface is added to a multi handle, it will use a shared
+connection cache owned by the multi handle. Removing and adding new easy

+connection re-use.
+
 If you have CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION set in the multi handle (and you really
 should if you're working event-based with \fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP
 and friends), that callback will be called from within this function to ask
 for an updated timer so that your main event loop will get the activity on
 this handle to get started.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 This function extracts file descriptor information from a given multi_handle.
 libcurl returns its fd_set sets. The application can use these to select() on,
 but be sure to FD_ZERO them before calling this function as
 \fIcurl_multi_fdset(3)\fP only adds its own descriptors, it doesn't zero or
-otherwise remove any others. The \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP function should be
-called as soon as one of them is ready to be read from or written to.

+be called as soon as one of them is ready to be read from or written to.
+
+If the \fIread_fd_set\fP argument is not a null pointer, it points to an
+object of type fd_set that on returns specifies the file descriptors to be
+checked for being ready to read.
+
+If the \fIwrite_fd_set\fP argument is not a null pointer, it points to an
+object of type fd_set that on return specifies the file descriptors to be
+checked for being ready to write.
+
+If the \fIexc_fd_set\fP argument is not a null pointer, it points to an object
+of type fd_set that on return specifies the file descriptors to be checked for
+error conditions pending.
 
 If no file descriptors are set by libcurl, \fImax_fd\fP will contain -1 when
-this function returns. Otherwise it will contain the higher descriptor number
+this function returns. Otherwise it will contain the highest descriptor number

 currently does something that isn't possible for your application to monitor

 curl_multi_setopt \- set options for a curl multi handle
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM * multi_handle, CURLMoption option, param);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-curl_multi_setopt() is used to tell a libcurl multi handle how to behave. By
-using the appropriate options to \fIcurl_multi_setopt(3)\fP, you can change
-libcurl's behaviour when using that multi handle.  All options are set with
-the \fIoption\fP followed by the parameter \fIparam\fP. That parameter can be
-a \fBlong\fP, a \fBfunction pointer\fP, an \fBobject pointer\fP or a
-\fBcurl_off_t\fP type, depending on what the specific option expects. Read
-this manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl to behave badly!
-You can only set one option in each function call.
+\fIcurl_multi_setopt(3)\fP is used to tell a libcurl multi handle how to
+behave. By using the appropriate options to \fIcurl_multi_setopt(3)\fP, you
+can change libcurl's behaviour when using that multi handle.  All options are
+set with the \fIoption\fP followed by the parameter \fIparam\fP. That
+parameter can be a \fBlong\fP, a \fBfunction pointer\fP, an \fBobject
+pointer\fP or a \fBcurl_off_t\fP type, depending on what the specific option
+expects. Read this manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl to
+behave badly!  You can only set one option in each function call.
 
 .SH OPTIONS
 .IP CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function matching the \fBcurl_socket_callback\fP
-prototype. The \fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP function informs the
-application about updates in the socket (file descriptor) status by doing
-none, one, or multiple calls to the curl_socket_callback given in the
-\fBparam\fP argument. They update the status with changes since the previous
-time a \fIcurl_multi_socket(3)\fP function was called. If the given callback
-pointer is NULL, no callback will be called. Set the callback's \fBuserp\fP
-argument with \fICURLMOPT_SOCKETDATA\fP.  See \fIcurl_multi_socket(3)\fP for
-more callback details.
+See \fICURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_SOCKETDATA
-Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed to the \fBcurl_socket_callback\fP's
-fourth argument, the userp pointer. This is not used by libcurl but only
-passed-thru as-is. Set the callback pointer with
-\fICURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION\fP.
+See \fICURLMOPT_SOCKETDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_PIPELINING
-Pass a long set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Enabling pipelining on a multi
-handle will make it attempt to perform HTTP Pipelining as far as possible for
-transfers using this handle. This means that if you add a second request that
-can use an already existing connection, the second request will be \&"piped"
-on the same connection rather than being executed in parallel. (Added in
-7.16.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_PIPELINING(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION
-Pass a pointer to a function matching the \fBcurl_multi_timer_callback\fP
-prototype: int curl_multi_timer_callback(CURLM *multi /* multi handle */,
-long timeout_ms /* timeout in milliseconds */, void *userp /* TIMERDATA */).
-This function will then be called when the timeout value
-changes. The timeout value is at what latest time the application should call
-one of the \&"performing" functions of the multi interface
-(\fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP and \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP) - to allow
-libcurl to keep timeouts and retries etc to work. A timeout value of -1 means
-that there is no timeout at all, and 0 means that the timeout is already
-reached. Libcurl attempts to limit calling this only when the fixed future
-timeout time actually changes. See also \fICURLMOPT_TIMERDATA\fP. The callback
-should return 0 on success, and -1 on error. This
-callback can be used instead of, or in addition to,
-\fIcurl_multi_timeout(3)\fP. (Added in 7.16.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_TIMERDATA
-Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed to the
-\fBcurl_multi_timer_callback\fP's third argument, the userp pointer.  This is
-not used by libcurl but only passed-thru as-is. Set the callback pointer with
-\fICURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION\fP. (Added in 7.16.0)
-.IP CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS
-Pass a long. The set number will be used as the maximum amount of
-simultaneously open connections that libcurl may keep in its connection cache
-after completed use. By default libcurl will enlarge the size for each added
-easy handle to make it fit 4 times the number of added easy handles.
-
-By setting this option, you can prevent the cache size from growing beyond the
-limit set by you.
-
-When the cache is full, curl closes the oldest one in the cache to prevent the
-number of open connections from increasing.
-
-This option is for the multi handle's use only, when using the easy interface
-you should instead use the \fICURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS(3)\fP option.
-
-See \fICURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS\fP for limiting the number of active
-connections.
-
-(Added in 7.16.3)
+See \fICURLMOPT_TIMERDATA(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS
-Pass a long. The set number will be used as the maximum amount of
-simultaneously open connections to a single host. For each new session to
-a host, libcurl will open a new connection up to the limit set by
-CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS. When the limit is reached, the sessions will
-be pending until there are available connections. If CURLMOPT_PIPELINING is
-1, libcurl will try to pipeline if the host is capable of it.
-
-The default value is 0, which means that there is no limit.
-However, for backwards compatibility, setting it to 0 when CURLMOPT_PIPELINING
-is 1 will not be treated as unlimited. Instead it will open only 1 connection
-and try to pipeline on it.
-
-(Added in 7.30.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH
-Pass a long. The set number will be used as the maximum amount of requests
-in a pipelined connection. When this limit is reached, libcurl will use another
-connection to the same host (see CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS), or queue the
-requests until one of the pipelines to the host is ready to accept a request.
-Thus, the total number of requests in-flight is CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS *
-CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH.
-The default value is 5.
-
-(Added in 7.30.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE
-Pass a long. If a pipelined connection is currently processing a request
-with a Content-Length larger than CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE, that
-connection will not be considered for additional requests, even if it is
-shorter than CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH.
-The default value is 0, which means that the penalization is inactive.
-
-(Added in 7.30.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE
-Pass a long. If a pipelined connection is currently processing a
-chunked (Transfer-encoding: chunked) request with a current chunk length
-larger than CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE, that connection will not be
-considered for additional requests, even if it is shorter than
-CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH.
-The default value is 0, which means that the penalization is inactive.
-
-(Added in 7.30.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL
-Pass an array of char *, ending with NULL. This is a list of sites that are
-blacklisted from pipelining, i.e sites that are known to not support HTTP
-pipelining. The array is copied by libcurl.
-
-The default value is NULL, which means that there is no blacklist.
-
-Pass a NULL pointer to clear the blacklist.
-
-Example:
-
-.nf
-  site_blacklist[] =
-  {
-    "www.haxx.se",
-    "www.example.com:1234",
-    NULL
-  };
-
-  curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_PIPELINE_SITE_BL, site_blacklist);
-.fi
-
-(Added in 7.30.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL
-Pass an array of char *, ending with NULL. This is a list of server types
-prefixes (in the Server: HTTP header) that are blacklisted from pipelining,
-i.e server types that are known to not support HTTP pipelining. The array is
-copied by libcurl.
-
-Note that the comparison matches if the Server: header begins with the string
-in the blacklist, i.e "Server: Ninja 1.2.3" and "Server: Ninja 1.4.0" can 
-both be blacklisted by having "Ninja" in the backlist.
-
-The default value is NULL, which means that there is no blacklist.
-
-Pass a NULL pointer to clear the blacklist.
-
-Example:
-
-.nf
-  server_blacklist[] =
-  {
-    "Microsoft-IIS/6.0",
-    "nginx/0.8.54",
-    NULL
-  };
-
-  curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_PIPELINE_SERVER_BL, server_blacklist);
-.fi
-
-(Added in 7.30.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL(3)\fP
 .IP CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS
-Pass a long. The set number will be used as the maximum amount of
-simultaneously open connections in total. For each new session, libcurl
-will open a new connection up to the limit set by
-CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS. When the limit is reached, the sessions will
-be pending until there are available connections. If CURLMOPT_PIPELINING is
-1, libcurl will try to pipeline if the host is capable of it.
-
-The default value is 0, which means that there is no limit.

-and try to pipeline on it.
-
-(Added in 7.30.0)
+See \fICURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP
 .SH RETURNS

 .SH NAME
 libcurl-easy \- easy interface overview
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 When using libcurl's "easy" interface you init your session and get a handle
 (often referred to as an "easy handle"), which you use as input to the easy
 interface functions you use. Use \fIcurl_easy_init(3)\fP to get the handle.
@@ -30,16 +30,29 @@
 You continue by setting all the options you want in the upcoming transfer, the
 most important among them is the URL itself (you can't transfer anything
 without a specified URL as you may have figured out yourself). You might want
 to set some callbacks as well that will be called from the library when data
 is available etc. \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP is used for all this.
 
+\fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP is only option you really must set, as otherwise there
+can be no transfer. Another commonly used option is \fICURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)\fP
+that will help you see what libcurl is doing under the hood, very useful when
+debugging for example. The \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP man page has a full index
+of the over 200 available options.
+
+If you at any point would like to blank all previously set options for a
+single easy handle, you can call \fIcurl_easy_reset(3)\fP and you can also
+make a clone of an easy handle (with all its set options) using
+\fIcurl_easy_duphandle(3)\fP.
+
 When all is setup, you tell libcurl to perform the transfer using
 \fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP.  It will then do the entire operation and won't
 return until it is done (successfully or not).
 
 After the transfer has been made, you can set new options and make another
 transfer, or if you're done, cleanup the session by calling
 \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP. If you want persistent connections, you don't
 cleanup immediately, but instead run ahead and perform other transfers using
 the same easy handle.

 \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP like crazy. \fIcurl_multi_fdset(3)\fP offers an
 interface using which you can extract fd_sets from libcurl to use in select()
 or poll() calls in order to get to know when the transfers in the multi stack
 might need attention. This also makes it very easy for your program to wait
 for input on your own private file descriptors at the same time or perhaps

 one of its input arguments, and by reading that you can figure out when all
 the transfers in the multi handles are done. 'done' does not mean

-activity on them. When a socket has the given activity, you call
+\fIcurl_multi_setopt(3)\fP. They are two callback functions that libcurl will

 \fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP specifying which socket and action there
 are.
 
 The CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION callback is called to set a timeout. When that
 timeout expires, your application should call the
 \fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP function saying it was due to a timeout.
+
+This API is typically used with an event-driven underlying functionality (like
+libevent, libev, kqueue, epoll or similar) which which the application
+"subscribes" on socket changes. This allows applications and libcurl to much
+better scale upward and beyond thousands of simultaneous transfers without
+losing performance.
+
+When you've added your initial set of handles, you call
+\fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP with CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT set in the sockfd
+argument, and you'll get callbacks call that sets you up and you then continue
+to call \fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP accordingly when you get activity on
+the sockets you've been asked to wait on, or if the timeout timer expires.

+.SH "The multi Interface"
 The easy interface as described in detail in this document is a synchronous
 interface that transfers one file at a time and doesn't return until it is
 done.
 
 The multi interface, on the other hand, allows your program to transfer
-multiple files in both directions at the same time, without forcing you
-to use multiple threads.  The name might make it seem that the multi
-interface is for multi-threaded programs, but the truth is almost the
-reverse.  The multi interface can allow a single-threaded application
-to perform the same kinds of multiple, simultaneous transfers that
-multi-threaded programs can perform.  It allows many of the benefits
-of multi-threaded transfers without the complexity of managing and
-synchronizing many threads.

+multiple, simultaneous transfers that multi-threaded programs can perform.  It
+allows many of the benefits of multi-threaded transfers without the complexity
+of managing and synchronizing many threads.
+
+To complicate matters somewhat more, there are even two versions of the multi
+interface. The event based one, also called multi_socket and the "normal one"
+designed for using with select(). See the libcurl-multi.3 man page for details
+on the multi_socket event based API, this description here is for the select()
+oriented one.
 
 To use this interface, you are better off if you first understand the basics
 of how to use the easy interface. The multi interface is simply a way to make
 multiple transfers at the same time by adding up multiple easy handles into
 a "multi stack".
 
-You create the easy handles you want and you set all the options just like you
-have been told above, and then you create a multi handle with
-\fIcurl_multi_init(3)\fP and add all those easy handles to that multi handle
-with \fIcurl_multi_add_handle(3)\fP.
+You create the easy handles you want, one for each concurrent transfer, and
+you set all the options just like you learned above, and then you create a
+multi handle with \fIcurl_multi_init(3)\fP and add all those easy handles to
+that multi handle with \fIcurl_multi_add_handle(3)\fP.
 
 When you've added the handles you have for the moment (you can still add new
 ones at any time), you start the transfers by calling
 \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP.
 
-\fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP is asynchronous. It will only execute as little as
-possible and then return back control to your program. It is designed to never
-block.
+\fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP is asynchronous. It will only perform what can be
+done now and then return back control to your program. It is designed to never
+block. You need to keep calling the function until all transfers are
+completed.
 
 The best usage of this interface is when you do a select() on all possible
 file descriptors or sockets to know when to call libcurl again. This also
 makes it easy for you to wait and respond to actions on your own application's
 sockets/handles. You figure out what to select() for by using
 \fIcurl_multi_fdset(3)\fP, that fills in a set of fd_set variables for you
 with the particular file descriptors libcurl uses for the moment.
 
 When you then call select(), it'll return when one of the file handles signal
 action and you then call \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP to allow libcurl to do
 what it wants to do. Take note that libcurl does also feature some time-out
 code so we advise you to never use very long timeouts on select() before you
-call \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP, which thus should be called unconditionally
-every now and then even if none of its file descriptors have signaled
-ready. Another precaution you should use: always call
-\fIcurl_multi_fdset(3)\fP immediately before the select() call since the

 <p class="level0">If you then want to transfer another file, the handle is ready to be used again. Mind you, it is even preferred that you re-use an existing handle if you intend to make another transfer. libcurl will then attempt to re-use the previous connection. 
 <p class="level0">For some protocols, downloading a file can involve a complicated process of logging in, setting the transfer mode, changing the current directory and finally transferring the file data. libcurl takes care of all that complication for you. Given simply the URL to a file, libcurl will take care of all the details needed to get the file moved from one machine to another.

 <p class="level0">The easy interface as described in detail in this document is a synchronous interface that transfers one file at a time and doesn't return until it is done. 
-<p class="level0">The multi interface, on the other hand, allows your program to transfer multiple files in both directions at the same time, without forcing you to use multiple threads.  The name might make it seem that the multi interface is for multi-threaded programs, but the truth is almost the reverse.  The multi interface can allow a single-threaded application to perform the same kinds of multiple, simultaneous transfers that multi-threaded programs can perform.  It allows many of the benefits of multi-threaded transfers without the complexity of managing and synchronizing many threads.

It allows many of the benefits of multi-threaded transfers without the complexity of managing and synchronizing many threads. 
+<p class="level0">To complicate matters somewhat more, there are even two versions of the multi interface. The event based one, also called multi_socket and the "normal one" designed for using with select(). See the libcurl-multi.3 man page for details on the multi_socket event based API, this description here is for the select() oriented one. 
 <p class="level0">To use this interface, you are better off if you first understand the basics of how to use the easy interface. The multi interface is simply a way to make multiple transfers at the same time by adding up multiple easy handles into a "multi stack". 
-<p class="level0">You create the easy handles you want and you set all the options just like you have been told above, and then you create a multi handle with <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_init.html">curl_multi_init</a> and add all those easy handles to that multi handle with <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_add_handle.html">curl_multi_add_handle</a>.

 <p class="level0">When you've added the handles you have for the moment (you can still add new ones at any time), you start the transfers by calling <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform</a>.

+<p class="level0"><a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform</a> is asynchronous. It will only perform what can be done now and then return back control to your program. It is designed to never block. You need to keep calling the function until all transfers are completed. 
 <p class="level0">The best usage of this interface is when you do a select() on all possible file descriptors or sockets to know when to call libcurl again. This also makes it easy for you to wait and respond to actions on your own application's sockets/handles. You figure out what to select() for by using <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_fdset.html">curl_multi_fdset</a>, that fills in a set of fd_set variables for you with the particular file descriptors libcurl uses for the moment. 
-<p class="level0">When you then call select(), it'll return when one of the file handles signal action and you then call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform</a> to allow libcurl to do what it wants to do. Take note that libcurl does also feature some time-out code so we advise you to never use very long timeouts on select() before you call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform</a>, which thus should be called unconditionally every now and then even if none of its file descriptors have signaled ready. Another precaution you should use: always call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_fdset.html">curl_multi_fdset</a> immediately before the select() call since the current set of file descriptors may change when calling a curl function.

 Pass a long. If the parameter equals 1, it tells the library to perform all
 the required proxy authentication and connection setup, but no data transfer,
-and then return. This option is implemented for HTTP, SMTP and POP3.
+and then return.
 
 The option can be used to simply test a connection to a server, but is more
 useful when used with the \fICURLINFO_LASTSOCKET\fP option to
 \fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP as the library can set up the connection and then
 the application can obtain the most recently used socket for special data
 transfers.

 CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS \- have libcurl copy data to POST
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS, char *data);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-Pass a char * as parameter, which should be the full data to post in a HTTP
-POST operation. It behaves as the \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP option, but the
-original data is instead copied by the library, allowing the application to
-overwrite the original data after setting this option.
+Pass a char * as parameter, which should be the full \fIdata\fP to post in a
+HTTP POST operation. It behaves as the \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP option, but
+the original data is instead copied by the library, allowing the application
+to overwrite the original data after setting this option.
 
 Because data are copied, care must be taken when using this option in
 conjunction with \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE(3)\fP or
 \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE(3)\fP: If the size has not been set prior to
 \fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP, the data is assumed to be a zero terminated
 string; else the stored size informs the library about the byte count to
 copy. In any case, the size must not be changed after
 \fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP, unless another \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)\fP or
 \fICURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)\fP option is issued.

 CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY \- ask for names only in a directory listing
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY, long listonly);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to just list the names of files in a
-directory, instead of doing a full directory listing that would include file
-sizes, dates etc. This works for FTP and SFTP URLs.
+For FTP and SFTP based URLs a parameter set to 1 tells the library to list the
+names of files in a directory, rather than performing a full directory listing
+that would normally include file sizes, dates etc.
 
-This causes an FTP NLST command to be sent on an FTP server.  Beware that some
-FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they might not include
-subdirectories and symbolic links.
+For POP3 a parameter of 1 tells the library to list the email message or
+messages on the POP3 server. This can be used to change the default behaviour
+of libcurl, when combined with a URL that contains a message ID, to perform a
+"scan listing" which can then be used to determine the size of an email.
+
+Note: For FTP this causes a NLST command to be sent to the FTP server.  Beware
+that some FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they might not
+include subdirectories and symbolic links.
 
 Setting this option to 1 also implies a directory listing even if the URL
 doesn't end with a slash, which otherwise is necessary.
 
 Do NOT use this option if you also use \fICURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH(3)\fP as it
 will effectively break that feature then.

 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SASL_IR, long enable);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a long. If the value is 1, curl will send the initial response to the
 server in the first authentication packet in order to reduce the number of
-ping pong requests. Only applicable to supporting SASL authentication
-mechanisms and to the IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols.
+ping pong requests. Only applicable to the following supporting SASL
+authentication mechanisms:
+
+* Login
+* Plain
+* GSSAPI
+* NTLM
+* OAuth 2.0
 
 Note: Whilst IMAP supports this option there is no need to explicitly set it,
 as libcurl can determine the feature itself when the server supports the
 SASL-IR CAPABILITY.

 <p class="level0">When using Kerberos V5 authentication with a Windows based server, you should specify the user name part with the domain name in order for the server to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you don't then the initial part of the authentication handshake may fail. 
 <p class="level0">When using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as the user name without the domain name should the server be part of a single domain and forest. 
 <p class="level0">To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and user@example.com respectively.

+curl release scheduling
+=======================
+
+Basics
+------
+
+We do releases every 8 weeks on Wednesdays. If critical problems arise, we can
+insert releases outside of the schedule or we can move the release date - but
+this is very rare.
+
+Each 8 week release cycle is split in two 4-week periods.
+
+- During the first 4 weeks after a release, we allow new features and changes
+  to curl and libcurl. If we accept any such changes, we bump the minor number
+  used for the next release.
+
+- During the second 4-week period we do not merge any features or changes, we
+  then only focus on fixing bugs and polishing things to make a solid coming
+  release.
+
+Coming dates
+------------
+
+Based on the description above, here are some planned release dates (at the
+time of this writing):

 security vulnerabilities should be handled.

 The typical process for handling a new security vulnerability is as follows.
 
 No information should be made public about a vulnerability until it is
 formally announced at the end of this process. That means, for example that a
 bug tracker entry must NOT be created to track the issue since that will make
 the issue public and it should not be discussed on any of the project's public
 mailing lists. Also messages associated with any commits should not make
 any reference to the security nature of the commit if done prior to the public
 announcement.

-Peer SSL Certificate Verification
-=================================
+SSL Certificate Verification
+============================
 
-(NOTE: If libcurl was built with Schannel or Secure Transport support, then
-this does not apply to you. Scroll down for details on how the OS-native
-engines handle SSL certificates. If you're not sure, then run "curl -V" and
-read the results. If the version string says "WinSSL" in it, then it was built
-with Schannel support.)
+SSL is TLS
+----------
+
+SSL is the old name. It is called TLS these days.
+
+
+Native SSL
+----------
+
+If libcurl was built with Schannel or Secure Transport support (the native SSL
+libraries included in Windows and Mac OS X), then this does not apply to
+you. Scroll down for details on how the OS-native engines handle SSL
+certificates. If you're not sure, then run "curl -V" and read the results. If
+the version string says "WinSSL" in it, then it was built with Schannel
+support.
+
+It is about trust
+-----------------
+
+This system is about trust. In your local CA cert bundle you have certs from
+*trusted* Certificate Authorities that you then can use to verify that the
+server certificates you see are valid. They're signed by one of the CAs you
+trust.
+
+Which CAs do you trust? You can decide to trust the same set of companies your
+operating system trusts, or the set one of the known browsers trust. That's
+basically trust via someone else you trust. You should just be aware that
+modern operating systems and browsers are setup to trust *hundreds* of
+companies and recent years several such CAs have been found untrustworthy.
+
+Certificate Verification
+------------------------
 
 libcurl performs peer SSL certificate verification by default.  This is done
 by using CA cert bundle that the SSL library can use to make sure the peer's
 server certificate is valid.
 
-If you communicate with HTTPS or FTPS servers using certificates that are
-signed by CAs present in the bundle, you can be sure that the remote server
-really is the one it claims to be.
-
-Until 7.18.0, curl bundled a severely outdated ca bundle file that was
-installed by default. These days, the curl archives include no ca certs at
-all. You need to get them elsewhere. See below for example.
+If you communicate with HTTPS, FTPS or other TLS-using servers using
+certificates that are signed by CAs present in the bundle, you can be sure
+that the remote server really is the one it claims to be.
 
 If the remote server uses a self-signed certificate, if you don't install a CA
 cert bundle, if the server uses a certificate signed by a CA that isn't
 included in the bundle you use or if the remote host is an impostor
 impersonating your favorite site, and you want to transfer files from this
 server, do one of the following:
@@ -91,35 +114,35 @@
 Neglecting to use one of the above methods when dealing with a server using a
 certificate that isn't signed by one of the certificates in the installed CA
 cert bundle, will cause SSL to report an error ("certificate verify failed")
 during the handshake and SSL will then refuse further communication with that
 server.
 
-Peer SSL Certificate Verification with NSS
-==========================================
+Certificate Verification with NSS
+---------------------------------
 
 If libcurl was built with NSS support, then depending on the OS distribution,
-it is probably required to take some additional steps to use the system-wide CA
-cert db. RedHat ships with an additional module, libnsspem.so, which enables
-NSS to read the OpenSSL PEM CA bundle. This library is missing in OpenSuSE, and
-without it, NSS can only work with its own internal formats. NSS also has a new
-[database format](https://wiki.mozilla.org/NSS_Shared_DB).

+OpenSuSE, and without it, NSS can only work with its own internal formats. NSS
+also has a new [database format](https://wiki.mozilla.org/NSS_Shared_DB).
 
 Starting with version 7.19.7, libcurl automatically adds the 'sql:' prefix to
 the certdb directory (either the hardcoded default /etc/pki/nssdb or the
 directory configured with SSL_DIR environment variable). To check which certdb
 format your distribution provides, examine the default certdb location:
 /etc/pki/nssdb; the new certdb format can be identified by the filenames
 cert9.db, key4.db, pkcs11.txt; filenames of older versions are cert8.db,
 key3.db, secmod.db.

+If libcurl was built with Schannel (Microsoft's native TLS engine) or Secure
+Transport (Apple's native TLS engine) support, then libcurl will still perform
 peer certificate verification, but instead of using a CA cert bundle, it will
 use the certificates that are built into the OS. These are the same
 certificates that appear in the Internet Options control panel (under Windows)
 or Keychain Access application (under OS X). Any custom security rules for
 certificates will be honored.

 types are also forbidden. Libcurl uses enums as vararg procedure tagfields...
 Happily, there is a pragma forcing enums to type "int". The original libcurl
 header files are thus altered during build process to use this pragma, in
 order to force libcurl enums of being type int (the pragma disposition in use
 before inclusion is restored before resuming the including unit compilation).
 
-  Two SSL implementations are available to libcurl on OS/400: QsoSSL which is
-obsolescent, does not support asynchronous I/O and only allows a single SSL
-context within a job, and GSKit that does not suffer from these limitations
-and is able to provide some information about the server certificate.
-  Both implementations of SSL are working on "certificate stores" or keyrings,
-rather than individual certificate/key files. Certificate stores, as weel as
+  Secure socket layer is provided by the IBM GSKit API: unlike other SSL
+implementations, GSKit is based on "certificate stores" or keyrings
+rather than individual certificate/key files. Certificate stores, as well as
 "certificate labels" are managed by external IBM-defined applications.
   There are two ways to specify an SSL context:
 - By an application identifier.
 - By a keyring file pathname and (optionally) certificate label.
   To identify an SSL context by application identifier, use option
 SETOPT_SSLCERT to specify the application identifier.
