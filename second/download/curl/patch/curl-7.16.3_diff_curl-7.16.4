+Version 7.16.4 (10 July 2007)
+
+Daniel S (10 July 2007)
+- Kees Cook notified us about a security flaw
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20070710.html) in which libcurl failed to
+  properly reject some outdated or not yet valid server certificates when
+  built with GnuTLS. Kees also provided the patch.
+
+James H (5 July 2007)
+- Gavrie Philipson provided a patch that will use a more specific error
+  message for an scp:// upload failure.  If libssh2 has his matching
+  patch, then the error message return by the server will be used instead
+  of a more generic error.
+
+Daniel S (1 July 2007)
+- Thomas J. Moore provided a patch that introduces Kerberos5 support in
+  libcurl. This also makes the options change name to --krb (from --krb4) and
+  CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL (from CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL) but the old names are still 
+
+- Song Ma helped me verify and extend a fix for doing FTP over a SOCKS4/5
+  proxy.
+
+Daniel S (27 June 2007)
+- James Housley: Add two new options for the SFTP/SCP/FILE protocols:
+  CURLOPT_NEW_FILE_PERMS and CURLOPT_NEW_DIRECTORY_PERMS. These control the
+  premissions for files and directories created on the remote
+  server. CURLOPT_NEW_FILE_PERMS defaults to 0644 and
+  CURLOPT_NEW_DIRECTORY_PERMS defaults to 0755
+
+- I corrected the 10-at-a-time.c example and applied a patch for it by James
+  Bursa.
+
+Daniel S (26 June 2007)
+- Robert Iakobashvili re-arranged the internal hash code to work with a custom
+  hash function for different hashes, and also expanded the default size for
+  the socket hash table used in multi handles to greatly enhance speed when
+  very many connections are added and the socket API is used.
+
+- James Housley made the CURLOPT_FTPLISTONLY mode work for SFTP directory
+  listings as well
+
+Daniel S (25 June 2007)
+- Adjusted how libcurl treats HTTP 1.1 responses without content-lenth or
+  chunked encoding (that also lacks "Connection: close"). It now simply
+  assumes that the connection WILL be closed to signal the end, as that is how
+  RFC2616 section 4.4 point #5 says we should behave.
+  
 Version 7.16.3 (25 June 2007)
 
 Daniel S (23 June 2007)
 - As reported by "Tro" in http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-06/0161.html and
   http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-06/0238.html, libcurl didn't properly do
   no-body requests on FTP files on re-used connections properly, or at least

 This release includes the following changes:
  
- o added curl_multi_socket_action()
- o deprecated curl_multi_socket()
- o uses less memory in non-pipelined use cases
- o CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES matched transfers assume HTTP 1.0 compliance
- o more than one test harness can run at the same time without conflict
- o SFTP now supports quote commands before a transfer
- o CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS added to curl_multi_setopt()
- o upload resume works for file:// URLs
- o asynchronous name resolves now require c-ares 1.4.0 or later
- o added SOCKS test cases
- o CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS and --ftp-create-dirs now work for SFTP
-   operations as well
+ o added CURLOPT_NEW_FILE_PERMS and CURLOPT_NEW_DIRECTORY_PERMS
+ o improved hashing of sockets for the multi_socket API
+ o ftp kerberos5 support added
 
 This release includes the following bugfixes:
 
- o if2up too long interface name memory leak
- o test case 534 started to fail 2007-04-13 due to the existance of a
-   new host on the net with the same silly domain the test was using
-   for a host which was supposed not to exist.
- o test suite SSL certificate works better with newer stunnel
- o internal progress meter update frequency back to once per second
- o avoid some unnecessary calls to function gettimeofday
- o a double-free in the SSL-layer
- o GnuTLS free of NULL credentials
- o NSS-fix for closing down SSL
- o bad warning from configure when gnutls was selected
- o compilation on VMS 64-bit mode
- o SCP/SFTP downloads could hang on the last bytes of a transfer
- o curl_easy_duphandle() crash
- o curl -V / curl_version*() works even when GnuTLS is used on a system without
-   a good random source
- o curl_multi_socket() not "noticing" newly added handles
- o lack of Content-Length and chunked encoding now requires HTTP 1.1 as well
-   to be treated as without response body
- o connection cache growth in multi handles
- o better handling of out of memory conditions
- o overwriting an uploaded file with sftp now truncates it first
- o SFTP quote commands chmod, chown, chgrp can now set a value of 0
- o TFTP connect timouts less than 5 seconds
- o improved curl -w for TFTP transfers
- o memory leak when failed OpenSSL certificate CN field checking
- o memory leak when OpenSSL failed PKCS #12 parsing
- o FPL-SSL when built with NSS
- o out-of-boundary write in Curl_select()
- o -s/--silent can now be used to toggle off the silence again
- o builds fine on 64bit HP-UX
- o multi interface HTTP CONNECT glitch
- o list FTP root directories when login dir is not root
- o no longer slows down when getting very many URLs on the same command line
- o lock share before decreasing dirty counter
- o no-body FTP requests on re-used connections
+ o adjusted how libcurl treats HTTP 1.1 responses without content-lenth or
+   chunked encoding
+ o fixed the 10-at-a-time.c example
+ o FTP over SOCKS proxy
+ o improved error messages on SCP upload failures
+ o security flaw (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20070710.html) in which libcurl
+   failed to properly reject some outdated or not yet valid server certificates
+   when built with GnuTLS
 
 This release includes the following known bugs:
 
  o see docs/KNOWN_BUGS (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/knownbugs.html)
 
 Other curl-related news:
 
- o PycURL 7.16.2.1 was released: http://pycurl.sf.net/
- o TclCurl 7.16.2 was released:
-   http://personal1.iddeo.es/andresgarci/tclcurl/english/
+ o 
 
 New curl mirrors:
 
- o http://curl.spegulo.be is a new mirror in Belgium

- o http://curl.smudge-it.net is a new mirror in St Louis, MO, USA
- o http://curl.askapache.com is a new mirror in Indiana, USA

 This release would not have looked like this without help, code, reports and
 advice from friends like these:
