-# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
-#
-# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
-# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
-# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
-#
-# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
-# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
-# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
-# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
-# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
-#
-# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
-# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
-# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
-# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
-# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
-#
-# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
-# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
-# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
-# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.
-
-# This is to help aclocal find these macros, as it can't see m4_define.

+Daniel Stenberg (20 Apr 2011)
+- Curl_http_connect: detect HTTPS properly after CONNECT
+  
+  libcurl failed to check the correct struct for HTTPS after CONNECT was
+  issued to the proxy, so it didn't do the TLS handshake and subsequently
+  failed the connection. A regression released in 7.21.5 (introduced
+  around commit 8831000bc07de).
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-04/0134.html

+- Improve MinGW static makefile builds.
+  
+  It is now possible to use any combination of features without
+  having to 1st add makefile targets to the main makefile. The
+  main makefile now passes the 'mingw32-feat1-feat2' as var CFG,
+  and the ./[lib|src]/Makefile.m32 parses the CFG var to determine
+  the features to be enabled.
+
+- Enabled MinGW native Windows IDN build.
+
+- Windows native IDN fixes.
+  
+  changed windows.h include to system header;
+  changed obsolete 2nd check for str_w to str_utf8 in order to catch
+  malloc() failure and avoid a free(NULL);
+  changed calls to GetLastError() to void to kill unsused var compiler
+  warnings;
+  moved one call to GetLastError() into else case so that its only
+  called when WideCharToMultiByte() really fails.
+
+- Windows native IDN fixes.
+  
+  Provide prototype for curl_win32_idn_to_ascii();
+  remove wrong 3rd parameter from curl_win32_idn_to_ascii() call.

+Daniel Stenberg (18 Apr 2011)
+- transfer-encoding: document the options
+  
+  The new libcurl and command line options are now described.
+
+- transfer-encoding: added new option and cmdline
+  
+  Added CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING as the option to set to request Transfer
+  Encoding in HTTP requests (if built zlib enabled). I also renamed
+  CURLOPT_ENCODING to CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING (while keeping the old name
+  around) to reduce the confusion when we have to encoding options for
+  HTTP.
+  
+  --tr-encoding is now the new command line option for curl to request
+  this, and thus I updated the test cases accordingly.
+
+- CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING: now used for transfer encoding too
+
+- TE: do the Connection: header
+  
+  When TE: is inserted in the request, we must add a "Connection: TE" as
+  well to be HTTP 1.1 compliant. If a custom Connection: header is passed
+  in, we must use that and only append TE to it. Test case 1125 verifies
+  TE: + custom Connection:.
+
+- test1124: verify gzip AND chunked transfer-encoding
+
+- TE: rename struct field content_encoding
+  
+  Since this struct member is used in the code to determine what and how
+  to decode automatically and since it is now also used for compressed
+  Transfer-Encodings, I renamed it to the more suitable 'auto_decoding'
+
+- HTTP: add support for gzip and deflate Transfer-Encoding
+  
+  Transfer-Encoding differs from Content-Encoding in a few subtle ways,
+  but primarily it concerns the transfer only and not the content so when
+  discovered to be compressed we know we have to uncompress it. There will
+  only arrive compressed transfers in a response after we have requested
+  them with the appropriate TE: header.
+  
+  Test case 1122 and 1123 verify.
+
+Patrick Monnerat (18 Apr 2011)
+- OS400 pragma comment: replace (date) by (user, __DATE__) to include year.
+
+- Augment RPG binding with "OLDIES" definitions.
+  Fix OS400 LDAP wrappers: strings were non null-terminated.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (18 Apr 2011)
+- curl-config: fix --version
+  
+  curl-config --version didn't output the correct version string (bug
+  introduced in commit 0355e33b5f7b234cf3), and unfortunately the test
+  case 1022 that was supposed to check for this was broken.
+  
+  This change fixes the test to detect this problem and it fixes the
+  output.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3288727

   GnuTLS: make the connection phase non-blocking
   
   When multi interface is used, the SSL handshake is no longer
   blocking when GnuTLS is used.
 
 - krb5_auth: fix my previous change to compile
-
-unknown (16 Apr 2010)
-- OS400 version V5R2M0 not supported anymore by IBM: default target release changed to V5R3M0.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (16 Apr 2010)
-- changelog: GnuTLS fix, no reverse loopkups and fixed GSS detection
-
-- SSL_RECV: EOF is not an error here
-  
-  The recent overhaul of the SSL recv function made this treat a
-  zero returned from gnutls_record_recv() as an error, and this
-  caused our HTTPS test cases to fail. We leave it to upper layer
-  code to detect if an EOF is a problem or not.
-
-- [Paul Howarth brought this change]
-
-  configure: GSSAPI detection on ancient Linux distros
-  
-  On some ancient distributions such as RHEL-3, <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h> needs
-  to be processed after <gssapi/gssapi.h>, but does not include it itself.
-  This patch checks for <gssapi/gssapi.h> first and then includes it
-  in the test for <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h>, resolving the problem.
-  
-  Without the patch, <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h> is "present but cannot be
-  compiled".
-
-- resolvers: no more using AI_CANONNAME
-  
-  No resolver anymore needs to use AI_CANONNAME and do reverse
-  lookups.  We should work hard to avoid having code that relies on
-  it.
-
-- KRB5: use given host name instead of reverse lookup'ed name
-  
-  This code would previously use dns_entry->addr->ai_canonname
-  instead of the given host name, which caused us grief and
-  problems since not all our resolver options do the reverse lookup
-  and I would also guess that it caused problems with KRB5/GSS with
-  virtual name-based hosts. Now the host name from the URL is used.
-
-Dan Fandrich (15 Apr 2010)
-- Remove redundant conditional
-
-- Eliminated an unlikely race condition in some tests.
-  
-  Based on a patch from the FreeBSD ports by Peter Pentchev.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (15 Apr 2010)
-- changelog: prevent needless reverse name lookups
-
-- Curl_ipv4_resolve_r: only set AI_CANONNAME when needed
-  
-  As reported in bug report #2987196, the code for ipv6 already did
-  the setting of this bit correctly so we copied that logic into
-  the Curl_ipv4_resolve_r() function as well. KRB code is the only
-  code we know that might need the cannonical name so only resolve
-  it for such requests!
-
-- IGNORE: files generated by maketgz

-
-Guenter Knauf (13 Apr 2010)
-- added last git commit output for c-ares too.
-
-- changed the git update block to take care of c-ares repo if detected.
-
-- updated timestamp of the script.
-
-- removed obsolete var in gitpull() function
-  no need to create a var - lets just return the status var itself.
-
-- added a cast to silent compiler warning with 64bit systems.
-
-- fixed a path typo in src/Makefile.netware.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (12 Apr 2010)
-- Added text for How To Make a Patch with git
-
-- update the section on timeouts
-  
-  The section that describes how to work with timeouts was
-  misleading and could easily trick users to use the wrong API.
-
-- update URL and cut out wrong info on ipv6
-  
-  c-ares has had its own URL for a while and we should point
-  people to that. It also works with IPv6 since a long time.
-
-- refer to CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION for multi_socket users
-  
-  curl_multi_timeout(3) is simply the wrong function to use
-  if you're using the multi_socket API and this document now
-  states this pretty clearly to help guiding users.
-
-- s/CVS/git
-
-- modified to use the git file, not cvs
-  
-  I've done this blindly, and the last piece that works with ares
-  should possibly be done differently now that c-ares isn't a
-  subtree within the curl tree anymore...
-
-- mention missing test servers for <server>
-
-- FTP quote commands prefixed with '*' now can fail without aborting
-  
-  Prefixing the FTP quote commands with an asterisk really only
-  worked for the postquote actions. This is now fixed and test case
-  227 has been extended to verify.

-.IP CURLOPT_ENCODING
+.IP CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING
 Sets the contents of the Accept-Encoding: header sent in an HTTP request, and
 enables decoding of a response when a Content-Encoding: header is received.
 Three encodings are supported: \fIidentity\fP, which does nothing,
 \fIdeflate\fP which requests the server to compress its response using the
 zlib algorithm, and \fIgzip\fP which requests the gzip algorithm.  If a
 zero-length string is set, then an Accept-Encoding: header containing all
 supported encodings is sent.
 
 This is a request, not an order; the server may or may not do it.  This option
 must be set (to any non-NULL value) or else any unsolicited encoding done by
 the server is ignored. See the special file lib/README.encoding for details.

+request. If the server supports this and so desires, it can respond with the

+Transfer-Encoding differs slightly from the Content-Encoding you ask for with

+#             1. Adjust environment variables at the file beginning
 #             2. Open the Command Prompt window and change directory ('cd')
 #                into the 'lib' folder
 #             3. Add <CYGWIN>/bin folder to the PATH environment variable
 #                For example type 'set PATH=C:/embedded/cygwin/bin;%PATH%'
 #             4. Build the library by typing 'make -f ./Makefile.vxworks'
 #             As a result the libcurl.a should be created in the 'lib' folder.

- o Added --netrc-file
- o Added (new) support for cyassl
- o TSL-SRP: enabled with OpenSSL
- o Added CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION
+ o Added --tr-encoding and CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING
 
 This release includes the following bugfixes:
 
- o nss: avoid memory leak on SSL connection failure
- o nss: do not ignore failure of SSL handshake
- o multi: better failed connect handling when using FTP, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP
- o runtests.pl: fix pid number concatenation that prevented it from killing
-   the correct process at times
- o PolarSSL: Return 0 on receiving TLS CLOSE_NOTIFY alert
- o curl_easy_setopt.3: Removed wrong reference to CURLOPT_USERPASSWORD
- o multi: close connection on timeout
- o IMAP in multi mode does SSL connections non-blocking
- o honours the --disable-ldaps configure option
- o Force setopt constants written by --libcurl to be long
- o ssh_connect: treat libssh2 return code better
- o SFTP upload could stall the state machine when the multi_socket API was
-   used
- o SFTP and SCP could leak memory when used with the multi interface and 
-   the connection was closed
- o Added missing file to repair the MSVC makefiles
- o Fixed detection of recvfrom arguments on Android/bionic
- o GSS: handle reuse fix
- o transfer: avoid insane conversion of time_t
- o nss: do not ignore value of CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER in certain cases
- o SMTP-multi: non-blocking connect
- o SFTP-multi: set cselect for sftp and scp to fix "stall" risk
- o configure: removed wrongly claimed default paths
- o pop3: fixed torture tests to succeed
- o symbols-in-versions: many corrections
- o if a HTTP request gets retried because the connection was dead, rewind if
-   any data was sent as part of it
- o only probe for working ipv6 once and then re-use that info for further
-   requests
- o requests that are asked to bound to a local interface/port will no longer
-   wrongly re-use connections that aren't
- o libcurl.m4: Add missing quotes in AC_LINK_IFELSE
- o progress output: don't print the last update on a separate line
- o POP3: the command to send is STLS, not STARTTLS
- o POP3: PASS command was not sent after upgrade to TLS
- o configure: fix libtool warning
- o nss: allow to use multiple client certificates for a single host
- o HTTP pipelining: Fix handling of zero-length responses
- o Don't list NTLM in curl-config when HTTP is disabled
- o curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_RESOLVE typo version
- o OpenSSL: build fine with no-sslv2 versions
- o checkconnection: don't call with NULL pointer with RTSP and multi interface
- o Borland makefile updates
- o configure: libssh2 link fix without pkg-config
- o certinfo crash
- o CCC crash
+ o curl-config: fix --version
+ o curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE clarification
