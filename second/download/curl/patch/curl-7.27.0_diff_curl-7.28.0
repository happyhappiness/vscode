+Version 7.28.0 (10 Oct 2012)
 
-Guenter Knauf (27 Jul 2012)
-- Fixed compiler warning 'unused parameter'.
+Daniel Stenberg (10 Oct 2012)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 8373ca3641
+  
+  One bug, one contributor. Getting ready for release.
 
-- Added prototypes to kill compiler warning.
+- curl_multi_wait: no wait if no descriptors to wait for
+  
+  This is a minor change in behavior after having been pointed out by Mark
+  Tully and discussed on the list. Initially this case would internally
+  call poll() with no sockets and a timeout which would equal a sleep for
+  that specified time.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-10/0076.html
+  Reported by: Mark Tully
 
-- Added --with-winidn to configure.
+- TODO-RELEASE: cleanup for 7.28.0
   
-  This needs another look from the configure experts. I tested that
-  it works so far with MinGW64 cross-compiler; libcurl builds and
-  links fine, but curl not yet ...
+  one issue is now KNOWN_BUG #79
+  
+  the other we just skip since nobody is working on it or is planning to
+  start working on it anytime soon

+- curl_multi_wait.3: style formatting mistake
 
-  Update man page info on --metalink and typo.
+Marc Hoersken (8 Oct 2012)
+- ssluse.c: md5.h is required for Curl_ossl_md5sum
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: remove mentioned of bug never in a release
+Daniel Stenberg (8 Oct 2012)
+- curl_multi_wait.3: fix the name of the man page
+
+- curl_multi_wait.3: renamed the last argument variable for clarity
+
+Marc Hoersken (6 Oct 2012)
+- curl_schannel.c: Fixed caching more data than required
   
-  The --silent bug came with 7561a0fc834c435 which was never in a release.
-  Pointed out by Kamil Dudka
+  Do not fill the decrypted data buffer with more data unless
+  required in order to return the requested amount of data.
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 33b815e894fb
+- curl_schannel: Removed buffer limit and optimized buffer strategy
   
-  4 more bugfixes, 3 more contributors
+  Since there are servers that seem to return very big encrypted
+  data packages, we need to be able to handle those without having
+  an internal size limit. To avoid the buffer growing to fast to
+  early the initial size was decreased and the minimum free space
+  in the buffer was decreased as well.
 
-Guenter Knauf (26 Jul 2012)
-- Changed Windows IDN text to 'WinIDN'.
+- lib/socks.c: Merged two size variables into one
+
+- lib/socks.c: Avoid type conversions where possible
   
-  Synced the output to the same short form as we now use for
-  Windows SSL (WinSSL).
+  Streamlined variable names and types to avoid type conversions that
+  may result in data being lost on non 32-bit systems.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (25 Jul 2012)
-- [Nick Zitzmann brought this change]
+- lib/curl_schannel.c: Hide size_t conversion warning
 
-  darwinssl: fixed freeze involving the multi interface
+- krb5/curl_rtmp.c: Hide size_t to int type conversion warning
+
+- security.c: Aligned internal type to return type
   
-  Previously the curl_multi interface would freeze if darwinssl was
-  enabled and at least one of the handles tried to connect to a Web site
-  using HTTPS. Removed the "wouldblock" state darwinssl was using because
-  I figured out a solution for our "would block but in which direction?"
-  dilemma.
+  Use ssize_t instead of int to avoid conversion problems on 64-bit
+  systems. Also added curlx_sztosi where necessary.
 
-Guenter Knauf (25 Jul 2012)
-- Added support for tls-srp to MinGW builds.
+- lib/curl_schannel: Increased maximum buffer size to factor 128

-- curl_easy_setopt: fix typo
+- winbuild/MakefileBuild.vc: Follow up on 0c8ccf7
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Oct 2012)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 971f5bcedd418
   
-  Reported by: Santhana Todatry
+  9 new bug fixes, 5 changes, 6 more contributors
 
-- keepalive: multiply value for OS-specific units
+- multi_runsingle: CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_* fix for rate limitation
   
-  DragonFly uses milliseconds, while our API and Linux use full seconds.
+  During the periods of rate limitation, the speedcheck function wasn't
+  called and thus the values weren't updated accordingly and it would then
+  easily trigger wrongly once data got transferred again.

-Kamil Dudka (22 Jul 2012)
-- http: print reason phrase from HTTP status line on error
+  Also, the progress callback's return code was not acknowledged in this
+  state so it could make an "abort" return code to get ignored and not
+  have the documented effect of aborting an ongoing transfer.

-- tool_operate: fix misplaced initialization of orig_noprogress
+- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]
+
+  tool_metalink.c: Filtered resource URLs by type
   
-  ... and orig_isatty which caused --silent to be entirely ignored in case
-  the standard output was redirected to a file!
+  In Metalink v3, the type attribute of url element indicates the
+  type of the resource the URL points to. It can include URL to the
+  meta data, such as BitTorrent metainfo file.  In Curl, we are not
+  interested in these meta data URLs. Instead, we are only
+  interested in the HTTP and FTP URLs. This change filters out
+  non-HTTP and FTP URLs. If we don't filter out them, it will be
+  downloaded by curl and hash check will fail if hash is provided
+  and next URL will be tried. This change will cut this useless
+  network transfer.

+  
+  ... in order not to leak memory on initializing an SSL library.
+  
+  Reported by: Tomas Mlcoch
 
-  Client's "qop" value should not be quoted (RFC2617, section 3.2.2).
+Daniel Stenberg (28 Sep 2012)
+- FAQ: remove the date from the topmost line
 
-Guenter Knauf (21 Jul 2012)
-- Fixed typo.
+- FAQ: 5.16 I want a different time-out!
 
-Daniel Stenberg (20 Jul 2012)
-- make: make distclean work again
+- Curl_reconnect_request: clear pointer on failure
   
-  The clean-local hook needed some polish to make sure make distclean
-  works. Added comment describing why.
+  The Curl_reconnect_request() function could end up returning a pointer
+  to a free()d struct when Curl_done() failed inside. Clearing the pointer
+  unconditionally after Curl_done() avoids this risk.

-- test Makefile: only feature 'unit' once in the list of dirs
+- CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT: works without signals or posix too!
 
-Dan Fandrich (20 Jul 2012)
-- Fixed some typos in documentation
+Marc Hoersken (24 Sep 2012)
+- Makefile.vc6: Follow up on 0c8ccf7
 
-Guenter Knauf (20 Jul 2012)
-- Fixed CR issue with Win32 version on MSYS.
+- Makefile.vc6: Added missing default library advapi32.lib
+
+Daniel Stenberg (19 Sep 2012)
+- HTTP_ONLY: disable more protocols
+
+- test2006: Updated expected output to include hash name
   
-  Previous fix didnt work on Linux ...
+  Output changed in commit a34197ef77cb
 
-- Fixed CR issue with Win32 version on MSYS.
+- [Sergei Nikulov brought this change]
 
-- Fixed MSYS <-> Windows path convertion.
+  cmake: use standard findxxx modules for cmake v2.8+
+
+- [Sergei Nikulov brought this change]
+
+  setup.h: fixed for MS VC10 build
   
-  Replaced the Windows real path from mount hack with a more
-  reliable and simpler hack: the MSYS shell has a builtin pwd
-  which understands a -W option which does convertion to Windows
-  paths. Tested and confirmed that this works on all MSYS versions
-  I have back to a 3 year old one.
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3568327
 
-- Follow-up fix to detect SSL libs with MinGW.
+- TODO-RELEASE: push new features to 7.29
   
-  1) the check for winssl needs to come before nss check
-  2) the SSL checks must begin with a new if or else we will
-  never find any SSL lib with MinGW.
+  Leave two bug fixes as possibly fixed for 7.28 but as nobody seems to be
+  working on them I have little hope...
 
-- Tell git to not convert configure-related files.
+Marc Hoersken (17 Sep 2012)
+- metalink tests: Updated expected output to include hash name
 
-- Trial to teach runtests.pl about WinSSL.
+Daniel Stenberg (16 Sep 2012)
+- [Sara Golemon brought this change]
 
-- Fixed warning 'uninitialized value in numeric gt'.
+  curl_multi_wait: Add parameter to return number of active sockets
   
-  This is a MSYS/MinGW-only warning; full warning text is:
-  Use of uninitialized value in numeric gt (>) at ../../curl/tests/runtests.pl line 2227.
+  Minor change to recently introduced function.  BC breaking, but since
+  curl_multi_wait() doesn't exist in any releases that should be fine.

-- multi_runsingle: added precaution against easy_conn NULL pointer
+- http_negotiate.c: Fxied warning: unused variable 'rc'

+- socks.c: Updated error messages to handle hostname and IPv6
+
+- socks.c: Added support for IPv6 connections through SOCKSv5 proxy
+
+Daniel Stenberg (13 Sep 2012)
+- parse_proxy: treat "socks://x" as a socks4 proxy
   
-  In many states the easy_conn pointer is referenced and just assumed to
-  be working. This is an added extra check since analyzing indicates
-  there's a risk we can end up in these states with a NULL pointer there.
+  Selected socks proxy in Google's Chrome browser. Resulting in the
+  following environment variables:
+  
+  NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.0/8
+  ALL_PROXY=socks://localhost:1080/
+  all_proxy=socks://localhost:1080/
+  no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8
+  
+  ... and libcurl didn't treat 'socks://' as socks but instead picked HTTP
+  proxy.

-- getparam: fix the GetStr() macro
+Kamil Dudka (12 Sep 2012)
+- ssh: do not crash if MD5 fingerprint is not provided by libssh2
   
-  It should return PARAM_NO_MEM if the strdup fails. Spotted by
-  clang-analyzer
+  The MD5 fingerprint cannot be computed when running in FIPS mode.

-- Tell git to not convert configure-related files.
+- ssh: move the fingerprint checking code to a separate fnc
 
-Daniel Stenberg (13 Jul 2012)
-- parse_proxy: remove dead assignment
+Marc Hoersken (12 Sep 2012)
+- tool_metalink.c: Added name of validation hash to messages
   
-  Spotted by clang-analyzer
+  This makes it easier to debug broken hashes or hash functions.
 
-- ftp_do_more: add missing check of return code
+- wincrypt: Fixed cross-compilation issues caused by include name
   
-  Spotted by clang-analyzer. The return code was never checked, just
-  stored.
+  For some reason WinCrypt.h is named wincrypt.h under MinGW.
 
-- getinfo: use va_end and cut off Curl_ from static funcs
-  
-  va_end() needs to be used after va_start() and we don't normally use
-  Curl_ prefixes for purely static functions.
+- md5.c: Added support for Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI
 
-- [Philip Craig brought this change]
+- Makefile.m32: Updated to build against libmetalink 0.1.2
+  
+  The include and library path were moved within libmetalink, this
+  patch adjusts the defaults provided within the curl MinGW makefile.
 
-  Split up Curl_getinfo
+- tool_metalink.c: Added support for Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI
   
-  This avoids false positives from clang's scan-build.
+  Since Metalink support requires a crypto library for hash functions
+  and Windows comes with the builtin CryptoAPI, this patch adds that
+  API as a fallback to the supported crypto libraries.
+  It is automatically used on Windows if no other library is provided.
 
-Guenter Knauf (12 Jul 2012)
-- Added error checking for curl_global_init().
+- libntlmconnect.c: Fixed typo and conversion
 
-- Added curl_global_* functions.
+- libntlmconnect.c: Fixed warning: curl_easy_getinfo expects long pointer
+  
+  Fixed tests/libtest/libntlmconnect.c:52: warning: call to
+  '_curl_easy_getinfo_err_long' declared with attribute warning:
+  curl_easy_getinfo expects a pointer to long for this info
 
-- Minor fixes to MinGW makefiles.
+- sws.c: Fixed warning: 'err' may be used uninitialized in this function
 
-Daniel Stenberg (12 Jul 2012)
-- docs: mention CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT
+- libntlmconnect.c: Fixed warning: comparison of signed/unsigned integer
+  
+  Windows does not use -1 to represent invalid sockets and the
+  SOCKET type is unsigned.
 
-Guenter Knauf (12 Jul 2012)
-- Added curl_global_* functions.
+- nss.c: Fixed warning: 'err' may be used uninitialized in this function
 
-Daniel Stenberg (12 Jul 2012)
-- tests: verify the stricter numeric option parser
+- tool_metalink.c: Fixed error: 'O_BINARY' undeclared
   
-  Test 1409 and 1410 verifies the stricter numeric option parser
-  introduced the other day in commit f2b6ebed7b.
+  Check for O_BINARY which is not available on every system.
 
-- SWS: use of uninitialized memory fix
+- tool_metalink.c: Fixed validation of binary files containing EOF
   
-  I made "connmon" not get initialized properly before use, and I use the
-  big hammer and make sure we always clear the entire struct to avoid any
-  problem like this in the future.
+  Since Windows/MinGW threat 0x1A as the EOF character, reading binary
+  files which contain that byte does not work using text mode.
+  The read function will only read until the first 0x1A byte. This
+  means that the hash is not computed from the whole file and the
+  final validation check using hash comparision fails.
 
-- test48: verify that HEAD doesn't close extra
+- winbuild: Added support for building with SPNEGO enabled
   
-  Two commits ago, we fixed a bug where the connction would be closed
-  prematurely after a HEAD. Now I added connection-monitor to test 48 and
-  added a second HEAD and make sure that both are sent over the same
-  connection.
+  Since Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism
+  is already implemented in curl and supported by the MinGW
+  builds, this change adds build support to winbuild makefiles.
+
+- winbuild: Adjusted order of options to generated config name
   
-  This triggered a failure before the bug fix and now works. Will help us
-  avoid a future regression of this kind.
+  Cleaned up order of handled build options by ordering them
+  nearly alphabetically by using the order of the generated
+  config name. Preparation for future/more build options.

+  MANUAL: clarified user+password in HTTP URLs
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 6c6f1f64c2
   
-  This makes verifying easier and makes us more sure curl closes the
-  connection only at the correct point in time. Adjusted test 206 and 1008
-  accordingly and updated the docs for it.
+  6 bug fixes to mention, 5 contributors
 
-- HEAD: don't force-close after response-headers
+- TODO-RELEASE: CURLSSH_AUTH_AGENT and curl_multi_wait() are done
   
-  A HEAD response has no body length and gets the headers like the
-  corresponding GET would so it should not get closed after the response
-  based on the same rules. This mistake caused connections that did HEAD
-  to get closed too often without a valid reason.
+  -321 - CURLSSH_AUTH_AGENT patch by Armel Asselin
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3542731

-- Removed trailing empty strings from awk script.

-- Fixed export list path.
+- mk-ca-bundle: detect start of trust section better
+  
+  Each certificate section of the input certdata.txt file has a trust
+  section following it with details.
+  
+  This script failed to detect the start of the trust for at least one
+  cert[*], which made the script continue pass that section into the next
+  one where it found an 'untrusted' marker and as a result that certficate
+  was not included in the output.

-- test231: fix wrong -C use!
+- [František Kučera brought this change]
 
-- cmdline: parse numerical options stricter
+  SMTP: only send SIZE if supported
   
-  1 - str2offset() no longer accepts negative numbers since offsets are by
-  nature positive.
+  SMTP client will send SIZE parameter in MAIL FROM command only if server
+  supports it. Without this patch server might say "504 Command parameter
+  not implemented" and reject the message.
   
-  2 - introduced str2unum() for the command line parser that accepts
-  numericals which are not supposed to be negative, so that it will
-  properly complain on apparent bad uses and mistakes.

-- test 46: use different path lengths to get reliable sort order
-  
-  Since the order of the cookies is sorted by the length of the paths,

+- symbols-in-versions: new CURL_WAIT_* symbols
 
-- [Christian Hägele brought this change]
+- [Sara Golemon brought this change]
 
-  https_getsock: provided for schannel backend as well
-  
-  The function https_getsock was only implemented properly when USE_SSLEAY
-  or USE_GNUTLS is defined, but it is also necessary for USE_SCHANNEL.
-  
-  The problem occurs when Curl_read_plain or Curl_write_plain returns
-  CURLE_AGAIN. In that case CURL_OK is returned to the multi-interface an
-  the used socket is set to state CURL_POLL_REMOVE and the easy-state is
-  set to CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT. This is fine, because later the socket
-  should be set to CURL_POLL_IN or CURL_POLL_OUT via multi_getsock. That's
-  where https_getsock is called and doesn't return any sockets.

-  Don't try these without mentioned check in place!
+  Avoid showing '(nil)' as hostname in verbose output by making sure the
+  hostname fixup function is called early enough to set the pointers that
+  are used for this. The name data is set again for each request even for
+  re-used connections to handle multiple hostnames over the same
+  connection (like with proxy) or that the casing etc of the host name is
+  changed between requests (which has proven to be important at least once
+  in the past).

+  Test1011 was modified to use a redirect with a re-used a connection
+  since it then showed the bug and now lo longer does. There's currently
+  no easy way to have the test suite detect 'nil' texts in verbose ouputs

-- ssluse.c: fix compiler warning: conversion to 'int' from 'size_t'
+  Curl_socket_check: fix return code for timeout
   
-  Reported by Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa
+  We found a problem with ftp transfer using libcurl (7.23 and 7.25)
+  inside an application which is receiving unix signals (SIGUSR1,
+  SIGUSR2...) almost continuously. (Linux 2.4, PowerPC, HAVE_POLL_FINE
+  defined).
   
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-06/0371.html
+  Curl_socket_check() uses poll() to wait for the socket, and retries it
+  when a signal is received (EINTR). However, if a signal is received and
+  it also happens that the timeout has been reached, Curl_socket_check()
+  returns -1 instead of 0 (indicating an error instead of a timeout).
+  
+  In our case, the result is an aborted connection even before the ftp
+  banner is received from the server, and a return value of
+  CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY from curl_easy_perform() (Curl_pp_multi_statemach(),
+  in pingpong.c, actually returns OOM if Curl_socket_check() fails :-)
+  Funny to debug on a system on which OOM is a possible cause).

-  Metalink: ignore --include if --metalink is used.
+- version bump: start towards next release
   
-  Including headers in response body will break Metalink XML parser.
-  If it is included in the file described in Metalink XML, hash check
-  will fail. Therefore, --include should be ignored if --metalink is
-  used.

-  curl: Restore noprogress and isatty config values.
+Guenter Knauf (26 Jul 2012)
+- Changed Windows IDN text to 'WinIDN'.
   
-  The noprogress and isatty in Configurable are global, in a sense
-  that they persist in one curl invocation. Currently once one
-  download writes its response data to tty, they are set to FALSE
-  and they are not restored on successive downloads.  This change
-  first backups the current noprogress and isatty, and restores
-  them when download does not write its data to tty.
+  Synced the output to the same short form as we now use for
+  Windows SSL (WinSSL).

-  curl: Made --metalink option toggle Metalink functionality
+  darwinssl: fixed freeze involving the multi interface
   
-  In this change, --metalink option no longer takes argument.  If
-  it is specified, given URIs are processed as Metalink XML file.
-  If given URIs are remote (e.g., http URI), curl downloads it
-  first. Regardless URI is local file (e.g., file URI scheme) or
-  remote, Metalink XML file is not written to local file system and
-  the received data is fed into Metalink XML parser directly.  This
-  means with --metalink option, filename related options like -O
-  and -o are ignored.
+  Previously the curl_multi interface would freeze if darwinssl was
+  enabled and at least one of the handles tried to connect to a Web site
+  using HTTPS. Removed the "wouldblock" state darwinssl was using because
+  I figured out a solution for our "would block but in which direction?"

-  When creating metalink_checksum from metalink_checksum_t, first
-  check hex digest is valid for the given hash function.  We do
-  this check in the order of digest_aliases so that first good

-  It updates the two remaining reallocations that have already been there

-  renamed to CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_FREE_SIZE since that is actually what it
-  is now.  Since we don't know how much more data we are going to read
-  during the handshake, CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_FREE_SIZE is used as the

+- multi_runsingle: added precaution against easy_conn NULL pointer

+  darwinssl: output cipher with text, remove SNI warning
   
-  This reverts commit 9c94236e6cc078a0dc5a78b6e2fefc1403e5375e.
+  The code was printing a warning when SNI was set up successfully. Oops.
   
-  It didn't server its purpose, so lets go back to long-time working code.
+  Printing the cipher number in verbose mode was something only TLS/SSL
+  programmers might understand, so I had it print the name of the cipher,
+  just like in the OpenSSL code. That'll be at least a little bit easier
+  to understand. The SecureTransport API doesn't have a method of getting
+  a string from a cipher like OpenSSL does, so I had to generate the

+  schannel: Implement new buffer size strategy
   
-  Verify that the "Saved to filename 'blabla'" message is only displayed when
-  the 'blabla' filename being used _actually_ has been specified by the server
-  in the Content-Disposition header.
+  Increase decrypted and encrypted cache buffers using limitted
+  doubling strategy. More information on the mailinglist:
+  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-06/0255.html
   
-  Use relative path for unintended file creation postcheck.
+  It updates the two remaining reallocations that have already been there
+  and fixes the other one to use the same "do we need to increase the
+  buffer"-condition as the other two.  CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_STEP_SIZE was
+  renamed to CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_FREE_SIZE since that is actually what it
+  is now.  Since we don't know how much more data we are going to read
+  during the handshake, CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_FREE_SIZE is used as the
+  minimum free space required in the buffer for the next operation.
+  CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_STEP_SIZE was used for that before, too, but since
+  we don't have a step size now, the define was renamed.

-- tests: adjust file part behavior in test verify section.
+  Test definition section parts which needed to include xml-lingo as contents
+  of that part required that the xml-blurb was written as a single line. Now the
+  xml-data inside the part can be written multiline making it more readable.
   
-  When a <file> part is now specified with no contents at all, this
-  will actually verify that the specified file has no contents at all.
-  Previously file contents would be ignored.
+  Tested with <client><file> part which is written to disk before <command> runs.

-  mechanism detection to use the CAPA command instead.
+  Make the Schannel implementation use libcurl's default buffer size

-- pop3: Fixed an issue with changes introduced in commit c267c53017bc
-  
-  Because pop3_endofresp() is called for each line of data yet is not
-  passed the line and line length, so we have to use the data pointed to
-  by pp->linestart_resp which contains the whole packet, the mechanisms
-  were being detected in one call yet the function would be called for
-  each line of data.
-  
-  Using curl with verbose mode enabled would show that one line of data
-  would be received in response to the AUTH command, before the AUTH
-  <mechanism> command was sent to the server and then the next few lines
-  of the original AUTH command would be displayed before the response from
-  the AUTH <mechanism> command. This would then cause problems when
-  parsing the CRAM-MD5 challenge data as extra data was contained in the
-  buffer.
+- Win32: downplay MS bazillion type synonyms game
   
-  Changed the parsing so that each line is checked for the mechanisms
-  and the function returns FALSE until the whole of the AUTH response has
-  been processed.
+  Avoid usage of some MS type synonyms to allow compilation with
+  compiler headers that don't define these, using simpler synonyms.

+- Curl_rtsp_parseheader: avoid useless malloc/free
   
-  Due to new features
+  Coverity actually pointed out flawed logic in the previous call to
+  Curl_strntoupper() where the code used sizeof() of a pointer to pass in
+  a size argument. That code still worked since it only needed to
+  uppercase 4 letters. Still, the entire malloc/uppercase/free sequence

-  might want to issue a CAPA command without having to log in as a

+Daniel Stenberg (12 Jun 2012)
+- singlesocket: remove dead code
   
-  Added support for detecting the supported SASL authentication mechanisms
-  via the AUTH command. There are two ways of detecting them, either by
-  using the AUTH command, that will return -ERR if not supported or by
-  using the CAPA command which will return SASL and the list of mechanisms
-  if supported, not include SASL if SASL authentication is not supported
-  or -ERR if the CAPA command is not supported. As such it seems simpler
-  to use the AUTH command and fallback to normal clear text authentication
-  if the the command is not supported.
+  No need to check if 'entry' is non-NULL in a spot where it is already checked
+  and guaranteed to be non-NULL.
   
-  Additionally updated the test cases to return -ERR when the AUTH command
-  is encountered. Additional test cases will be added when support for the
-  individual authentication mechanisms is added.

-
-  Check checksum of downloaded file if checksum is available
-  
-  Metalink file contains several hash types of checksums, such as
-  md5, sha-1, sha-256, etc. To deal with these checksums, I created
-  abstraction layer based on lib/curl_md5.h and
-  lib/md5.c. Basically, they are almost the same but I changed the
-  code so that it is not hash type dependent. Currently,
-  GNUTLS(nettle or gcrypt) and OpenSSL functions are supported.
-  
-  Checksum checking is done by reopening download file.  If there
-  is an I/O error, the current implementation just prints error
-  message and does not try next resource.
+  winbuild: Removed WITH_SSL=schannel and tie schannel to SSPI
   
-  In this patch, the supported hash types are: md5, sha-1 and sha-256.
+  Removed specific WITH_SSL=schannel paramter that did not fit the general
+  schema and complicated the parameters. For now Schannel will be enabled
+  if SSPI is enabled and OpenSSL is disabled.

-  Always create directory hierarchy for Metalink.
-  
-  Filenames contained in Metalink file can include directory information.
-  Filenames are unique in Metalink file, taking into account the directory
-  information. So we need to create the directory hierarchy.
-  
-  Curl has --create-dirs option, but we create directory hierarchy for
-  Metalink downloads regardless of the option value.
-  
-  This patch also put metalink int variable outside of HAVE_LIBMETALINK
-  guard. This reduces the number of #ifdefs.

-  Setting bit 2 for this value was documented as having a constant value
-  defined as CURL_REDIR_POST_303 yet referenced a 302 request.
+  Windows 2000 Professional:  Schannel returns SEC_E_OK instead

+  is zero and the first byte of the encrypted packet is 0x15,
+  the application can safely assume that the message was a
+  close_notify message and change the return value to
+  SEC_I_CONTEXT_EXPIRED.
   
-  Additionally corrected the meaning of CURL_REDIR_POST_ALL for all three
-  bits and fixed problems with the bolding of keywords in this section.
+  Connection shutdown does not mean that there is no data to read
+  Correctly handle incomplete message and ask curl to re-read

-  MAIL FROM or RCPT command was rejected.
-  
-  As such, libcurl would return the wrong result code from performing the
-  operation and additionally set CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE to be that
-  returned by the postdata command.
+  Fixed warning: dereferencing pointer does break strict-aliasing rules
+  by using a union instead of separate pointer variables.
+  Internal union sockaddr_u could probably be moved to generic header.
+  Thanks to Paul Howarth for the hint about using unions for this.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-05/0108.html
-  Reported by: Gokhan Sengun
+  Important for winbuild: Separate declaration of sockaddr_u pointer.
+  The pointer variable *sock cannot be declared and initialized right
+  after the union declaration. Therefore it has to be a separate statement.

-- -# progress meter: avoid superfluous updates and duplicate lines
-  
-  By comparing if a different "progress point" is reached or not since the
-  previous update, the progress function callback for this now avoids many
-  superfluous screen updates. This has the nice side-effect that it fixes
-  a problem that causes a second progress meter line.
-  
-  The second line output happened because when we use the -# progress
-  meter, we force a newline output after the transfer in the main loop in
-  curl, but when libcurl calls the progress callback from
-  curl_easy_cleanup() it would then output the progress display
-  again. Possibly the naive newline output is wrong but this optimization
-  was suitable anyway...

+- pop3.c:Corrected typo in commit 69ba0da8272d
+
+- pop3: Fixed the issue of having to supply the user name for all requests
   
-  NSS_InitContext() was introduced in NSS 3.12.5 and helps to prevent
-  collisions on NSS initialization/shutdown with other libraries.
+  Previously it wasn't possible to connect to POP3 and not specify the
+  user name as a CURLE_ACCESS_DENIED error would be returned. This error
+  occurred because USER would be sent to the server with a blank user name
+  if no mailbox user was specified as the server would reply with -ERR.
   
-  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/738456
+  This wasn't a problem prior to the 7.26.0 release but with the
+  introduction of custom commands the user and/or application developer
+  might want to issue a CAPA command without having to log in as a
+  specific mailbox user.
+  
+  Additionally this fix won't send the newly introduced AUTH command if no
+  user name is specified.

+  Added support for detecting the supported SASL authentication mechanisms

+  using the CAPA command which will return SASL and the list of mechanisms
+  if supported, not include SASL if SASL authentication is not supported
+  or -ERR if the CAPA command is not supported. As such it seems simpler

+  GNUTLS(nettle or gcrypt) and OpenSSL functions are supported.
   
-  This change caused fetching of the certificates to become unreliable.
+  Checksum checking is done by reopening download file.  If there

-  OpenSSL: Made cert hostname check conform to RFC 6125
-  
-  This change replaces RFC 2818 based hostname check in OpenSSL build with
-  RFC 6125 [1] based one.
-  
-  The hostname check in RFC 2818 is ambiguous and each project implements
-  it in the their own way and they are slightly different. I check curl,
-  gnutls, Firefox and Chrome and they are all different.
-  
-  I don't think there is a bug in current implementation of hostname
-  check. But it is not as strict as the modern browsers do. Currently,
-  curl allows multiple wildcard character '*' and it matches '.'. (as
-  described in the comment in ssluse.c).
-  
-  Firefox implementation is also based on RFC 2818 but it only allows at
-  most one wildcard character and it must be in the left-most label in the
-  pattern and the wildcard must not be followed by any character in the
-  label.[2] Chromium implementation is based on RFC 6125 as my patch does.
-  Firefox and Chromium both require wildcard in the left-most label in the
-  presented identifier.
-  
-  This patch is more strict than the current implementation, so there may
-  be some cases where old curl works but new one does not. But at the same
-  time I think it is good practice to follow the modern browsers do and
-  follow the newer RFC.

-- HTTP: reset expected DL/UL sizes on redirects
-  
-  With FOLLOWLOCATION enabled. When a 3xx page is downloaded and the
-  download size was known (like with a Content-Length header), but the
-  subsequent URL (transfered after the 3xx page) was chunked encoded, then
-  the previous "known download size" would linger and cause the progress
-  meter to get incorrect information, ie the former value would remain
-  being sent in. This could easily result in downloads that were WAY
-  larger than "expected" and would cause >100% outputs with the curl
-  command line tool.
-  
-  Test case 599 was created and it was used to repeat the bug and then
-  verify the fix.

+- -# progress meter: avoid superfluous updates and duplicate lines
   
-  The line endings broke when I saved the three recent patches (my fault,
-  not Colin's) to 'git am' them.
+  By comparing if a different "progress point" is reached or not since the
+  previous update, the progress function callback for this now avoids many
+  superfluous screen updates. This has the nice side-effect that it fixes
+  a problem that causes a second progress meter line.
   
-  Adjusted the stripping of the test program for comparing to also exclude
-  the SSH key file name as that will differ and use a local path name.
+  The second line output happened because when we use the -# progress
+  meter, we force a newline output after the transfer in the main loop in
+  curl, but when libcurl calls the progress callback from
+  curl_easy_cleanup() it would then output the progress display
+  again. Possibly the naive newline output is wrong but this optimization
+  was suitable anyway...

-- OpenSSL: don't disable security work-around
-  
-  OpenSSL added a work-around for a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability
-  (http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt). In 0.9.6e they added a bit
-  to SSL_OP_ALL that _disables_ that work-around despite the fact that
-  SSL_OP_ALL is documented to do "rather harmless" workarounds.
-  
-  The libcurl code uses the SSL_OP_ALL define and thus logically always
-  disables the OpenSSL fix.
-  
-  In order to keep the secure work-around workding, the
-  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit must not be set and this change
-  makes sure of this.

+- CONNECT: fix ipv6 address in the Request-Line
   
-  6 more bugfixes, 3 more contributors
-
-- create_hostcache_id: use the key lower cased
+  Commit 466150bc64d fixed the Host: header with CONNECT, but I then
+  forgot the preceeding request-line. Now this too uses [brackets]
+  properly if a ipv6 numerical address was given.
   
-  ... to make sure the DNS cache is properly case insensitive

-- changed case: use new host name for subsequent HTTP requests
+- [Steve Holme brought this change]
+
+  SMTP: Added support for returning SMTP response codes
   
-  When a HTTP connection is re-used for a subsequent request without
-  proxy, it would always re-use the Host: header of the first request. As
-  host names are case insensitive it would make curl send another host
-  name case that what the particular request used.
+  Set the conn->data->info.httpcode variable in smtp_statemach_act() to
+  allow Curl_getinfo() to return the SMTP response code via the
+  CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE action.
+
+- curl.1: updated --libcurl
   
-  Now it will instead always use the most recent host name to always use
-  the desired casing.
+  With Colin Hogben's recent work, --libcurl now also works with -F and
+  more. Remove the previous caveat.
+
+- test: --libcurl fixes
   
-  Added test case 1318 to verify.
+  The line endings broke when I saved the three recent patches (my fault,
+  not Colin's) to 'git am' them.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-12/0314.html
-  Reported by: Alex Vinnik
+  Adjusted the stripping of the test program for comparing to also exclude
+  the SSH key file name as that will differ and use a local path name.
 
-- CURLOPT_RESOLVE: avoid adding already present host names
-  
-  The load host names to DNS cache function was moved to hostip.c and it
-  now makes sure to not add host names that already are present in the
-  cache. It would previously lead to memory leaks when for example using
-  the --resolve and multiple URLs on the command line.

-- runtests.pl: Use logmsg more consistently
+  Add helper script convsrctest.pl to manipulate --libcurl tests.
+  
+  The intention is to take the output of curl's --libcurl option,
+  as exercised in test 14xx, and generate a corresponding test15xx
+  in which the generated code is compiled and run.  This will verify
+  that the generated code behaves equivalently to the original
+  invocation of the curl command.
+  
+  The script is not yet integrated into the configure / makefile
+  machinery.

-- [Alessandro Ghedini brought this change]
+- [Colin Hogben brought this change]
 
-  examples: add a couple of simple pop3s examples
+  Generate lists and use symbols in --libcurl code output.
   
-  These examples show how to fetch a single message (RETR command) and how to
-  list all the messages in a given mailbox (LIST command), with authentication
-  via SSL.
+  This patch improves the output of curl's --libcurl option by
+  generating code which builds curl_httppost and curl_slist lists, and
+  uses symbolic names for enum and flag values.  Variants of the
+  my_setopt macro in tool_setopt.h are added in order to pass extra type
+  information to the code-generation step in tool_setopt.c.

+  Curl_pop3_write() would drop the final CRLF of a message as it was

+
+  smtp.c: Fixed an issue with the EOB checking
   
-  The commit 9dd85bc unintentionally changed the way we compute the time
-  spent waiting for 100-continue.  In particular, when using a SSL client
-  certificate, the time spent by SSL handshake was included and could
-  cause the CURL_TIMEOUT_EXPECT_100 timeout to be mistakenly fired up.

+  SMTP: Fixed error when using CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY
   
-  This function was introduced in commit 5527417afae0 and as pointed out

-  that he had this fixed in his patch as posted in
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-12/0179.html
+  Fixed incorrect behavior in smtp_done() which would cause the end of
+  block data to be sent to the SMTP server if libcurl was operating in

-  CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_FAILED to be set whenever ACCEPTing fails because of

+
+- CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS: added
   
-  CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT to be set whenever ACCEPTing timeouts.
+  Allow an appliction to set libcurl specific SSL options. The first and

-  Neither of these errors are considered fatal and control connection
-  remains OK because it could just be a firewall blocking server to
-  connect to the client.
+  It will make libcurl to disable any work-arounds the underlying SSL

+  This is a reaction to us unconditionally removing that behavior after
+  this security advisory:
   
-  CURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS
+  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124B.html
   
-  It sets the maximum amount of time FTP client is going to wait for a

+  ... it did however cause a lot of programs to fail because of old
+  servers not liking this work-around. Now programs can opt to decrease

+- curl tool: allow glob-loops to abort again upon critical errors
   
-  As commit ce896875f8 fixed a timer that accidentally had been moved in

-  and some others) now verifies 5 timers against each other to verify that

+- curl tool: don't abort glob-loop due to failures
   
-  It makes it easier to introduce debug outputs in this function, and
-  everything in the function is using the value anyway so it might even be
-  more efficient.
-
-- timer: restore PRETRANSFER timing
+  We want to continue to the next URL to try even on failures returned
+  from libcurl. This makes -f with ranges still get subsequent URLs even
+  if occasional ones return error. This was a regression as it used to

-  Regression introduced in 7.23.0 with commit 9dd85bce. The function in

-  Correct substitution var names
+- URL sanitize: reject URLs containing bad data
   
-  Two variable names were wrong in the documentation.
+  Protocols (IMAP, POP3 and SMTP) that use the path part of a URL in a
+  decoded manner now use the new Curl_urldecode() function to reject URLs
+  with embedded control codes (anything that is or decodes to a byte value
+  less than 32).
+  
+  URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and
+  allow users to do unintended actions with otherwise innocent tools and
+  applications. Like for example using a URL like
+  pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get
+  a mail and instead this would delete one.

+  
+  The libcurl code uses the SSL_OP_ALL define and thus logically always

+- win32-threaded-resolver: stop using a dummy socket
   
-  When the new socket is created for an active connection, it is now done

+  Previously the code would create a dummy socket while resolving just to
+  have curl_multi_fdset() return something but the non-win32 version

+  made with the common create-socket callback can be confusing to apps
+  using the multi_socket API etc.
   
-  Test case 596 was modified to run fine, although it hides the fact that
-  the close callback is still called too many times, as it also gets
-  called for closing sockets that were created with accept().
+  This change removes the dummy socket and thus will cause
+  curl_multi_fdset() to return with maxfd == -1 more often.

-  the error is CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT (28) which is a generic timeout
-  error without specificly saying for which connection it concerns, and
-  for timeouts libcurl marks the control channel as "invalid". As this
-  test case times out for the data connection it could still use the
-  control channel.

-Yang Tse (25 Nov 2011)
-- CyaSSL 2.0+ library initialization adjustment
+  The load host names to DNS cache function was moved to hostip.c and it
+  now makes sure to not add host names that already are present in the
+  cache. It would previously lead to memory leaks when for example using
+  the --resolve and multiple URLs on the command line.

-- symbols.pl: provide LIBCURL_HAS macro for apps
+Kamil Dudka (25 Dec 2011)
+- transfer: avoid unnecessary timeout event when waiting for 100-continue
   
-  Experience has shown that the symbols-in-versions file is very useful to
-  applications that want to build with a wide range of libcurl versions.
-  It is however easy to get it wrong and the source gets a bit messy with
-  all the fixed numerical comparisions.
+  The commit 9dd85bc unintentionally changed the way we compute the time
+  spent waiting for 100-continue.  In particular, when using a SSL client
+  certificate, the time spent by SSL handshake was included and could
+  cause the CURL_TIMEOUT_EXPECT_100 timeout to be mistakenly fired up.
   
-  The point of this script is to provide an easy-to-use macro for libcurl-
-  using applications to do preprocessor checks for specific libcurl
-  defines, and yet make the code clearly show what the macro is used for.

-  HTTP auth: fix proxy Negotiate bug
+  curl.h: add __ANDROID__ macro check
   
-  If a proxy offers several Authentication schemes where NTLM and

-  Negotiate scheme then the request never returns when the proxy answers
-  with its HTTP 407 reply.
+  When working with the Android Standalone Toolchain the compiler defines
+  this macro:
   
-  It is reproducible by the following steps:
+    /path/to/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc -E -dM - < /dev/null \
+    | grep -i android
+    #define __ANDROID__ 1
   
-  - Use a proxy that offers NTLM and Negotiate ( CURLOPT_PROXY and
-  CURLOPT_PROXYPORT )
+  We really need to check both ANDROID and __ANDROID__ since I've observed
+  that:
   
-  - Tell libcurl NOT to use Negotiate CURL_EASY_SETOPT(CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH,
-  CURLAUTH_BASIC | CURLAUTH_DIGEST | CURLAUTH_NTLM )
+  * if you use Android.mk file(s) and the 'ndk-build' script (aka vanilla
+  way), ANDROID is predefined (see -DANDROID extra C flag),
   
-  - Start the request

+- lib500: verify timers relative each other
   
-  The call to CURL_EASY_PERFORM never returns. If you switch on debug
-  logging you can see that libcurl issues a new request As soon as it
-  received the 407 reply. Instead it should return and set the response
-  code to 407.
+  As commit ce896875f8 fixed a timer that accidentally had been moved in
+  code and then returned a bad timer, the lib500.c code (used in test 500
+  and some others) now verifies 5 timers against each other to verify that
+  they have the correct relative values. We cannot compare against
+  absolute values as the timings will vary a lot.

+  CURLOPT_INTERFACE: avoid resolving interfaces names
   
-  NODATACONN: applies to both active and passive FTP modes, instructs server
-  to not establish nor accept a data channel and fool client into believing
-  that the data channel connection is possible.
+  Do not try to resolve interfaces names via DNS by recognizing interface
+  names in a few ways.  If the interface option argument has a prefix of
+  "if!" then treat the argument as only an interface.  Similarly, if the
+  interface argument is the name of an interface (even if it does not have
+  an IP address assigned), treat it as an interface name.  Finally, if the
+  interface argument is prefixed by "host!" treat it as a hostname that
+  must be resolved by /etc/hosts or DNS.
   
-  Some polishing probably required.
+  These changes allow a client using the multi interfaces to avoid
+  blocking on name resolution if the interface loses its IP address or
+  disappears.

+- create_conn: don't switch to HTTP protocol if tunneling is enabled
   
-  When the multi state is changed within the multi_runsingle from DOING to
-  DO_MORE, we didn't immediately start the FTP state machine again. That
-  then left the FTP state in FTP_STOP. When curl_multi_fdset() was
-  subsequently called, the ftp_domore_getsock() function would return the

+  This is a regression since who knows when. When spotting that a HTTP

+  since if we do tunneling through the proxy we're still using the target
+  protocol.

-  disabled. All other existing active FTP port tests strip out the port

+Dan Fandrich (6 Dec 2011)
+- Added some include files in a couple of example programs

-- curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
-  
-  After a PORT has been issued, and the multi handle would switch to the
-  CURLM_STATE_DO_MORE state (which is unique for FTP), libcurl would
-  return the wrong fdset to wait for when curl_multi_fdset() is
-  called. The code would blindly assume that it was waiting for a connect
-  of the second connection, while that isn't true immediately after the
-  PORT command.
+- SSH: fix CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_MD5
   
-  Also, the function multi.c:domore_getsock() was highly FTP-centric and
-  therefore ugly to keep in protocol-agnostic code. I solved this problem
-  by introducing a new function pointer in the Curl_handler struct called
-  domore_getsock() which is only called during the DOMORE state for
-  protocols that set that pointer.
+  When a 32 digit hex key is given as a hostkey md5 checksum, the code
+  would still run it against the knownhost check and not properly
+  acknowledge that the md5 should then be the sole guide for.
   
-  The new ftp.c:ftp_domore_getsock() function now returns fdset info about
-  the control connection's command/response handling while such a state is
-  in use, and goes over to waiting for a writable second connection first
-  once the commands are done.
+  The verbose output now includes the evaluated MD5 hostkey checksum.
   
-  The original problem could be seen by running test 525 and checking the
-  time stamps in the FTP server log. I can verify that this fix at least
-  fixes this problem.
+  Some related source code comments were also updated.

-  smtp: Added support for NTLM authentication
-  
-  Modified smtp_endofresp() to detect NTLM from the server specified list
-  of supported authentication mechanisms.
-  
-  Modified smtp_authenticate() to start the sending of the NTLM data.
-  
-  Added smtp_auth_ntlm_type1_message() which creates a NTLM type-1
-  message. This function is used by authenticate() to start the sending
-  of data and by smtp_state_auth_ntlm_resp() when the AUTH command
-  doesn't contain the type-1 message as part of the initial response.
-  This lack of initial response can happen if an OOM error occurs or the
-  type-1 message is longer than 504 characters. As the main AUTH command
-  is limited to 512 character the data has to be transmitted in two
-  parts; one containing the AUTH NTLM and the second containing the
-  type-1 message.
-  
-  Added smtp_state_auth_ntlm_type2msg_resp() which handles the incoming
-  type-2 message and sends an outgoing type-3 message. This type-2
-  message is sent by the server in response to our type-1 message.
+  TELNET: improved treatment of options
   
-  Modified smtp_state_auth_resp() to handle the response to: the AUTH
-  NTLM without the initial response and the type-2 response.
+  1) enables the Window Size option
+  2) allows the server to enable the echo mode
+  3) allows an app using libcurl to disable the default binary mode
   
-  Modified smtp_disconnect() to cleanup the NTLM SSPI stack.

-  Added the output message length as a parameter to both
-  Curl_ntlm_create_type1_message() and Curl_ntlm_create_type3_message()
-  for use by future functions that require it.
+  By setting PROTOPT_NOURLQUERY in the protocol handler struct, the

-  Changed the name of variable l, in several functions, which represents
-  the length of strings being sent to the server, to len which is more
-  meaningful and consistent with other code in smtp.c and elsewhere.
+  Experience has shown that the symbols-in-versions file is very useful to
+  applications that want to build with a wide range of libcurl versions.
+  It is however easy to get it wrong and the source gets a bit messy with
+  all the fixed numerical comparisions.
   
-  Reworked smtp_authenticate() to be simpler and easier to follow.
-  Variables and now initialised in their definitions and if no username
-  and password are specified the function sets the state to SMTP_STOP and
-  returns immediately, rather than being part of a huge if statement.
+  The point of this script is to provide an easy-to-use macro for libcurl-
+  using applications to do preprocessor checks for specific libcurl
+  defines, and yet make the code clearly show what the macro is used for.

+- runtests.pl: running server checks - commit 3676ec96 follow-up
+  
+  Fix called sub when checking TFTP server, and adjust message.
 
-  CURLOPT_URL: Expanded URL description
+- runtests.pl: running server checks - commit 4464583a follow-up
   
-  Expanded the section about CURLOPT_URL to include the format of the URL
-  and detailed information and examples relating to specific protocols.
+  Extended server checks to others in addition to pingpong when torture testing.
 
-- [Steve Holme brought this change]
+- lib589.c: add CURLOPT_READDATA missing stuff
 
-  Curl_gethostname: return un-qualified machine name
+- ftpserver.pl: three new custom FTP server commands to disable data channel
   
-  Fixed Curl_gethostname() so that it always returns the un-qualified
-  machine name rather than being dependent on the socket provider.
+  NODATACONN421: applies only to active FTP mode, instructs server to not
+  establish data connection back to client and reply with FTP 421.
   
-  Note: The return of getenv("CURL_GETHOSTNAME") is also parsed in case
-  the developer / test harness provided a fully qualified domain name as
-  it's value as well.

-- curl tool: create tool_myfunc.[ch] which later on will hold my_* functions
+  NODATACONN425: applies only to active FTP mode, instructs server to not
+  establish data connection back to client and reply with FTP 425.
+  
+  NODATACONN: applies to both active and passive FTP modes, instructs server
+  to not establish nor accept a data channel and fool client into believing
+  that the data channel connection is possible.
   
-  Additionally function my_useragent() now provides default User-Agent string
+  Some polishing probably required.
 
-- curl tool: reorder free_config_fields() field handling
+- multi.c: OOM handling fix
   
-  Reorder handling of fields to match same order as the one given by current
-  definition order of 'Configurable' struct fields. Fields currently not handled
-  marked for further inspection.
+  Fix curl_multi_cleanup() segfault when using weird cleanup sequence.

-- Fixed MinGW WinIDN lib dependency.
+Daniel Stenberg (27 Oct 2011)
+- multi: start ftp state machine when switching to DO_MORE
+  
+  This extends the fix from commit d7934b8bd491
+  
+  When the multi state is changed within the multi_runsingle from DOING to
+  DO_MORE, we didn't immediately start the FTP state machine again. That
+  then left the FTP state in FTP_STOP. When curl_multi_fdset() was
+  subsequently called, the ftp_domore_getsock() function would return the
+  wrong fd info.
+  
+  Reported by: Gokhan Sengun

   The application thus needs to parse the LIST output. One such existing

+
+  Time and time again users realize that CURLOPT_TIMEOUT and
+  CURLOPT_CONNECTIMEOUT are not sufficiently advanced or flexible to cover all
+  the various use cases and scenarios applications end up with.
+
+  libcurl offers many more ways to time-out operations. A common alternative
+  is to use the CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT and CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME options to
+  specify the lowest possible speed to accept before to consider the transfer
+  timed out.
+
+  The most flexible way is by writing your own time-out logic and using
+  CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION (perhaps in combination with other callbacks) and
+  use that to figure out exactly when the right condition is met when the
+  transfer should get stopped.

    Be sure also to strip debugging symbols from your binaries after
    compiling using 'strip' (or the appropriate variant if cross-compiling).
    If space is really tight, you may be able to remove some unneeded
    sections of the shared library using the -R option to objcopy (e.g. the
    .comment section).

 .SH DESCRIPTION
-When the app thinks there's data available for the multi_handle, it should
-call this function to read/write whatever there is to read or write right
-now. curl_multi_perform() returns as soon as the reads/writes are done. This
+This function handles transfers on all the added handles that need attention
+in an non-blocking fashion.
+
+When an application has found out there's data available for the multi_handle
+or a timeout has elapsed, the application should call this function to
+read/write whatever there is to read or write right now etc.
+curl_multi_perform() returns as soon as the reads/writes are done. This
 function does not require that there actually is any data available for
 reading or that data can be written, it can be called just in case. It will
 write the number of handles that still transfer data in the second argument's
 integer-pointer.
 
-When you call curl_multi_perform() and the amount of \fIrunning_handles\fP is
-changed from the previous call (or is less than the amount of easy handles
-you've added to the multi handle), you know that there is one or more
-transfers less "running". You can then call \fIcurl_multi_info_read(3)\fP to
-get information about each individual completed transfer, and that returned
-info includes CURLcode and more. If an added handle fails very quickly, it may
-never be counted as a running_handle.

 .SH "SHARE OBJECT"
 You create a shared object with \fIcurl_share_init(3)\fP. It returns a handle
 for a newly created one.
 
 You tell the shared object what data you want it to share by using
-\fIcurl_share_setopt(3)\fP. Currently you can only share DNS and/or COOKIE
-data.
+\fIcurl_share_setopt(3)\fP.
 
 Since you can use this share from multiple threads, and libcurl has no
 internal thread synchronization, you must provide mutex callbacks if you're
 using this multi-threaded. You set lock and unlock functions with
 \fIcurl_share_setopt(3)\fP too.

 8.1 SSL engine stuff
 
  Is this even possible?
 
 8.3 check connection
 
  Add a way to check if the connection seems to be alive, to correspond to the
  SSL_peak() way we use with OpenSSL.
 
-8.4 non-gcrypt
-
- libcurl assumes that there are gcrypt functions available when
- GnuTLS is.
-
- GnuTLS can be built to use libnettle instead as crypto library,
- which breaks the previously mentioned assumption
-
- The correct fix would be to detect which crypto layer that is in use and
- adapt our code to use that instead of blindly assuming gcrypt.
