+
+  NTLM: Fix ConnectionExists to compare Proxy credentials
+  
+  Proxy NTLM authentication should compare credentials when
+  re-using a connection similar to host authentication, as it
+  authenticate the connection.
+  
+  Example:
+  curl -v -x http://proxy:port http://host/ -U good_user:good_pwd
+    --proxy-ntlm --next -x http://proxy:port http://host/
+      [-U fake_user:fake_pwd --proxy-ntlm]

+
+  curl: avoid local drive traversal when saving file (Windows)
+  
+  curl does not sanitize colons in a remote file name that is used as the
+  local file name. This may lead to a vulnerability on systems where the
+  colon is a special path character. Currently Windows/DOS is the only OS
+  where this vulnerability applies.

+- mbedtls: Fix pinned key return value on fail
+  
+  - Switch from verifying a pinned public key in a callback during the
+  certificate verification to inline after the certificate verification.
+  
+  The callback method had three problems:
+  
+  1. If a pinned public key didn't match, CURLE_SSL_PINNEDPUBKEYNOTMATCH
+  was not returned.
+  
+  2. If peer certificate verification was disabled the pinned key
+  verification did not take place as it should.
+  
+  3. (related to #2) If there was no certificate of depth 0 the callback
+  would not have checked the pinned public key.
+  
+  Though all those problems could have been fixed it would have made the
+  code more complex. Instead we now verify inline after the certificate
+  verification in mbedtls_connect_step2.
+

+  Ref: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/601
+
+- tests: Add a test for pinnedpubkey fail even when insecure
+  
+  Because disabling the peer verification (--insecure) must not disable
+  the public key pinning check (--pinnedpubkey).

+- ssh: make CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE treat "" as NULL
+  
+  The CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE option has been documented to handle
+  empty strings specially since curl-7_25_0-31-g05a443a but the behavior
+  was unintentionally removed in curl-7_38_0-47-gfa7d04f.
+  
+  This commit restores the original behavior and clarifies it in the
+  documentation that NULL and "" have both the same meaning when passed
+  to CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE.

+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 35083ca60ed035a
+
+- openssl: improved error detection/reporting
+  
+  ... by extracting the LIB + REASON from the OpenSSL error code. OpenSSL
+  1.1.0+ returned a new func number of another cerfificate fail so this
+  required a fix and this is the better way to catch this error anyway.
+
+- openssl: for 1.1.0+ they now provide a SSLeay() macro of their own
+
+- CURLOPT_RESOLVE.3: minor language polish
+
+- configure: assume IPv6 works when cross-compiled
+  
+  The configure test uses AC_TRY_RUN to figure out if an ipv6 socket
+  works, and testing like that doesn't work for cross-compiles. These days
+  IPv6 support is widespread so a blind guess is probably more likely to
+  be 'yes' than 'no' now.
+  
+  Further: anyone who cross-compiles can use configure's --disable-ipv6 to
+  explicitly disable IPv6 and that also works for cross-compiles.
+  
+  Made happen after discussions in issue #594
+
+- TODO: "Try to URL encode given URL"
+  
+  Closes #514
+
+- ConnectionExists: only do pipelining/multiplexing when asked
+  
+  When an HTTP/2 upgrade request fails (no protocol switch), it would
+  previously detect that as still possible to pipeline on (which is
+  acorrect) and do that when PIPEWAIT was enabled even if pipelining was
+  not explictily enabled.
+  
+  It should only pipelined if explicitly asked to.

+  lib: Prefix URLs with lower-case protocol names/schemes
+  
+  Before this patch, if a URL does not start with the protocol
+  name/scheme, effective URLs would be prefixed with upper-case protocol
+  names/schemes. This behavior might not be expected by library users or
+  end users.
+  
+  For example, if `CURLOPT_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` is set to "https". And the
+  URL is "hostname/path". The effective URL would be
+  "HTTPS://hostname/path" instead of "https://hostname/path".
+  
+  After this patch, effective URLs would be prefixed with a lower-case
+  protocol name/scheme.

+  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
+  
+  Previously, when HTTP/2 is enabled and used, and stream has content
+  length known, Curl_read was not called when there was no bytes left to
+  read. Because of this, we could not make sure that
+  http2_handle_stream_close was called for every stream. Since we use
+  http2_handle_stream_close to emit trailer fields, they were
+  effectively ignored. This commit changes the code so that Curl_read is
+  called even if no bytes left to read, to ensure that
+  http2_handle_stream_close is called for every stream.

+  http2: Support trailer fields
+  
+  This commit adds trailer support in HTTP/2.  In HTTP/1.1, chunked
+  encoding must be used to send trialer fields.  HTTP/2 deprecated any
+  trandfer-encoding, including chunked.  But trailer fields are now
+  always available.
+  
+  Since trailer fields are relatively rare these days (gRPC uses them
+  extensively though), allocating buffer for trailer fields is done when
+  we detect that HEADERS frame containing trailer fields is started.  We
+  use Curl_add_buffer_* functions to buffer all trailers, just like we
+  do for regular header fields.  And then deliver them when stream is
+  closed.  We have to be careful here so that all data are delivered to
+  upper layer before sending trailers to the application.
+  
+  We can deliver trailer field one by one using NGHTTP2_ERR_PAUSE
+  mechanism, but current method is far more simple.
+  
+  Another possibility is use chunked encoding internally for HTTP/2
+  traffic.  I have not tested it, but it could add another overhead.

-  The code used some happy eyeballs logic even _after_ CONNECT has been

-  over by then.
-  
-  This is solved by splitting the multi state into two separate states

-- openssl: remove all uses of USE_SSLEAY
-  
-  SSLeay was the name of the library that was subsequently turned into
-  OpenSSL many moons ago (1999). curl does not work with the old SSLeay
-  library since years. This is now reflected by only using USE_OPENSSL in
-  code that depends on OpenSSL.

-  http2: Return error if stream was closed with other than NO_ERROR
-  
-  Previously, we just ignored error code passed to
-  on_stream_close_callback and just return 0 (success) after stream
-  closure even if stream was reset with error.  This patch records error
-  code in on_stream_close_callback, and return -1 and use CURLE_HTTP2
-  error code on abnormal stream closure.
-
-- tool: Updated the warnf() function to use the GlobalConfig structure
-  
-  As the 'error' and 'mute' options are now part of the GlobalConfig,
-  rather than per Operation, updated the warnf() function to use this
-  structure rather than the OperationConfig.
-
-- build: Removed DataExecutionPrevention directive from VC9+ project files
-  
-  Removed the DataExecutionPrevention directive from the project files for
-  Visual Studio 2008 and above. The XML value in the VC9 project files was
-  set to "0" (Default) whilst the VC10+ project files contained an empty
-  XML element.
-
-- build: Use default RandomizedBaseAddress directive in VC9+ project files
-  
-  Visual Studio 2008 introduced support for the address space layout
-  randomization (ASLR) feature of Windows Vista. However, upgrading the
-  VC8 project files to VC9 and above disabled this feature.
-  
-  Removed the RandomizedBaseAddress directive to enabled the default
-  setting (/DYNAMICBASE). Note: This doesn't appear to have any negative
-  impact when compiled and ran on Windows XP.
-
-- build: Added support to Generate.bat for files in the upcoming vauth folder

-- curl-config.in: eliminate double quotes around CURL_CA_BUNDLE
-  
-  Otherwise it expands to:
-  
-      echo ""/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt""
-  
-  Detected by ShellCheck:
-  
-      curl-config:74:16: warning: The double quotes around this do
-      nothing.  Remove or escape them. [SC2140]
-
-- nss: do not skip Curl_nss_seed() if data is NULL
-  
-  In that case, we only skip writing the error message for failed NSS
-  initialization (while still returning the correct error code).
-
-- nss: improve error handling in Curl_nss_random()
-  
-  The vtls layer now checks the return value, so it is no longer necessary
-  to abort if a random number cannot be provided by NSS.  This also fixes
-  the following Coverity report:
-  
-  Error: FORWARD_NULL (CWE-476):
-  lib/vtls/nss.c:1918: var_compare_op: Comparing "data" to null implies that "data" might be null.
-  lib/vtls/nss.c:1923: var_deref_model: Passing null pointer "data" to "Curl_failf", which dereferences it.
-  lib/sendf.c:154:3: deref_parm: Directly dereferencing parameter "data".

-- Revert "telnet.c: fix handling of 0 being returned from custom read function"
-  
-  This reverts commit 03fa576833643c67579ae216c4e7350fa9b5f2fe.
-
-- telnet.c: fix invalid use of custom read function if not being set
-  
-  obj_count can be 1 if the custom read function is set or the stdin
-  handle is a reference to a pipe. Since the pipe should be handled
-  using the PeekNamedPipe-check below, the custom read function should
-  only be used if it is actually enabled.
-
-- telnet.c: fix handling of 0 being returned from custom read function
-  
-  According to [1]: "Returning 0 will signal end-of-file to the library
-  and cause it to stop the current transfer."
-  This change makes the Windows telnet code handle this case accordingly.

-  configure: allow both --with-ca-bundle and --with-ca-path
-  
-  SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations by default (and if given non-Null
-  parameters) searches the CAfile first and falls back to CApath.  This
-  allows for CAfile to be a basis (e.g. installed by the package manager)
-  and CApath to be a user configured directory.
-  
-  This wasn't reflected by the previous configure constraint which this
-  patch fixes.

-  it's still a bug I guess.

-  avoid extra conditions.
-  
-  Use check_include_file instead of check_include_file_concat to look
-  for OpenSSL headers.  They do not need to participate in a sequence
-  of dependent system headers.  Also they may cause winsock.h to be
-  included before ws2tcpip.h, causing the latter to not be detected
-  in the sequence.

 object as the program starts up and the destructor as it terminates.  As the
 author of this libcurl-using module, you can make the constructor call
 \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP and the destructor call \fIcurl_global_cleanup(3)\fP
 and satisfy libcurl's requirements without your user having to think about it.
+(Caveat: If you are initializing libcurl from a Windows DLL you should not
+initialize it from DllMain or a static initializer because Windows holds the
+loader lock during that time and it could cause a deadlock.)
 
 \fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP has an argument that tells what particular parts of
 the global constant environment to set up.  In order to successfully use any
 value except \fICURL_GLOBAL_ALL\fP (which says to set up the whole thing), you
 must have specific knowledge of internal workings of libcurl and all other
 parts of the program of which it is part.

 <p class="level0">These global constant functions are <span Class="emphasis">not thread safe</span>, so you must not call them when any other thread in the program is running.  It isn't good enough that no other thread is using libcurl at the time, because these functions internally call similar functions of other libraries, and those functions are similarly thread-unsafe.  You can't generally know what these libraries are, or whether other threads are using them. 
 <p class="level0">The global constant situation merits special consideration when the code you are writing to use libcurl is not the main program, but rather a modular piece of a program, e.g. another library.  As a module, your code doesn't know about other parts of the program -- it doesn't know whether they use libcurl or not.  And its code doesn't necessarily run at the start and end of the whole program. 
 <p class="level0">A module like this must have global constant functions of its own, just like <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_init.html">curl_global_init</a> and <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_cleanup.html">curl_global_cleanup</a>.  The module thus has control at the beginning and end of the program and has a place to call the libcurl functions.  Note that if multiple modules in the program use libcurl, they all will separately call the libcurl functions, and that's OK because only the first <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_init.html">curl_global_init</a> and the last <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_cleanup.html">curl_global_cleanup</a> in a program change anything.  (libcurl uses a reference count in static memory). 
-<p class="level0">In a C++ module, it is common to deal with the global constant situation by defining a special class that represents the global constant environment of the module.  A program always has exactly one object of the class, in static storage.  That way, the program automatically calls the constructor of the object as the program starts up and the destructor as it terminates.  As the author of this libcurl-using module, you can make the constructor call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_init.html">curl_global_init</a> and the destructor call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_cleanup.html">curl_global_cleanup</a> and satisfy libcurl's requirements without your user having to think about it.

(Caveat: If you are initializing libcurl from a Windows DLL you should not initialize it from DllMain or a static initializer because Windows holds the loader lock during that time and it could cause a deadlock.) 
 <p class="level0"><a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_init.html">curl_global_init</a> has an argument that tells what particular parts of the global constant environment to set up.  In order to successfully use any value except <span Class="emphasis">CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</span> (which says to set up the whole thing), you must have specific knowledge of internal workings of libcurl and all other parts of the program of which it is part. 
 <p class="level0">A special part of the global constant environment is the identity of the memory allocator.  <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_init.html">curl_global_init</a> selects the system default memory allocator, but you can use <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_init_mem.html">curl_global_init_mem</a> to supply one of your own.  However, there is no way to use <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_init_mem.html">curl_global_init_mem</a> in a modular program -- all modules in the program that might use libcurl would have to agree on one allocator. 
 <p class="level0">There is a failsafe in libcurl that makes it usable in simple situations without you having to worry about the global constant environment at all: <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_init.html">curl_easy_init</a> sets up the environment itself if it hasn't been done yet.  The resources it acquires to do so get released by the operating system automatically when the program exits. 
 <p class="level0">This failsafe feature exists mainly for backward compatibility because there was a time when the global functions didn't exist.  Because it is sufficient only in the simplest of programs, it is not recommended for any program to rely on it. <p class="roffit">

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a char * pointing to a \fIfilename\fP for your public key. If not used,
 libcurl defaults to \fB$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub\fP if the HOME environment
 variable is set, and just "id_dsa.pub" in the current directory if HOME is not
 set.
 
-If an empty string is passed, libcurl will pass no public key to libssh2 which
-then tries to compute it from the private key, this is known to work when
-libssh2 1.4.0+ is linked against OpenSSL.
+If NULL (or an empty string) is passed, libcurl will pass no public key to

 - provide option for HTTP/2 "prior knowledge" over clear text
 
    As it would avoid the roundtrip-heavy Upgrade: procedures when you _know_
    it speaks HTTP/2.
 
-- provide option to allow curl to default to HTTP/2 only when using HTTPS
-
-   We could switch on HTTP/2 by-default for HTTPS quite easily and it
-   shouldn't hurt anyone, while HTTP/2 for HTTP by default could introduce
-   lots of Upgrade: roundtrips that users won't like. So a separated option
