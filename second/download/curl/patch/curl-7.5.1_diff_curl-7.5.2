+Version 7.5.2
+
+Daniel (4 January 2001)
+- As Kevin P Roth suggested, I've added text to the man page for every command
+  line option and what happens when you specify that option more than
+  once. That hasn't been exactly crystal clear before.
+
+- Made the configure script possible to run from outside the source-tree. For
+  odd reasons I can't build curl properly outside though. It has to do with
+  curl's dependencies on libcurl...
+
+- Cut off all older (dated 1999 and earlier) CHANGES entries from this file.
+  The older piece is named CHANGES.0 and is added to the CVS repository in
+  case anyone would need it.
+
+- I added another file 'CVS-INFO' to the CVS. It contains information about
+  files in the CVS that aren't included in release archives and how to build
+  curl when you get the sources off CVS.
+
+- Updated CONTRIBUTE and FAQ due to the new license.
+
+Daniel (3 January 2001)
+- Renamed README.libcurl to LIBCURL
+
+- Changed headers in all sources files to the new dual license concept of
+  curl: use the MIT/X derivate license *or* MPL. The LEGAL file was updated
+  accordingly and the MPL 1.1 and MIT/X derivate licenses are now part of the
+  release archive.
+
+Daniel (30 December 2000)
+- Made all FTP commands get sent with the trailing CRLF in one single write()
+  as splitting them up seems to confuse at least some firewalls (FW-1 being
+  one major).
+
+Daniel (19 December 2000)
+- Added file desrciptor and FILE handle leak detection to the memdebug system
+  and thus I found and removed a file descriptor leakage in the ftp parts
+  that happened when you did PORTed downloads.
+
+- Added an include <stdio.h> in <curl/curl.h> since it uses FILE *.
+
+Daniel (12 December 2000)
+- Multiple URL downloads with -O was still bugging. Not anymore I think or
+  hope, or at least I've tried... :-O
+
+- Francois Petitjean fixed another -O problem
+
 Version 7.5.1
 
 Daniel (11 December 2000)
 - Cleaned up a few of the makefiles to use unix-style newlines only. As Kevin
   P Roth found out, at least one CVS client behaved wrongly when it found
   different newline conventions within the same file.
@@ -1366,1627 +1413,6 @@
  - Added all the curl exit codes to the man page.
  - Jim Gallagher properly tracked down a bug in autoconf
    2.13. The AC_CHECK_LIB() macro wrongfully uses the -l flag before the -L
    flag to 'ld' which causes the HP-UX 10.20 flavour to fail on all libchecks
    and therefore you can't make the configure script find the openssl libs!
 
-Daniel (28 December 1999):
- - Tim Verhoeven correctly identified that curl
-   doesn't support URL formatted file names when getting ftp. Now, there's a
-   problem with getting very weird file names off FTP servers. RFC 959 defines
-   that the file name syntax to use should be the same as in the native OS of
-   the server. Since we don't know the peer server system we currently just
-   translate the URL syntax into plain letters. It is still better and with
-   the solaris 2.6-supplied ftp server it works with spaces in the file names.
-
-Daniel (27 December 1999):
- - When curl parsed cookies straight off a remote site, it corrupted the input
-   data, which, if the downloaded headers were stored made very odd characters
-   in the saved data. Correctly identified and reported by Paul Harrington.
-
-Daniel (13 December 1999):
- - General cleanups in the library interface. There had been some bad kludges
-   added during times of stress and I did my best to clean them off. It was
-   both regarding the lib API as well as include file confusions.
-
-Daniel (3 December 1999):
- - A small --stderr bug was reported by Eetu Ojanen...
-
- - who also brought the suggestion of extending the -X flag to ftp list as
-   well. So, now it is and the long option is now --request instead. It is
-   only for ftp list for now (and the former http stuff too of course).
-
-Lars J. Aas (24 November 1999):
- - Patched curl to compile and build under BeOS. Doesn't work yet though!
-
- - Corrected the Makefile.am files to allow putting object files in
-   different directories than the sources.
-
-Version 6.3.1
-
-Daniel (23 November 1999):
- - I've had this major disk crash. My good old trust-worthy source disk died
-   along with the machine that hosted it. Thank goodness most of all the
-   things I've done are either backed up elsewhere or stored in this CVS
-   server!
-
- - Michael S. Steuer pointed out a bug in the -F handling
-   that made curl hang if you posted an empty variable such as '-F name='. It
-   was one of those old bugs that never have worked properly...
-
- - Jason Baietto pointed out a general flaw in the HTTP
-   download. Curl didn't complain if it was prematurely aborted before the
-   entire download was completed. It does now.
-
-Daniel (19 November 1999):
- - Chris Maltby very accurately criticized the lack of
-   return code checks on the fwrite() calls. I did a thorough check for all
-   occurrences and corrected this.
-
-Daniel (17 November 1999):
- - Paul Harrington pointed out that the -m/--max-time option
-   doesn't work for the slow system calls like gethostbyname()... I don't have
-   any good fix yet, just a slightly less bad one that makes curl exit hard
-   when the timeout is reached.
-
- - Bjorn Reese helped me point out a possible problem that might be the reason
-   why Thomas Hurst experience problems in his Amiga version.
-
- Daniel (12 November 1999):
- - I found a crash in the new cookie file parser. It crashed when you gave
-   a plain http header file as input...
-
-Version 6.3
-
- Daniel (10 November 1999):
- - I kind of found out that the HTTP time-conditional GETs (-z) aren't always
-   respected by the web server and the document is therefore sent in whole
-   again, even though it doesn't match the requested condition. After reading
-   section 13.3.4 of RFC 2616, I think I'm doing the right thing now when I do
-   my own check as well. If curl thinks the condition isn't met, the transfer
-   is aborted prematurely (after all the headers have been received).
-
- - After comments from Robert Linden I also rewrote some parts of the man page
-   to better describe how the -F works.
-
- - Michael Anti put up a new curl download mirror in
-   China:  http://www.pshowing.com/curl/
-
- - I added the list of download mirrors to the README file
-
- - I did add more explanations to the man page
-
- Daniel (8 November 1999):
- - I made the -b/--cookie option capable of reading netscape formatted cookie
-   files as well as normal http-header files. It should be able to
-   transparently figure out what kind of file it got as input.
-
- Daniel (29 October 1999):
- - Another one of Sebastiaan van Erk's ideas (that has been requested before
-   but I seem to have forgotten who it was), is to add support for ranges in
-   FTP downloads. As usual, one request is just a request, when they're two
-   it is a demand. I've added simple support for X-Y style fetches. X has to
-   be the lower number, though you may omit one of the numbers. Use the -r/
-   --range switch (previously HTTP-only).
-
- - Sebastiaan van Erk suggested that curl should be
-   able to show the file size of a specified file. I think this is a splendid
-   idea and the -I flag is now working for FTP. It displays the file size in
-   this manner:
-        Content-Length: XXXX
-   As it resembles normal headers, and leaves us the opportunity to add more
-   info in that display if we can come up with more in the future! It also
-   makes sense since if you access ftp through a HTTP proxy, you'd get the
-   file size the same way.
-
-   I changed the order of the QUOTE command executions. They're now executed
-   just after the login and before any other command. I made this to enable
-   quote commands to run before the -I stuff is done too.
-
- - I found out that -D/--dump-header and -V/--version weren't documented in
-   the man page.
-
- - Many HTTP/1.1 servers do not support ranges. Don't ask me why. I did add
-   some text about this in the man page for the range option. The thread in
-   the mailing list that started this was initiated by Michael Anti.
-
- - I get reports about nroff crashes on solaris 2.6+ when displaying the curl
-   man page. Switch to gnroff instead, it is reported to work(!). Adam Barclay
-   reported and brought the suggestion.
-
- - In a dialogue with Johannes G. Kristinsson we came
-   up with the idea to let -H/--header specified headers replace the
-   internally generated headers, if you happened to select to add a header
-   that curl normally uses by itself. The advantage with this is not entirely
-   obvious, but in Johannes' case it means that he can use another Host: than
-   the one curl would set.
-
- Daniel (27 October 1999):
- - Jongki Suwandi brought a nice patch for (yet another) crash when following
-   a location:. This time you had to follow a https:// server's redirect to
-   get the core.
-
-Version 6.2
-
- Daniel (21 October 1999):
- - I think I managed to remove the suspicious (nil) that has been seen just
-   before the "Host:" in HTTP requests when -v was used.
- - I found out that if you followed a location: when using a proxy, without
-   having specified http:// in the URL, the protocol part was added once again
-   when moving to the next URL! (The protocol part has to be added to the
-   URL when going through a proxy since it has no protocol-guessing system
-   such as curl has.)
- - Benjamin Ritcey reported a core dump under solaris 2.6
-   with OpenSSL 0.9.4. It turned out this was due to a bad free() in main.c
-   that occurred after the download was done and completed.
- - Benjamin found ftp downloads to show the first line of the download meter
-   to get written twice, and I removed that problem. It was introduced with
-   the multiple URL support.
- - Dan Zitter correctly pointed out that curl 6.1 and earlier versions didn't
-   honor RFC 2616 chapter 4 section 2, "Message Headers": "...Field names are
-   case-insensitive..."  HTTP header parsing assumed a certain casing. Dan
-   also provided me with a patch that corrected this, which I took the liberty
-   of editing slightly.
- - Dan Zitter also provided a nice patch for config.guess to better recognize
-   the Mac OS X
- - Dan also corrected a minor problem in the lib/Makefile that caused linking
-   to fail on OS X.
-
- Daniel (19 October 1999):
- - Len Marinaccio came up with some problems with curl.  Since Windows has a
-   crippled shell, it can't redirect stderr and that causes trouble. I added
-   --stderr today which allows the user to redirect the stderr stream to a
-   file or stdout.
-
- Daniel (18 October 1999):
- - The configure script now understands the '--without-ssl' flag, which now
-   totally disable SSL/https support. Previously it wasn't possible to force
-   the configure script to leave SSL alone. The previous functionality has
-   been retained. Troy Engel helped test this new one.
-
-Version 6.1
-
- Daniel (17 October 1999):
- - I ifdef'ed or commented all the zlib stuff in the sources and configure
-   script. It turned out we needed to mock more with zlib than I initially
-   thought, to make it capable of downloading compressed HTTP documents and
-   uncompress them on the fly. I didn't mean the zlib parts of curl to become
-   more than minor so this means I halt the zlib expedition for now and wait
-   until someone either writes the code or zlib gets updated and better
-   adjusted for this kind of usage.  I won't get into details here, but a
-   short a summary is suitable:
-   - zlib can't automatically detect whether to use zlib or gzip
-     decompression methods.
-   - zlib is very neat for reading gzipped files from a file descriptor,
-     although not as nice for reading buffer-based data such as we would
-     want it.
-   - there are still some problems with the win32 version when reading from
-     a file descriptor if that is a socket
-
- Daniel (14 October 1999):
- - Moved the (external) include files for libcurl into a subdirectory named
-   curl and adjusted all #include lines to use <curl/XXXX> to maintain a
-   better name space and control of the headers. This has been requested.
-
- Daniel (12 October 1999):
- - I modified the 'maketgz' script to perform a 'make' too before a release
-   archive is put together in an attempt to make the time stamps better and
-   hopefully avoid the double configure-running that use to occur.
-
- Daniel (11 October 1999):
- - Applied Jörn's patches that fixes zlib for mingw32 compiles as well as
-   some other missing zlib #ifdef and more text on the multiple URL docs in
-   the man page.
-
-Version 6.1beta
-
- Daniel (6 October 1999):
- - Douglas E. Wegscheid sent me a patch that made the exact same thing as I
-   just made: the -d switch is now capable of reading post data from a named
-   file or stdin.  Use it similarly to the -F. To read the post data from a
-   given file:
-
-        curl -d @path/to/filename www.postsite.com
-
-   or let curl read it out from stdin:
-
-        curl -d @- www.postit.com
-
- Jörn Hartroth (3 October 1999):
- - Brought some more patches for multiple URL functionality. The MIME
-   separation ideas are almost scrapped now, and a custom separator is being
-   used instead. This is still compile-time "flagged".
-
- Daniel
- - Updated curl.1 with multiple URL info.
-
- Daniel (30 September 1999):
- - Felix von Leitner brought openssl-check fixes for configure.in to work
-   out-of-the-box when the openssl files are installed in the system default
-   dirs.
-
- Daniel (28 September 1999)
- - Added libz functionality. This should enable decompressing gzip, compress
-   or deflate encoding HTTP documents. It also makes curl send an accept that
-   it accepts that kind of encoding. Compressed contents usually shortens
-   download time. I *need* someone to tell me a site that uses compressed HTTP
-   documents so that I can test this out properly.
-
- - As a result of the adding of zlib awareness, I changed the version string
-   a little. I plan to add openldap version reporting in there too.
-
- Daniel (17 September 1999)
- - Made the -F option allow stdin when specifying files. By using '-' instead
-   of file name, the data will be read from stdin.
-
-Version 6.0
-
- Daniel (13 September 1999)
- - Added -X/--http-request <request> to enable any HTTP command to be sent.
-   Do not that your server has to support the exact string you enter. This
-   should possibly a string like DELETE or TRACE.
-
- - Applied Douglas' mingw32-fixes for the makefiles.
-
- Daniel (10 September 1999)
- - Douglas E. Wegscheid pointed out a problem. Curl didn't check the FTP
-   servers return code properly after the --quote commands were issued. It
-   took anything non 200 as an error, when all 2XX codes should be accepted as
-   OK.
-
- - Sending cookies to the same site in multiple lines like curl used to do
-   turned out to be bad and breaking the cookie specs. Curl now sends all
-   cookies on a single Cookie: line. Curl is not yet RFC 2109 compliant, but I
-   doubt that many servers do use that syntax (yet).
-
- Daniel (8 September 1999)
- - Jörn helped me make sure it still compiles nicely with mingw32 under win32.
-
- Daniel (7 September 1999)
- - FTP upload through proxy is now turned into a HTTP PUT. Requested by
-   Stefan Kanthak.
-
- - Added the ldap files to the .m32 makefile.
-
- Daniel (3 September 1999)
- - Made cookie matching work while using HTTP proxy.
-
- Bjorn Reese (31 August 1999)
- - Passed his ldap:// patch. Note that this requires the openldap shared
-   library to be installed and that LD_LIBRARY_PATH points to the
-   directory where the lib will be found when curl is run with a
-   ldap:// URL.
-
- Jörn Hartroth (31 August 1999)
- - Made the Mingw32 makefiles into single files.
- - Made file:// work for Win32. The same code is now used for unix as well for
-   performance reasons.
-
- Douglas E. Wegscheid (30 August 1999)
- - Patched the Mingw32 makefiles for SSL builds.
-
- Matthew Clarke (30 August 1999)
- - Made a cool patch for configure.in to allow --with-ssl to specify the
-   root dir of the openssl installation, as in
-
-        ./configure --with-ssl=/usr/ssl_here
-
- - Corrected the 'reconf' script to work better with some shells.
-
- Jörn Hartroth (26 August 1999)
- - Fixed the Mingw32 makefiles in lib/ and corrected the file.c for win32
-   compiles.
-
-Version 5.11
-
- Daniel (25 August 1999)
- - John Weismiller pointed out a bug in the header-line
-   realloc() system in download.c.
-
- - I added lib/file.[ch] to offer a first, simple, file:// support. It
-   probably won't do much good on win32 system at this point, but I see it
-   as a start.
-
- - Made the release archives get a Makefile in the root dir, which can be
-   used to start the compiling/building process easier. I haven't really
-   changed any INSTALL text yet, I wanted to get some feed-back on this
-   first.
-
- Daniel (17 August 1999)
- - Another Location: bug. Curl didn't do proper relative locations if the
-   original URL had cgi-parameters that contained a slash. Nusu's page
-   again.
-
- - Corrected the NO_PROXY usage. It is a list of substrings that if one of
-   them matches the tail of the host name it should connect to, curl should
-   not use a proxy to connect there. Pointed out to me by Douglas
-   E. Wegscheid.  I also changed the README text a little regarding this.
-
- Daniel (16 August 1999)
- - Fixed a memory bug with http-servers that sent Location: to a Location:
-   page. Nusu's page showed this too.
-
- - Made cookies work a lot better. Setting the same cookie name several times
-   used to add more cookies instead of replacing the former one which it
-   should've. Nusu <nus at intergorj.ro> brought me an URL that made this
-   painfully visible...
-
- Troy (15 August 1999)
- - Brought new .spec files as well as a patch for configure.in that lets the
-   configure script find the openssl files better, even when the include
-   files are in /usr/include/openssl
-
-Version 5.10
-
- Daniel (13 August 1999)
- - SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb() has been modified in the 0.9.4 version of
-   OpenSSL. Now why couldn't they simply add a *new* function instead of
-   modifying the parameters of an already existing function? This way, we get
-   a compiler warning if compiling with 0.9.4 but not with earlier. So, I had
-   to come up with a #if construction that deals with this...
-
- - Made curl output the SSL version number get displayed properly with 0.9.4.
-
- Troy (12 August 1999)
- - Added MingW32 (GCC-2.95) support under Win32. The INSTALL file was also
-   a bit rearranged.
- 
- Daniel (12 August 1999)
- - I had to copy a good <arpa/telnet.h> include file into the curl source
-   tree to enable the silly win32 systems to compile. The distribution rights
-   allows us to do that as long as the file remains unmodified.
-
- - I corrected a few minor things that made the compiler complain when
-   -Wall -pedantic was used.
-
- - I'm moving the official curl web page to http://curl.haxx.nu. I think it
-   will make it easier to remember as it is a lot shorter and less cryptic.
-   The old one still works and shows the same info.
-
- Daniel (11 August 1999)
- - Albert Chin-A-Young mailed me another correction for NROFF in the
-   configure.in that is supposed to be better for IRIX users.
-
- Daniel (10 August 1999)
- - Albert Chin-A-Young helped me with some stupid Makefile things, as well as
-   some fiddling with the getdate.c stuff that he had problems with under
-   HP-UX v10. getdate.y will now be compiled into getdate.c if the appropriate
-   yacc or bison is found by the configure script. Since this is slightly new,
-   we need to test the output getdate.c with win32 systems to make sure it
-   still compiles there.
-
- Daniel (5 August 1999)
- - I've just setup a new mailing list with the intention to keep discussions
-   around libcurl development in it. I mainly expect it to be for thoughts and
-   brainstorming around a "next generation" library, rather than nitpicking
-   about the current implementation or details in the current libcurl.
-
-   To join our happy bunch of future-looking geeks, enter 'subscribe
-   <address>' in the body of a mail and send it to
-   libcurl-request@listserv.fts.frontec.se.  Curl bug reports, the usual curl
-   talk and everything else should still be kept in this mailing list. I've
-   started to archive this mailing list and have put the libcurl web page at
-   www.fts.frontec.se/~dast/libcurl/.
-
- - Stefan Kanthak contacted me regarding a few problems in the configure
-   script which he discovered when trying to make curl compile and build under
-   Siemens SINIX-Z V5.42B2004!
-
- - Marcus Klein very accurately informed me that src/version.h was not present
-   in the CVS repository. Oh, how silly...
-
- - Linus Nielsen rewrote the telnet:// part and now curl offers limited telnet
-   support. If you run curl like 'curl telnet://host' you'll get all output on
-   the screen and curl will read input from stdin. You'll be able to login and
-   run commands etc, but since the output is buffered, expect to get a little
-   weird output.
-
-   This is still in its infancy and it might get changed. We need your
-   feed-back and input in how this is best done.
-
-   WIN32 NOTE: I bet we'll get problems when trying to compile the current
-   lib/telnet.c on win32, but I think we can sort them out in time.
-
- - David Sanderson reported that FORCE_ALLOCA_H or HAVE_ALLOCA_H must be
-   defined for getdate.c to compile properly on HP-UX 11.0. I updated the
-   configure script to check for alloca.h which should make it.
-
- Daniel (4 August 1999)
- - I finally got to understand Marcus Klein's ftp download resume problem,
-   which turns out to be due to different outputs from different ftp
-   servers. It makes ftp download resuming a little trickier, but I've made
-   some modifications I really believe will work for most ftp servers and I do
-   hope you report if you have problems with this!
-
- - Added text about file transfer resuming to README.curl.
-
- Daniel (2 August 1999)
- - Applied a progress-bar patch from Lars J. Aas. It offers
-   a new styled progress bar enabled with -#/--progress-bar. 
-
- T. Yamada <tai at imasy.or.jp> (30 July 1999)
- - It breaks with segfault when 1) curl is using .netrc to obtain
-   username/password (option '-n'), and 2) is automatically redirected to
-   another location (option '-L').
-
-   There is a small bug in lib/url.c (block starting from line 641), which
-   tries to take out username/password from user- supplied command-line
-   argument ('-u' option). This block is never executed on first attempt since
-   CONF_USERPWD bit isn't set at first, but curl later turns it on when it
-   checks for CONF_NETRC bit. So when curl tries to redo everything due to
-   redirection, it segfaults trying to access *data->userpwd.
-
-Version 5.9.1
-
- Daniel (30 July 1999)
- - Steve Walch pointed out that there is a memory leak in the formdata
-   functions. I added a FormFree() function that is now used and supposed to
-   correct this flaw.
-
- - Mark Wotton reported:
-   'curl -L https://www.cwa.com.au/' core dumps.  I managed to cure this by
-   correcting the cleanup procedure. The bug seems to be gone with my OpenSSL
-   0.9.2b, although still occurs when I run the ~100 years old SSLeay 0.8.0. I
-   don't know whether it is curl or SSLeay that is to blame for that.
-
- - Marcus Klein:
-   Reported an FTP upload resume bug that I really can't repeat nor understand.
-   I leave it here so that it won't be forgotten.
-
- Daniel (29 July 1999)
- - Costya Shulyupin suggested support for longer URLs when following Location:
-   and I could only agree and fix it!
-
- - Leigh Purdie found a problem in the upload/POST department. It turned out
-   that http.c accidentaly cleared the pointer instead of the byte counter
-   when supposed to.
-
- - Costya Shulyupin pointed out a problem with port numbers and Location:. If
-   you had a server at a non-standard port that redirected to an URL using a
-   standard port number, curl still used that first port number.
-
- - Ralph Beckmann pointed out a problem when using both CONF_FOLLOWLOCATION
-   and CONF_FAILONERROR simultaneously. Since the CONF_FAILONERROR exits on
-   the 302-code that the follow location header outputs it will never show any
-   html on location: pages. I have now made it look for >=400 codes if
-   CONF_FOLLOWLOCATION is set.
-
- - 'struct slist' is now renamed to 'struct curl_slist' (as suggested by Ralph
-   Beckmann).
-
- - Joshua Swink and Rick Welykochy were the first to point out to me that the
-   latest OpenSSL package now have moved the standard include path. It is now
-   in /usr/local/ssl/include/openssl and I have now modified the --enable-ssl
-   option for the configure script to use that as the primary path, and I
-   leave the former path too to work with older packages of OpenSSL too.
-
- Daniel (9 June 1999)
- - I finally understood the IRIX problem and now it seem to compile on it!
-   I am gonna remove those #define strcasecmp() things once and for all now.
-
- Daniel (4 June 1999)
- - I adjusted the FTP reply 227 parser to make the PASV command work better
-   with more ftp servers. Appearantly the Roxen Challanger server replied
-   something curl 5.9 could deal with! :-( Reported by Ashley Reid-Montanaro
-   and Mark Butler brought a solution for it.
-
- Daniel (26 May 1999)
- - Rearranged. README is new, the old one is now README.curl and I added a
-   README.libcurl with text I got from Ralph Beckmann.
-
- - I also updated the INSTALL text.
-
- Daniel (25 May 1999)
- - David Jonathan Lowsky correctly pointed out that curl didn't properly deal
-   with form posting where the variable shouldn't have any content, as in curl
-   -F "form=" www.site.com. It was now fixed.
-
-Version 5.9
-
- Daniel (22 May 1999)
- - I've got a bug report from Aaron Scarisbrick in which he states he has some
-   problems with -L under FreeBSD 3.0. I have previously got another bug
-   report from Stefan Grether which points at an error with similar sympthoms
-   when using win32. I made the allocation of the new url string a bit faster
-   and different, don't know if it actually improves anything though...
-
- Daniel (20 May 1999)
- - Made the cookie parser deal with CRLF newlines too.
-
- Daniel (19 May 1999)
- - Download() didn't properly deal with failing return codes from the sread()
-   function. Adam Coyne found the problem in the win32 version, and Troy Engel
-   helped me out isolating it.
-
- Daniel (16 May 1999)
- - Richard Adams pointed out a bug I introduced in 5.8. --dump-header doesn't
-   work anymore! :-/ I fixed it now.
-
- - After a suggestion by Joshua Swink I added -S / --show-error to force curl
-   to display the error message in case of an error, even if -s/--silent was
-   used.
-
- Daniel (10 May 1999)
- - I moved the stuff concerning HTTP, DICT and TELNET it their own source
-   files now. It is a beginning on my clean-up of the sources to make them
-   layer all those protocols better to enable more to be added easier in the
-   future!
-
- - Leon Breedt sent me some files I've not put into the main curl
-   archive. They're for creating the Debian package thingie. He also sent me a
-   debian package that I've made available for download at the web page
-
- Daniel (9 May 1999)
- - Made it compile on cygwin too.
-
- Troy Engel (7 May 1999)
- - Brought a series of patches to allow curl to compile smoothly on MSVC++ 6
-   again!
-
- Daniel (6 May 1999)
- - I changed the #ifdef HAVE_STRFTIME placement for the -z code so that it
-   will be easier to discover systems that don't have that function and thus
-   can't use -z successfully. Made the strftime() get used if WIN32 is defined
-   too.
-
-Version 5.8
-
- Daniel (5 May 1999)
- - I've had it with this autoconf/automake mess. It seems to work allright
-   for most people who don't have automake installed, but for those who have
-   there are problems all over.
-
-   I've got like five different bug reports on this only the last
-   week... Claudio Neves and Federico Bianchi and root <duggerj001 at
-   hawaii.rr.com> are some of them reporting this.
-
-   Currently, I have no really good fix since I want to use automake myself to
-   generate the Makefile.in files. I've found out that the @SHELL@-problems
-   can often be fixed by manually invoking 'automake' in the archive root
-   before you run ./configure... I've hacked my maketgz script now to fiddle
-   a bit with this and my tests seem to work better than before at least!
-
- Daniel (4 May 1999)
- - mkhelp.pl has been doing badly lately. I corrected a case problem in
-   the regexes.
-
- - I've now remade the -o option to not touch the file unless it needs to.
-   I had to do this to make -z option really fine, since now you can make a
-   curl fetch and use a local copy's time when downloading to that file, as
-   in:
-
-        curl -z dump -o dump remote.site.com/file.html
-
-   This will only get the file if the remote one is newer than the local.
-   I'm aware that this alters previous behaviour a little. Some scripts out
-   there may depend on that the file is always touched...
-
- - Corrected a bug in the SSLv2/v3 selection.
-
- - Felix von Leitner requested that curl should be able to send
-   "If-Modified-Since" headers, which indeed is a fair idea.  I implemented it
-   right away! Try -z <expression> where expression is a full GNU date
-   expression or a file name to get the date from!
-
- Stephan Lagerholm (30 Apr 1999)
- - Pointed out a problem with the src/Makefile for FreeBSD. The RM variable
-   isn't set and causes the make to fail.
-
- Daniel (26 April 1999)
- - Am I silly or what? Irving Wolfe pointed out to me that the curl version
-   number was not set properly. Hasn't been since 5.6. This was due to a bug
-   in my maketgz script!
-
- David Eriksson (25 Apr 1999)
- - Found a bug in cookies.c that made it crash at times.
-
-Version 5.7.1
-
- Doug Kaufman (23 Apr 1999)
- - Brought two sunos 4 fixes. One of them being the hostip.c fix mentioned
-   below and the other one a correction in include/stdcheaders.h
-
- - Added a paragraph about compiling with the US-version of openssl to the
-   INSTALL file.
-
- Daniel
- - New mailing list address. Info updated on the web page as well as in the
-   README file
-
- Greg Onufer (20 Apr 1999)
- - hostip.c didn't compile properly on SunOS 5.5.1.
-   It needs an #include <sys/types.h>
-
-Version 5.7
-
- Daniel (Apr 20 1999)
- - Decided to upload a non-beta version right now!
-
- - Made curl support any-length HTTP headers. The destination buffer is now
-   simply enlarged every time it turns out to be too small!
-
- - Added the FAQ file to the archive. Still a bit smallish, but it is a
-   start.
-
- Eric Thelin (15 Apr 1999)
- - Made -D accept '-' instead of filename to write to stdout.
-
-Version 5.6.3beta
-
- Daniel (Apr 12 1999)
-
- - Changed two #ifdef WIN32 to better #ifdef <errorcode> when connect()ing
-   in url.c and ftp.c. Makes cygwin32 deal with them better too. We should
-   try to get some decent win32-replacement there. Anyone?
-
- - The old -3/--crlf option is now ONLY --crlf!
-
- - I changed the "SSL fix" to a more lame one, but that doesn't remove as
-   much functionality. Now I've enabled the lib to select what SSL version it
-   should try first. Appearantly some older SSL-servers don't like when you
-   talk v3 with them so you need to be able to force curl to talk v2 from the
-   start. The fix dated April 6 and posted on the mailing list forced curl to
-   use v2 at all times using a modern OpenSSL version, but we don't really
-   want such a crippled solution.
- 
- - Marc Boucher sent me a patch that corrected a math error for the
-   "Curr.Speed" progress meter.
-
- - Eric Thelin sent me a patch that enables '-K -' to read a config file from
-   stdin.
-
- - I found out we didn't close the file properly before so I added it!
-
- Daniel (Apr 9 1999)
- - Yu Xin pointed out a problem with ftp download resume.  It didn't work at
-   all! ;-O
-
- Daniel (Apr 6 1999)
- - Corrected the version string part generated for the SSL version.
-
- - I found a way to make some other SSL page work with openssl 0.9.1+ that
-   previously didn't (ssleay 0.8.0 works with it though!). Trying to get
-   some real info from the OpenSSL guys to see how I should do to behave the
-   best way. SSLeay 0.8.0 shouldn't be that much in use anyway these days!
-
-Version 5.6.2beta
-
- Daniel (Apr 4 1999)
- - Finally have curl more cookie "aware". Now read carefully. This is how
-   it works.
-   To make curl read cookies from an already existing file, in plain header-
-   format (like from the headers of a previous fetch) invoke curl with the
-   -b flag like:
-
-        curl -b file http://site/foo.html
-
-   Curl will then use all cookies it finds matching. The old style that sets
-   a single cookie with -b is still supported and is used if the string
-   following -b includes a '=' letter, as in "-b name=daniel".
-
-   To make curl read the cookies sent in combination with a location: (which
-   sites often do) point curl to read a non-existing file at first (i.e
-   to start with no existing cookies), like:
-
-        curl -b nowhere http://site/setcookieandrelocate.html
-
- - Added a paragraph in the TODO file about the SSL problems recently
-   reported. Evidently, some kind of SSL-problem curl may need to address.
-
- - Better "Location:" following.
-
- Douglas E. Wegscheid (Tue, 30 Mar 1999)
- - A subsecond display patch.
-
- Daniel (Mar 14 1999)
- - I've separated the version number of libcurl and curl now. To make
-   things a little easier, I decided to start the curl numbering from
-   5.6 and the former version number known as "curl" is now the one
-   set for libcurl.
-
- - Removed the 'enable-no-pass' from configure, I doubt anyone wanted
-   that.
-
- - Made lots of tiny adjustments to compile smoothly with cygwin under
-   win32. It's a killer for porting this to win32, bye bye VC++! ;-)
-   Compiles and builds out-of-the-box now. See the new wordings in
-   INSTALL for details.
-
- - Beginning experiments with downloading multiple document from a http
-   server while remaining connected.
-
-Version 5.6beta
-
- Daniel (Mar 13 1999)
- - Since I've changed so much, I thought I'd just go ahead and implement the
-   suggestion from Douglas E. Wegscheid. -D or --dump-header is now storing
-   HTTP headers separately in the specified file.
-
- - Added new text to INSTALL on what to do to build this on win32 now.
-
- - Aaargh. I had to take a step back and prefix the shared #include files
-   in the sources with "../include/" to please VC++...
-
- Daniel (Mar 12 1999)
- - Split the url.c source into many tiny sources for better readability
-   and smaller size.
-
- Daniel (Mar 11 1999)
- - Started to change stuff for a move to make libcurl and a more separate
-   curl application that uses the libcurl. Made the libcurl sources into
-   the new lib directory while the curl application will remain in src as
-   before. New makefiles, adjusted configure script and so.
-
-   libcurl.a built quickly and easily. I better make a better interface to
-   the lib functions though.
-
-   The new root dir include/ is supposed to contain the public information
-   about the new libcurl. It is a little ugly so far :-)
-
-
- Daniel (Mar 1 1999)
- - Todd Kaufmann sent me a good link to Netscape's cookie spec as well as the
-   info that RFC 2109 specifies how to use them.  The link is now in the
-   README and the RFC in the RESOURCES.
-
- Daniel (Feb 23 1999)
- - Finally made configure accept --with-ssl to look for SSL libs and includes
-   in the "standard" place /usr/local/ssl...
-
- Daniel (Feb 22 1999)
- - Verified that curl linked fine with OpenSSL 0.9.1c which seems to be
-   the most recent.
-
- Henri Gomez (Fri Feb  5 1999)
- - Sent in an updated curl-ssl.spec. I still miss the script that builds an
-   RPM automatically...
-
-Version 5.5.1
-
- Mark Butler (27 Jan 1999)
- - Corrected problems in Download().
-
- Danitel Stenberg (25 Jan 1999)
- - Jeremie Petit pointed out a few flaws in the source that prevented it from
-   compile warning free with the native compiler under Digital Unix v4.0d.
-
-Version 5.5
-
- Daniel Stenberg (15 Jan 1999)
- - Added Bjorns small text to the README about the DICT protocol.
-
- Daniel Stenberg (11 Jan 1999)
- - <jswink at softcom.net> reported about the win32-versioin: "Doesn't use
-   ALL_PROXY environment variable". Turned out to be because of the static-
-   buffer nature of the win32 environment variable calls!
-
- Bjorn Reese (10 Jan 1999)
- - I have attached a simple addition for the DICT protocol (RFC 2229).
-   It performs dictionary lookups. The output still needs to be better
-   formatted.
-
-   To test it try (the exact format, and more examples are described in
-   the RFC)
-
-        dict://dict.org/m:hello
-        dict://dict.org/m:hello::soundex
-
-
- Vicente Garcia (10 Jan 1999)
- - Corrected the progress meter for files larger than 20MB.
-
- Daniel Stenberg (7 Jan 1999)
- - Corrected the -t and -T help texts. They claimed to be FTP only.
-
-Version 5.4
-
- Daniel Stenberg
- (7 Jan 1999)
- - Irving Wolfe reported that curl -s didn't always supress the progress
-   reporting. It was the form post that autoamtically always switched it on
-   again. This is now corrected!
-
- (4 Jan 1999)
- - Andreas Kostyrka suggested I'd add PUT and he helped me out to test it. If
-   you use -t or -T now on a http or https server, PUT will be used for file
-   upload.
-
-   I removed the former use of -T with HTTP. I doubt anyone ever really used
-   that.
-
- (4 Jan 1999)
- - Erik Jacobsen found a width bug in the mprintf() function.  I corrected it
-   now.
-
- (4 Jan 1999)
- - As John V. Chow pointed out to me, curl accepted very limited URL sizes. It
-   should now accept path parts that are up to at least 4096 bytes.
-
- - Somehow I screwed up when applying the AIX fix from Gilbert Ramirez, so
-   I redid that now.
-
-Version 5.3a (win32 only)
-
- Troy Engel
- - Corrected a win32 bug in the environment variable part.
-
-Version 5.3
-
- Gilbert Ramirez Jr. (21 Dec 1998)
- - I have implemented the "quote" function of FTP clients. It allows you to
-   send arbitrary commands to the remote FTP server. I chose the -Q/--quote
-   command-line arguments.
-
-   You can have more than one quoted string, and curl will apply them in
-   order.  This is what I use for my MVS upload:
-
-  curl -B --crlf -Q "site lrecl=80" -Q "site blk=8000" -T file ftp://os390/test
-
-   Curl will send the two quoted "site" commands in the proper order.
-
- - Made it compile smoothly on AIX.
-
- Gilbert Ramirez Jr. (18 Dec 1998)
- - Brought an MVS patch: -3/--mvs, for ftp upload to the MVS ftp server.
-
- Troy Engel (17 Dec 1998)
- - Brought a correction that fixes the win32 curl bug.
-
- Daniel Stenberg
- - A bug, pointed out to me by Dr H. T. Leung, caused curl to crash on the -A
-   flag on certain systems. Actually, all systems should've!
-
- - Added a few defines to make directories/file names get build nicer (with _
-   instead of . and \ instead of / in win32).
-
- - steve <fisk at polar.bowdoin.edu> reported a weird bug that occured if the
-   ftp server response line had a parenthesis on the line before the (size)
-   info. I hope it works better now!
-
-Version 5.2.1
-
- Steven G. Johnson (Dec 14, 1998)
- - Brought a fix that corrected a crash in 5.2 due to bad treatment of the
-   environment variables.
-
-Version 5.2
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Dec 14, 1998)
- - Rewrote the mkhelp script and now, the mkhelp.pl script generates the
-   hugehelp.c file from the README *and* the man page file curl.1. By using
-   both files, I no longer need to have double information in both the man
-   page and the README as well. So, win32-users will only have the hugehelp.c
-   file for all info, but then, they download the plain binary most times
-   anyway.
-
- - gcc2.8.1 with the -Wall flag complaints a lot on subscript has type `char'
-   if I don't explicitly typecast the argument to isdigit() or isspace() to
-   int. So I did to compile warning free with that too.
-
- - Added checks for 'long double' and 'long long' in the configure script. I
-   need those for the mprintf.c source to compile well on non long long
-   comforming systems!
-
-Version 5.1 (not publicly released)
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Dec 10, 1998)
- - I got a request for a pre-compiled NT Alpha version. Anyone?
-
- - Added Lynx/CERN www lib proxy environment variable support. That means curl
-   now reads and understands the following environment variables:
-
-	HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, FTP_PROXY, GOPHER_PROXY
-
-   They should be set for protocol-specific proxies. General proxy should be
-   set with
-	
-	ALL_PROXY
-
-   And a comma-separated list of host names that shouldn't go through any
-   proxy is set in (only an asterisk, '*' matches all hosts).
-
-	NO_PROXY
-
-   The usage of the -x/--proxy flag overrides the environment variables.
-
- - Proxy can now be specified with a procotol:// prefix.
-
- - Wrote the curl.1 man page.
-
- - Introduced a whole new dynamic buffer system for all sprintf()s. It is
-   based on the *printf() package by yours truly and Bjorn Reese. Hopefully,
-   there aren't that many buffer overflow risks left now.
-
- - Ah, I should mention I've compiled and built curl successfully under
-   solaris 2.6 with gcc now, gcc 2.7.2 won't work but 2.8.1 did ok.
-
- Oren Tirosh (Dec 3, 1998)
- - Brought two .spec files, to use when creating (Linux) Redhat style RPM
-   packages. They're named curl.spec and curl-ssl.spec.
-
- Troy Engel
- - Supplied the src/Makefile.vc6 for easy compiling with VC++ under Win32.
-
-Version 5.0
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Dec 1, 1998)
- - Not a single bug report in ages.
- - Corrected getpass.c and main.c to compile warning and error free with the
-   Win32 VC++ crap.
-
-Version 5.0 beta 24

-
- HOW TO BUILD A RELEASE ARCHIVE:
-
- * Pre-requisite software:
-   What		     To build what             Reads data from
-   ====              =============             ===============
-   GNU automake      Makefile.in, aclocal.m4   configure.in
-     GNU make(1)      - " -
-     GNU gcc(1)       - " -
-   GNU autoconf      configure                 configure.in
-   GNU autoheader(2) config.h.in	       configure.in, acconfig.h
-
- * Make sure all files that should be part of the archive are put in FILES.
-
- * Run './maketgz' and enter version number of the new to become archive.
-
-   maketgz does:
-
-   - Enters the newly created version number in url.h.
-   - (If you don't have automake, this script will warn about that, but unless
-     you have changed the Makefile.am files, that is nothing to care about.)
-     If you have it, it'll run it.
-   - If you have autoconf, the configure.in will be edited to get the newly
-     created version number and autoconf will be run.
-   - Creates a new directory named curl-<version>. (Actually, it uses the base
-     name of the current directory up to the first '-'.)
-   - Copies all files mentioned in FILES to the new directory. Saving
-     permissions and directory structure.
-   - Uses tar to create an archive of it all, named curl-<version>.tar.gz
-   - gzips the archive
-   - Removes the new directory and all its contents.
-
- * When done, you have an archive stored in your directory named
-   curl-<version>.tar.gz.
-
-   Done!
-
-   (1) They're required to make automake run properly.
-   (2) It is distributed as a part of the GNU autoconf archive.
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Nov 18, 1998)
- - I changed the TAG-system. If you ever used urlget() from this package in
-   another product, you need to recompile with the new headers. I did this
-   new stuff to better deal with different compilers and system with different
-   variable sizes. I think it makes it a little more portable. This proves
-   to compile warning free with the problematic IRIX compiler!
- - Win32 compiled with a silly error. Corrected now.
- - Brian Chaplin reported yet another problem in
-   multiline FTP responses. I've tried to correct it. I mailed him a new
-   version and I hope he gets back soon with positive feedback!
- - Improved the 'maketgz' to create a temporary directory tree which it makes
-   an archive from instead of the previous renaming of the current one.
- - Mailing list opened (see README).
- - Made -v more verbose on the PASV section of ftp transfers. Now it tells
-   host name and IP of the new host (and port number). I also added a section
-   about PORT vs PASV in the README.
-
-Version 5.0 beta 21
-
- Angus Mackay (Nov 15, 1998)
- - Introduced automake stuff.
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Nov 13, 1998)
- - Just made a successful GET of a document from an SSL-server using my own
-   private certificate for authentication! The certificate has to be in PEM
-   format. You do that the easiest way (although not *that* easy) by
-   downloading the SSLyeay PKCS#12-patch by Dr Stephen N. Henson from his site
-   at: http://www.drh-consultancy.demon.co.uk/. Using his tool, you can
-   convert any modern Netscape or (even) MSIE certificate to PEM-format.  Use
-   it with 'curl -E <certificate:password> https://site.com'.  If this isn't a
-   cool feature, then I don't know what cool features look like! ;-)
- - Working slowly on telnet connections. #define TRY_TELNET to try it out.
-   (curl -u user:passwd "telnet://host.com/cat .login" is one example) I do
-   have problem to define how it should work. The prime purpose for this must
-   be to get (8bit clean) files via telnet, and it really isn't that easy to
-   get files this way. Still having problems with \n being converted to \r\n.
-
- Angus Mackay (Nov 12, 1998)
- - Corrected another bug in the long parameter name parser.
- - Modified getpass.c (NOTE: see the special licensing in the top of that
-   source file).
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Nov 12, 1998)
- - We may have removed the silly warnings from url.c when compiled under IRIX.
-   Thanks again to Bjorn Reese and Martin Staael.
- - Wrote formfind.pl which is a new perl script intended to help you find out
-   how a FORM submission should be done. This needs a little more work to get
-   really good.
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Nov 11, 1998)
- - Made the HTTP header-checker accept white spaces before the HTTP/1.? line.
-   Appearantly some proxies/sites add such at times (my test proxy did when I
-   downloaded a gopher page with it)!
- - Moved the former -h to -M and made -h show the short help text instead. I
-   had to enable a forced help text option. Now an even shorter help text will
-   be presented when an unknown option and similar, is used.
- - stdcheaders.h didn't work with IRIX 6.4 native cc compiler. I hope my
-   changes don't make other versions go nuts instead.
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Nov 10, 1998)
- - Added a weird check in the configure script to check for the silly AIX
-   warnings about my #define strcasecmp() stuff. I do that define to prevent
-   me and other contributors to accidentaly use that function name instead
-   of strequal()...
- - I bugfixed Angus's getpass.c very little.
- - Fixed the verbose flag names to getopt-style, i.e 'curl --loc' will be
-   sufficient instead of --location as "loc" is a unique prefix. Also, anything
-   after a '--' is treated as an URL. So if you do have a host with a weeeird
-   name you can do 'curl -- -host.com'.
- - Another getopt-adjust; curl now accepts flags after the URL on the command
-   line. 'curl www.foo.com -O' is perfectly valid.
- - Corrected the .curlrc parser so that strtok() is no longer used and I
-   believe it works better. Even URLs can be specified in it now.

- Angus Mackay (Nov 9, 1998)
- - Replaced getpass.c with a newly written one, not under GPL license
- - Changed OS to a #define in config.h instead of compiler flag
- - Makefile now uses -DHAVE_CONFIG_H
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Nov 9, 1998)
- - Ok, I expanded the tgz-target to update the version string on each occation
-   I build a release archive!
- - I reacted on Angus Mackay's initiative and remade the parameter parser to
-   be more getopt compliant. Curl now supports "merged" flags as in 
-	curl -lsv ftp.site.com
-   Do note that I had to move three short-names of the options. Parameters
-   that needs an additional string such as -x must be stand-alone or the
-   last in a merged sequence:
-	curl -lsx my-proxy ftp.site.com
-   is ok, but using the flags in a different order like '-lxs' would cause
-   unexpected results (as the 's' option would be skipped).
- - I've changed the headers in all files that are subject to the MozPL
-   license, as they are supposed to look like when conforming.
- - Made the configure script make the config.h. The former config.h is now
-   setup.h.
- - The RESOURCES and TODO files have been added to the archive.
-
- Angus Mackay (Nov 5, 1998)
- - Fixed getpass.c and various configure stuff
-
- Daniel Stenberg (Nov 3, 1998)
- - Use -H/--header for custom HTTP-headers. Lets you pass on your own
-   specified headers to the remote server. I wouldn't recommend trying to use
-   a header with a defined usage according to standards. Use this flag once
-   for every custom header you want to add.
- - Use -B/--ftp-ascii to force ftp to use ASCII mode when transfering files.
- - Corrected the 'getlinks.pl' script, I accidentally left my silly proxy
-   usage in there! Since the introduction of the .curlrc file, it is easier to
-   write scripts that use curl since proxies and stuff should be in the
-   .curlrc file anyway.
- - Introducing the new -F flag for HTTP POST. It supports multipart/form-data
-   which means it is gonna be possible to upload files etc through HTTP POST.
-   Shiraz Kanga asked for the feature and my brother,
-   Björn Stenberg helped me design the user
-   interface for this beast.  This feature requires quite some docs,
-   since it has turned out not only quite capable, but also complicated! :-)
- - A note here, since I've received mail about it. SSLeay versions prior to
-   0.8 will *not* work with curl!
- - Wil Langford reported a bug that occurred since curl
-   did not properly use CRLF when issuing ftp commands. I fixed it.
- - Rearranged the order config files are read. .curlrc is now *always* read
-   first and before the command line flags. -K config files then act as
-   additional config items.
- - Use -q AS THE FIRST OPTION specified to prevent .curlrc from being read.
- - You can now disable a proxy by using -x "". Useful if the .curlrc file
-   specifies a proxy and you wanna fetch something without going through
-   that.
- - I'm thinking of dropping the -p support. Its really not useful since ports
-   could (and should?) be specified as :<port> appended on the host name
-   instead, both in URLs and to proxy host names.
- - Martin Staael reports curl -L bugs under Windows NT
-   (test with URL http://come.to/scsde). This bug is not present in this
-   version anymore.
- - Added support for the weird FTP URL type= thing. You can download a file
-   using ASCII transfer by appending ";type=A" to the right of it. Other
-   available types are type=D for dir-list (NLST) and type=I for binary
-   transfer. I can't say I've ever seen anyone use this kind of URL though!
-   :-)
- - Troy Engel pointed out a bug in my getenv("HOME")
-   usage for win32 systems. I introduce getenv.c to better cope with
-   this. Mr Engel helps me with the details around that...
- - A little note to myself and others, I should make the win32-binary built
-   with SSL support...
- - Ryan Nelson sent me comments about building curl
-   with SSL under FreeBSD. See the Makefile for details. Using the configure
-   script, it should work better and automatically now...
- - Cleaned up in the port number mess in the source. No longer stores and uses
-   proxy port number separate from normal port number.
- - 'configure' script working. Confirmed compiles on:
-    Host         SSL  Compiler
-    SunOS 5.5    no   gcc
-    SunOS 5.5.1  yes  gcc
-    SunOS 5.6    no   cc  (with gcc, it has the "gcc include files" problem)
-    SunOS 4.1.3  no   gcc (without ANSI C headers)
-    SunOS 4.1.2  no   gcc (native compiler failed)
-    Linux 2.0.18 no   gcc
-    Linux 2.0.32 yes  gcc
-    Linux 2.0.35 no   gcc (with glibc)
-    IRIX 6.2     no   gcc (cc compiles generate a few warnings)
-    IRIX 6.4     no   cc  (generated warnings though)
-    Win32        no   Borland
-    OSF4.0	 no   ?
-
- - Ooops. The 5beta (and 4.10) under win32 failed if the HOME variable wasn't
-   set.
- - When using a proxy, curl now guesses and uses the protocol part in cases
-   like:
-	curl -x proxy:80 www.site.com
-   Proxies normally go nuts unless http:// is prepended to the host name, so
-   if curl is used like this, it guesses protocol and appends the protocol
-   string before passing it to the proxy. It already did this when used
-   without proxy.
- - Better port usage with SSL through proxy now. If you specified a different
-   https-port when accessing through a proxy, it didn't use that number
-   correctly. I also rewrote the code that parses the stuff read from the
-   proxy when you wanna connect through it with SSL.
- - Bjorn Reese helped me work around one of the compiler
-   warnings on IRIX native cc compiles.
-
-Version 4.10 (Oct 26, 1998)
- Daniel Stenberg
- - John A. Bristor suggested a config file switch,
-   and since I've been having that idea kind of in the background for a long
-   time I rewrote the parameter parsing function a little and now I introduce
-   the -K/--config flag. I also made curl *always* (unless -K is used) try to
-   load the .curlrc file for command line parameters. The syntax for the
-   config file is the standard command line argument style. Details in 'curl
-   -h' or the README.
- - I removed the -k option. Keep-alive isn't really anything anyone would
-   want to enable with curl anyway.
- - Martin Staael helped me add the 'irix' target. Now
-   "make irix" should build curl successfully on non-gcc SGI machines.
- - Single switches now toggle behaviours. I.e if you use -v -v the second
-   will switch off the verbose mode the first one enabled. This is so that
-   you can disable a default setting a .curlrc file enables etc.
-
-Version 4.9 (Oct 7, 1998)
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Martin Staael suggested curl would support cookies.
-   I added -b/--cookie to enable free-text cookie data to be passed. There's
-   also a little blurb about general cookie stuff in the README/help text.
- - dmh <dmh at jet.es> suggested HTTP resume capabilities. Although you could
-   manually get curl to resume HTTP documents, I made the -c resume flag work
-   for HTTP too (unless -r is used too, which would be very odd anyway).
- - Added checklinks.pl to the archive. It is a still experimental perl script
-   that checks all links of a web page by using curl.
- - Rearranged the archive hierarchy a little. Build the executable in the
-   src/ dir from now on!
- - Version 4.9 and hereafter, is no longer released under the GPL license.
-   I have now updated the LEGAL file etc and now this is released using the
-   Mozilla Public License to avoid the plague known as "the GPL virus". You
-   must make the source available if you decide to change and/or redistribute
-   curl, but if you decide to use curl within something else you do not need
-   to offer the world the source to that too.
- - Curl did not like HTTP servers that sent no headers at all on a GET
-   request.  It is a violation of RFC2068 but appearantly some servers do
-   that anyway.  Thanks to Gordon Beaton for the report!
- - -L/--location was added after a suggestion from Martin Staael. This makes
-   curl ATTEMPT to follow the Location: redirect if one is present in the HTTP
-   headers. If -i or -I is used with this flag, you will see headers from all
-   sites the Location: points to. Do note that the first server can point to a
-   second that points to a third etc. It seems the Location: parameter (said
-   to be an AbsoluteURI in RFC2068) isn't always absolute.. :-/ Anyway, I've
-   made curl ATTEMPT to do the best it can to deal with the reality.
- - Added getlinks.pl to the archive. getlinks.pl selectively downloads
-   files that a web page links to.
-
-Version 4.8.4
- Daniel Stenberg
- - As Julian Romero Nieto reported, curl reported wrong version number.
- - As Teemu Yli-Elsila pointed out, the win32 version of 4.8 (and probably all
-   other versions for win32) didn't work with binary files since I'm too used
-   to the UNIX style fopen() where binary and text don't differ...
- - Ralph Beckmann brought me some changes that lets curl compile error and
-   warning free with -Wall -pedantic with g++. I also took the opportunity to
-   clean off some unused variables and similar.
- - Ralph Beckmann made me aware of a really odd bug now corrected. When curl
-   read a set of headers from a HTTP server, divided into more than one read
-   and the first read showed a full line *exactly* (i.e ending with a
-   newline), curl did not behave well.
-
-Version 4.8.3
- Daniel Stenberg
- - I was too quick to release 4.8.2 with too little testing. One of the
-   changes is now reverted slightly to the 4.8.1 way since 4.8.2 couldn't
-   upload files. I still think both problems corrected in 4.8.2 remain
-   corrected.  Reported by Julian Romero Nieto.
-
-Version 4.8.2
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Bernhard Iselborn reported two FTP protocol errors curl did. They're now
-   corrected. Both appeared when getting files from a MS FTP server! :-)
-
-Version 4.8.1
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Added a last update of the progress meter when the transfer is done. The
-   final output on the screen didn't have to be the final size transfered
-   which made it sometimes look odd.
- - Thanks to David Long I got rid of a silly bug that happened if a HTTP-page
-   had nothing but header. Appearantly Solaris deals with negative sizes in
-   fwrite() calls a lot better than Linux does... =B-]
-
-Version 4.8
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Continue FTP file transfer. -c is the switch. Note that you need to
-   specify a file name if you wanna resume a download (you can't resume a
-   download sent to stdout). Resuming upload may be limited by the server
-   since curl is then using the non-RFC959 command SIZE to get the size of
-   the target file before upload begins (to figure out which offset to
-   use). Use -C to specify the offset yourself! -C is handy if you're doing
-   the output to something else but a plain file or when you just want to get
-   the end of a file.
- - recursiveftpget.pl now features a maximum recursive level argument.
-
-Version 4.7
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Added support to abort a download if the speed is below a certain amount
-   (speed-limit) bytes per second for a certain (speed-time) time.
- - Wrote a perl script 'recursiveftpget.pl' to recursively use curl to get a
-   whole ftp directory tree. It is meant as an example of how curl can be
-   used.  I agree it isn't the wisest thing to do to make a separate new
-   connection for each file and directory for this.
-
-Version 4.6
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Added a first attempt to optionally parse the .netrc file for login user
-   and password. If used with http, it enables user authentication. -n is
-   the new switch.
- - Removed the extra newlines on the default user-agent string.
- - Corrected the missing ftp upload error messages when it failed without the
-   verbose flag set. Gary W. Swearingen found it.
- - Now using alarm() to enable second-precision timeout even on the name
-   resolving/connecting phase. The timeout is although reset after that first
-   sequence. (This should be corrected.) Gary W. Swearingen reported.
- - Now spells "Unknown" properly, as in "Unknown option 'z'"... :-)
- - Added bug report email address in the README.
- - Added a "current speed" field to the progress meter. It shows the average
-   speed the last 5 seconds. The other speed field shows the average speed of
-   the entire transfer so far.
-
-Version 4.5.1
- Linas Vepstas
- - SSL through proxy fix
- - Added -A to allow User-Agent: changes
-
- Daniel Stenberg 
- - Made the -A work when SSL-through-proxy.
-
-Version 4.5
- Linas Vepstas
- - More SSL corrections
- - I've added a port to AIX.
- - running SSL through a proxy causes a chunk of code to be executred twice.
-   one of those blocks needs to be deleted.
-
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Made -i and -I work again
-
-Version 4.4
- Linas Vepstas
- - -x can now also specify proxyport when used as in 'proxyhost:proxyport'
- - SSL fixes
-
-Version 4.3
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Adjusted to compile under win32 (VisualC++ 5). The -P switch does not
-   support network interface names in win32. I couldn't figure out how!
-
-Version 4.2
- Linas Vepstas / Sampo Kellomaki
- - Added SSL / SSLeay support (https://)
- - Added the -T usage for HTTP POST.
-
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Bugfixed the SSL implementation.
- - Made -P a lot better to use other IP addresses. It now accepts a following
-   parameter that can be either
-        interface - i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's IP address you
-                    want to use
-        IP address - i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify exact IP number
-        host name - i.e "my.host.domain" to specify machine
-        "-"       - (any single-letter string) to make it pick the machine's
-                    default
- - The Makefile is now ready to compile for solaris, sunos4 and linux right
-   out of the box.
- - Better generated version string seen with 'curl -V'
-
-Version 4.1
- Daniel Stenberg
- - The IP number returned by the ftp server as a reply to PASV does no longer
-   have to DNS resolve. In fact, no IP-number-only addresses have to anymore.
- - Binds better to available port when -P is used.
- - Now LISTs ./ instead of / when used as in ftp://ftp.funet.fi/. The reason
-   for this is that exactly that site, ftp.funet.fi, does not allow LIST /
-   while LIST ./ is fine. Any objections?
-
-Version 4 (1998-03-20)
- Daniel Stenberg
- - I took another huge step and changed both version number and project name!
-   The reason for the new name is that there are just one too many programs
-   named urlget already and this program already can a lot more than merely
-   getting URLs, and the reason for the version number is that I did add the
-   pretty big change in -P and since I changed name I wanted to start with
-   something fresh!
- - The --style flags are working better now.
- - Listing directories with FTP often reported that the file transfer was
-   incomplete. Wrong assumptions were too common for directories, why no
-   size will be attempted to get compared on them from now on.
- - Implemented the -P flag that let's the ftp control issue a PORT command
-   instead of the standard PASV.
- - -a for appending FTP uploads works.
-
-***************************************************************************
-
-Version 3.12 (14 March 1998)
- Daniel Stenberg
- - End-of-header tracking still lacked support for \r\n or just \n at the
-   end of the last header line.
- Sergio Barresi
- - Added PROXY authentication.
- Rafael Sagula
- - Fixed some little bugs.
-
-Version 3.11
- Daniel Stenberg
- - The header parsing was still not correct since the 3.2 modification...
-
-Version 3.10
- Daniel Stenberg
- - 3.7 and 3.9 were simultaneously developed and merged into this version.
- - FTP upload did not work correctly since 3.2.
-
-Version 3.9
- Rafael Sagula
- - Added the "-e <url> / --referer <url>" option where we can specify
-   the referer page. Obviously, this is necessary only to fool the
-   server, but...
-
-Version 3.7
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Now checks the last error code sent from the ftp server after a file has
-   been received or uploaded. Wasn't done previously.
- - When 'urlget <host>' is used without a 'protocol://' first in the host part,
-   it now checks for host names starting with ftp or gopher and if it does,
-   it uses that protocol by default instead of http.
-
-Version 3.6
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Silly mistake made the POST bug. This has now also been tested to work with
-   proxy.
-
-Version 3.5
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Highly inspired by Rafael Sagula's changes to the 3.1 that added an almost
-   functional POST, I applied his changes into this version and made them work.
-   (It seems POST requires the Content-Type and Content-Length headers.) It is
-   now usable with the -d switch.
-
-Version 3.3 - 3.4
- Passed to avoid confusions
-
-Version 3.2
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Major rewrite of two crucial parts of this code: upload and download.
-   They are both now using a select() switch, that allows much better
-   progress meter and time control. 
- - alarm() usage removed completely
- - FTP get can now list directory contents if the path ends with a slash '/'.
-   Urlget on a ftp-path that doesn't end with a slash means urlget will
-   attempt getting it as a file name.
- - FTP directory view supports -l for "list-only" which lists the file names
-   only.
- - All operations support -m for max time usage in seconds allowed.
- - FTP upload now allows the size of the uploaded file to be provided, and
-   thus it can better check it actually uploaded the whole file. It also
-   makes the progress meter for uploads much better!
- - Made the parameter parsing fail in cases like 'urlget -r 900' which
-   previously tried to connect to the host named '900'.
-
-Version 3.1
- Kjell Ericson
- - Pointed out how to correct the 3 warnings in win32-compiles.
-
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Removed all calls to exit().
- - Made the short help text get written to stdout instead of stderr.
- - Made this file instead of keeping these comments in the source.
- - Made two callback hooks, that enable external programs to use urlget()
-   easier and to grab the output/offer the input easier.
- - It is evident that Win32-compiles are painful. I watched the output from
-   the Borland C++ v5 and it was awful. Just ignore all those warnings.
-
-Version 3.0
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Added FTP upload capabilities. The name urlget gets a bit silly now
-   when we can put too... =)
- - Restructured the source quite a lot.
-   Changed the urlget() interface. This way, we will survive changes much
-   better. New features can come and old can be removed without us needing
-   to change the interface. I've written a small explanation in urlget.h
-   that explains it.
- - New flags include -t, -T, -O and -h. The -h text is generated by the new
-   mkhelp script.
-
-Version 2.9
- Remco van Hooff
- - Added a fix to make it compile smoothly on Amiga using the SAS/C
-   compiler.
-  
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Believe it or not, but the STUPID Novell web server seems to require
-   that the Host: keyword is used, so well I use it and I (re-introduce) the
-   urlget User-Agent:. I still have to check that this Host: usage works with
-   proxies... 'Host:' is required for HTTP/1.1 GET according to RFC2068.
-
-Version 2.8
- Rafael Sagula
- - some little modifications
-
-Version 2.7
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Removed the -l option and introduced the -f option instead. Now I'll
-   rewrite the former -l kludge in an external script that'll use urlget to
-   fetch multipart files like that.
- - '-f' is introduced, it means Fail without output in case of HTTP server
-   errors (return code >=300).
- - Added support for -r, ranges. Specify which part of a document you 
-   want, and only that part is returned. Only with HTTP/1.1-servers.
- - Split up the source in 3 parts. Now all pure URL functions are in
-   urlget.c and stuff that deals with the stand-alone program is in main.c.
- - I took a few minutes and wrote an embryo of a README file to explain
-   a few things.
-
-Version 2.6
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Made the -l (loop) thing use the new CONF_FAILONERROR which makes
-   urlget() return error code if non-successful. It also won't output anything
-   then. Now finally removed the HTTP 1.0 and error 404 dependencies.
- - Added -I which uses the HEAD request to get the header only from a
-   http-server.
-
-Version 2.5
- Rafael Sagula
- - Made the progress meter use HHH:MM:SS instead of only seconds.
-
-Version 2.4
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Added progress meter. It appears when downloading > BUFFER SIZE and
-   mute is not selected. I found out that when downloading large files from
-   really really slow sites, it is desirable to know the status of the
-   download. Do note that some downloads are done unawaring of the size, which
-   makes the progress meter less thrilling ;) If the output is sent to a tty,
-   the progress meter is shut off.
- - Increased buffer size used for reading.
- - Added length checks in the user+passwd parsing.
- - Made it grok user+passwd for HTTP fetches. The trick is to base64
-   encode the user+passwd and send an extra header line. Read chapter 11.1 in
-   RFC2068 for details. I added it to be used just like the ftp one.  To get a
-   http document from a place that requires user and password, use an URL
-   like:
-
-        http://user:passwd@www.site.to.leach/doc.html
-
-   I also added the -u flag, since WHEN USING A PROXY YOU CAN'T SPECIFY THE
-   USER AND PASSWORD WITH HTTP LIKE THAT. The -u flag works for ftp too, but
-   not if used with proxy. To do the same as the above one, you can invoke:
-
-        urlget -u user:passwd http://www.site.to.leach/doc.html
-
-Version 2.3
- Rafael Sagula
- - Added "-o" option (output file)
- - Added URG_HTTP_NOT_FOUND return code.
-   (Daniel's note:)
-   Perhaps we should detect all kinds of errors and instead of writing that
-   custom string for the particular 404-error, use the error text we actually
-   get from the server. See further details in RFC2068 (HTTP 1.1
-   definition). The current way also relies on a HTTP/1.0 reply, which newer
-   servers might not do.
- - Looping mode ("-l" option). It's easier to get various split files.
-   (Daniel's note:)
-   Use it like 'urlget -l 1 http://from.this.site/file%d.html', which will
-   make urlget to attempt to fetch all files named file1.html, file2.html etc
-   until no more files are found. This is only a modification of the
-   STAND_ALONE part, nothing in the urlget() function was modfified for this.
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Changed the -h to be -i instead. -h should be preserved to help use.
- - Bjorn Reese indicated that Borland _might_ use '_WIN32' instead of the
-   VC++ WIN32 define and therefore I added a little fix for that.
-
-Version 2.2
- Johan Andersson
- - The urlget function didn't set the path to url when using proxy.
- - Fixed bug with IMC proxy. Now using (almost) complete GET command.
-  
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Made it compile on Solaris. Had to reorganize the includes a bit.
-   (so Win32, Linux, SunOS 4 and Solaris 2 compile fine.)
- - Made Johan's keepalive keyword optional with the -k flag (since it
-   makes a lot of urlgets take a lot longer time).
- - Made a '-h' switch in case you want the HTTP-header in the output.
-
-Version 2.1
- Daniel Stenberg and Kjell Ericson
- - Win32-compilable
- - No more global variables
- - Mute option (no output at all to stderr)
- - Full range of return codes from urlget(), which is now written to be a
-   function for easy-to-use in [other] programs.
- - Define STAND_ALONE to compile the stand alone urlget program
- - Now compiles with gcc options -ansi -Wall -pedantic ;)
-
-Version 2.0
- - Introducing ftp GET support. The FTP URL type is recognized and used.
- - Renamed the project to 'urlget'.
- - Supports the user+passwd in the FTP URL (otherwise it tries anonymous
-   login with a weird email address as password).
-
-Version 1.5
- Daniel Stenberg
- - The skip_header() crap messed it up big-time. By simply removing that
-   one we can all of a sudden download anything ;)
- - No longer requires a trailing slash on the URLs.
- - If the given URL isn't prefixed with 'http://', HTTP is assumed and
-   given a try!
- - 'void main()' is history.
-
-Version 1.4
- Daniel Stenberg
- - The gopher source used the ppath variable instead of path which could
-   lead to disaster.
-
-Version 1.3
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Well, I added a lame text about the time it took to get the data. I also
-   fought against Johan to prevent his -f option (to specify a file name
-   that should be written instead of stdout)! =)
- - Made it write 'connection refused' for that particular connect()
-   problem.
- - Renumbered the version. Let's not make silly 1.0.X versions, this is
-   a plain 1.3 instead.
-
-Version 1.2
- Johan Andersson
- - Discovered and fixed the problem with getting binary files. puts() is
-   now replaced with fwrite(). (Daniel's note: this also fixed the buffer
-   overwrite problem I found in the previous version.)
-
- Rafael Sagula
- - Let "-p" before "-x".
-
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Bugfixed the proxy usage. It should *NOT* use nor strip the port number
-   from the URL but simply pass that information to the proxy. This also
-   made the user/password fields possible to use in proxy [ftp-] URLs.
-   (like in ftp://user:password@ftp.my.site:8021/README)
-
- Johan Andersson
- - Implemented HTTP proxy support.
- - Receive byte counter added.
-
- Bjorn Reese
- - Implemented URLs (and skipped the old syntax).
- - Output is written to stdout, so to achieve the above example, do:
-   httpget http://143.54.10.6/info_logo.gif > test.gif
-
-Version 1.1
- Daniel Stenberg
- - Adjusted it slightly to accept named hosts on the command line. We
-   wouldn't wanna use IP numbers for the rest of our lifes, would we?

-Version 1.0
-  Rafael Sagula
-  - Wrote the initial httpget, which started all this!

 To Think About When Contributing Source Code
 
  This document is intended to offer some guidelines that can be useful to keep
  in mind when you decide to write a contribution to the project. This concerns
  new features as well as corrections to existing flaws or bugs.
 
 The License Issue
 
  When contributing with code, you agree to put your changes and new code under
- the same license curl and libcurl is already using. Curl uses the MozPL, the
- Mozilla Public License, which is *NOT* compatible with the well known GPL,
- GNU Public License. We can never re-use sources from a GPL program in curl.
+ the same license curl and libcurl is already using.
+
  If you add a larger piece of code, you can opt to make that file or set of
  files to use a different license as long as they don't enfore any changes to
  the rest of the package and they make sense. Such "separate parts" can not be
- GPL either (although they should use "GPL compatible" licenses).
-
- Curl and libcurl will soon become dual licensed, MozPL/MITX!
+ GPL (as we don't want the FPL virus to attack users of libcurl) but they must
+ use "GPL compatible" licenses.
 
 Naming
 
  Try using a non-confusing naming scheme for your new functions and variable
  names. It doesn't necessarily have to mean that you should use the same as in
  other places of the code, just that the names should be logical,
@@ -69,12 +65,19 @@
  extract the single interesting patch from somewhere within the huge pile of
  source, and that gives a lot of extra work. Preferably, all fixes that
  correct different problems should be in their own patch with an attached
  description exactly what they correct so that all patches can be selectively
  applied by the maintainer or other interested parties.
 
+Patch Against Recent Sources
+
+ Please try to get the latest available sources to make your patches
+ against. It makes my life so much easier. The very best is if you get the
+ most up-to-date sources from the CVS repository, but the latest release
+ archive is quite OK as well!
+
 Document
 
  Writing docs is dead boring and one of the big problems with many open source
  projects. Someone's gotta do it. It makes it a lot easier if you submit a
  small description of your fix or your new features with every contribution so
  that it can be swiftly added to the package documentation.

 Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly done CGIs
 fail if its not set to "Mozilla/4.0".  To encode blanks in the string,
 surround the string with single quote marks.  This can also be set with the

 .IP "-B/--use-ascii"
 Use ASCII transfer when getting an FTP file or LDAP info. For FTP, this can
 also be enforced by using an URL that ends with ";type=A". This option causes
 data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

 want to post a binary file without the strip-newlines feature of the
 --data-ascii option, this is for you.

 .IP "-D/--dump-header <file>"
 (HTTP/FTP)
 Write the HTTP headers to this file. Write the FTP file info to this
 file if -I/--head is used.
 
 This option is handy to use when you want to store the cookies that a HTTP
 site sends to you. The cookies could then be read in a second curl invoke by
 using the -b/--cookie option!

 .IP "-e/--referer <URL>"
 (HTTP) Sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also
 be set with the -H/--header flag of course.  When used with
 .I -L/--location 
 you can append ";auto" to the referer URL to make curl automatically set the
 previous URL when it follows a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be
 used alone, even if you don't set an initial referer.

+If this option is used serveral times, the last one will be used.
 .IP "-E/--cert <certificate[:password]>"
 (HTTPS)
 Tells curl to use the specified certificate file when getting a file
 with HTTPS. The certificate must be in PEM format.
 If the optional password isn't specified, it will be queried for on
 the terminal. Note that this certificate is the private key and the private
 certificate concatenated!

 (HTTPS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the
 peer. The certificate must be in PEM format.

 Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly done
 like this to better enable scripts etc to better deal with failed
 attempts. In normal cases when a HTTP server fails to deliver a
 document, it returns a HTML document stating so (which often also
 describes why and more). This flag will prevent curl from
 outputting that and fail silently instead.

+If this option is used twice, the second will again disable silent failure.
 .IP "-F/--form <name=content>"
 (HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled in form in which a user has pressed the
 submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the content-type
 multipart/form-data according to RFC1867. This enables uploading of binary
 files etc. To force the 'content' part to be be a file, prefix the file name

 .IP "-H/--header <header>"
 (HTTP) Extra header to use when getting a web page. You may specify any number
 of extra headers. Note that if you should add a custom header that has the
 same name as one of the internal ones curl would use, your externally set
 header will be used instead of the internal one. This allows you to make even
 trickier stuff than curl would normally do. You should not replace internally
 set headers without knowing perfectly well what you're doing. Replacing an
 internal header with one without content on the right side of the colon will
 prevent that header from appearing.

+This option can be used multiple times.
 .IP "-i/--include"
 (HTTP)
 Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header includes things
 like server-name, date of the document, HTTP-version and more...

+If this option is used twice, the second will again disable header include.
 .IP "--interface <name>"
 Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can enter interface
 name, IP address or host name. An example could look like:

 Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD
 which this uses to get nothing but the header of a document. When used
 on a FTP file, curl displays the file size only.

 .IP "-l/--list-only"
 (FTP)
 When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a name-only view.
 Especially useful if you want to machine-parse the contents of an FTP
 directory since the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look
 or format.

+If this option is used twice, the second will again disable list only.
 .IP "-L/--location"
 (HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page has a different
 location (indicated with the header line Location:) this flag will let curl
 attempt to reattempt the get on the new place. If used together with -i or -I,
 headers from all requested pages will be shown. If this flag is used when
 making a HTTP POST, curl will automatically switch to GET after the initial
 POST has been done.

 will use a standard buffered output stream that will have the effect that it
 will output the data in chunks, not necessarily exactly when the data arrives.

 Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch
 multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number in the <file>
 specifier. That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL
 being fetched. Like in:

 6. License Issues
 
-  Curl and libcurl are released under the MPL, the Mozilla Public License. To
-  get a really good answer to your license conflict questions, you should
-  study the MPL license and the license you are about to use and check for
-  clashes yourself. This section is just a brief summary for the cases we get
-  the most questions. (Parts of this section was much enhanced by Bjorn
-  Reese.)
+  NOTE: This section is now updated to concern curl 7.5.2 or later!
+
+  Curl and libcurl are released under a MIT/X derivate license *or* the MPL,
+  the Mozilla Public License. To get a really good answer to your license
+  conflict questions, you should study the MPL and MIT/X licenses and the
+  license you are about to use and check for clashes yourself. This section is
+  just a brief summary for the cases we get the most questions. (Parts of this
+  section was much enhanced by Bjorn Reese.)
 
   6.1. I have a GPL program, can I use the libcurl library?
 
-  No, unfortunately you cannot distribute the (lib)curl code with your code.
-  According to both the Free Software Foundation and the Mozilla
-  Organization, MPL and GPL are not compatible, because GPL requires of
-  other licenses that they do "not impose any further restrictions on the
-  recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein" [GPL paragraph 6] (One
-  could argue about which license that actually imposes restrictions, but
-  that'll be left for you to ponder about.)
-
-  However, you have two alternative options:
-
-    1) Nothing prevents you from distributing your program separately from
-       curl and libcurl, and request that the user receives it separately.
-       The incompability issues between MPL and GPL only applies to the
-       distribution.
-
-    2) Add the following exception to your distribution (you must have the
-       consent of all the copyright holders of the source code in your
-       project in order to do this) 
-
-         As a special exception, you have permission to link this program
-         with the curl library and distribute executables, as long as you
-         follow the requirements of the GNU GPL in regard to all of the
-         software in the executable aside from curl.
-
-       This exception must be added to your GPL covered source code files
-       immediately after the notification mentioned in the appendix of GPL.
-       The wording was originally suggested by the Free Software Foundation
-       in relationship with the Qt library. We have changed the wording to
-       apply to curl.
+  Yes!
+
+  Since libcurl may be distributed under the MIT/X derivate license, it can be
+  used together with GPL in any software.
 
   6.2. I have a closed-source program, can I use the libcurl library?
 
-  Yes, libcurl does not put any restrictions on the program that uses the
-  library. If you end up doing changes to the library, only those changes must
-  be made available, not the ones to your program.
+  Yes.
+
+  libcurl does not put any restrictions on the program that uses the
+  library.
 
   6.3. I have a BSD licensed program, can I use the libcurl library?
 
-  Yes, libcurl does not put any restrictions on the program that uses the
-  library. If you end up doing changes to the library, only those changes must
-  be made available, not the ones to your program.
+  Yes.
+
+  libcurl does not put any restrictions on the program that uses the
+  library.
 
   6.4. I have a program that uses LGPL libraries, can I use libcurl?
 
-  Yes you can. LGPL libraries don't spread to other libraries the same way GPL
-  ones do.
+  Yes.
 
-  However, when you read paragraph (3) of the LGPL license, you'll see that
-  anyone - at will - may at any time convert that LGPL program into GPL. And
-  GPL programs can't be distributed together with MPL programs, neither with
-  (lib)curl source code and not as a binary.
+  The LGPL license don't clash with other licenses.
 
   6.5. Can I modify curl/libcurl for my program and keep the changes secret?
 
-  No, you're not allowed to do that.
+  Yes.
+
+  The MIT/X derivate license practically allows you to do almost anything with
+  the sources, on the condition that the copyright texts in the sources are
+  left intact.
 
   6.6. Can you please change the curl/libcurl license to XXXX?
 
   No. We carefully picked this license years ago and a large amount of people
   have contributed with source code knowing that this is the license we
   use. This license puts the restrictions we want on curl/libcurl and it does
-  not spread to other programs or libraries that use it.
+  not spread to other programs or libraries that use it. The recent dual
+  license modification should make it possible for everyone to use libcurl or
+  curl in their projects, no matter what license they already have in use.

-   Alternatively, and preferably, we rewrite the entire config file to become

-        [option] = [value]

-
-   [value] could be written as plain text, and then the initial and trailing
-   white spaces would be stripped off, or it can be specified within quotes
-   and then all white spaces within the quotes will count.
-
-   [value] could then be made to accept some format to specify an environment
-   variable. I could even think of supporting
-
-        [option] += [value]
