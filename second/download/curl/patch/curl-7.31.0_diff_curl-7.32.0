+Daniel Stenberg (11 Aug 2013)
+- THANKS: added contributors from the 7.32.0 release notes
 
-- Curl_urldecode: no peeking beyond end of input buffer
-  
-  Security problem: CVE-2013-2174
-  
-  If a program would give a string like "%FF" to curl_easy_unescape() but
-  ask for it to decode only the first byte, it would still parse and
-  decode the full hex sequence. The function then not only read beyond the
-  allowed buffer but it would also deduct the *unsigned* counter variable
-  for how many more bytes there's left to read in the buffer by two,
-  making the counter wrap. Continuing this, the function would go on
-  reading beyond the buffer and soon writing beyond the allocated target
-  buffer...

-- multi_socket: react on socket close immediately
-  
-  As a remedy to the problem when a socket gets closed and a new one is
-  opened with the same file descriptor number and as a result
-  multi.c:singlesocket() doesn't detect the difference, the new function
-  Curl_multi_closed() gets told when a socket is closed so that it can be
-  removed from the socket hash. When the old one has been removed, a new
-  socket should be detected fine by the singlesocket() on next invoke.

-  Patched-by: Nach M. S.
+  The previous naming scheme ftp_state_post_XXXX() wasn't really helpful

+  This new one is instead ftp_state_yyyy() where yyyy describes what it

-- multi_socket: reduce timeout inaccuracy margin
+- mk-ca-bundle.1: don't install on make install
   
-  Allow less room for "triggered too early" mistakes by applications /
-  timers on non-windows platforms. Starting now, we assume that a timeout
-  call is never made earlier than 3 milliseconds before the actual
-  timeout. This greatly improves timeout accuracy on Linux.
+  Since the mk-ca-bundle tool itself isn't installed with make install,

-- cert_stuff: avoid double free in the PKCS12 code
+Yang Tse (7 Aug 2013)
+- packages/vms/Makefile.am: add latest file additions to EXTRA_DIST
+
+- [John Malmberg brought this change]
+
+  Building_vms_pcsi_kit
   
-  In the pkcs12 code, we get a list of x509 records returned from
-  PKCS12_parse but when iterating over the list and passing each to
-  SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert() we didn't also properly remove them from
-  the "stack", which made them get freed twice (both in sk_X509_pop_free()
-  and then later in SSL_CTX_free).
+  These are the files needed to build VMS distribution packages known as
+  PCSI kits.
   
-  This isn't really documented anywhere...
+  Also minor update to the existing files, mainly to the documentation and
+  file clean up code.

+- LIBCURL-STRUCTS: new document
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1236
-  Reported-by: Nikaiw
+  This is the first version of this new document, detailing the seven
+  perhaps most important internal structs in libcurl source code:
+  
+    1.1 SessionHandle
+    1.2 connectdata
+    1.3 Curl_multi
+    1.4 Curl_handler
+    1.5 conncache

-- cert_stuff: remove code duplication in the pkcs12 logic
+- CONTRIBUTE: minor language polish
 
-- [Aleksey Tulinov brought this change]
+- FTP: when EPSV gets a 229 but fails to connect, retry with PASV
+  
+  This is a regression as this logic used to work. It isn't clear when it
+  broke, but I'm assuming in 7.28.0 when we went all-multi internally.
+  
+  This likely never worked with the multi interface. As the failed
+  connection is detected once the multi state has reached DO_MORE, the
+  Curl_do_more() function was now expanded somewhat so that the
+  ftp_do_more() function can request to go "back" to the previous state
+  when it makes another attempt - using PASV.
+  
+  Added test case 1233 to verify this fix. It has the little issue that it
+  assumes no service is listening/accepting connections on port 1...

-  axtls: honor disabled VERIFYHOST
+Nick Zitzmann (5 Aug 2013)
+- md5: remove use of CommonCrypto-to-OpenSSL macros for the benefit of Leopard
   
-  When VERIFYHOST == 0, libcurl should let invalid certificates to pass.
+  For some reason, OS X 10.5's GCC suddenly stopped working correctly with
+  macros that change MD5_Init etc. in the code to CC_MD5_Init etc., so I
+  worked around this by removing use of the macros and inserting static
+  functions that just call CommonCrypto's implementations of the functions
+  instead.

+Guenter Knauf (5 Aug 2013)
+- Simplify check for trusted certificates.
+  
+  This changes the previous check for untrusted certs to a check for
+  certs explicitely marked as trusted.
+  The change is backward-compatible (tested with certdata.txt v1.80).
 
-  curl_easy_setopt.3: HTTP header with no content
+Daniel Stenberg (5 Aug 2013)
+- configure: warn on bad env variable use, don't error
   
-  Update the documentation on how to specify a HTTP header with no
-  content.
+  Use XC_CHECK_BUILD_FLAGS instead XC_CHECK_USER_FLAGS.
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 87cf677eca55
+- Revert "configure: don't error out on variable confusions, just warn"
   
-  Added 11 bugs and 7 contributors
+  This reverts commit 6b27703b5f525eccdc0a8409f51de8595c75132a.
 
-- lib1500: remove bad check
+- formadd: wrong pointer for file name when CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR used
   
-  After curl_multi_wait() returns, this test checked that we got exactly
-  one file descriptor told to read from, but we cannot be sure that is
-  true. curl_multi_wait() will sometimes return earlier without any file
-  descriptor to handle, just just because it is a suitable time to call
-  *perform().
+  The internal function that's used to detect known file extensions for
+  the default Content-Type got the the wrong pointer passed in when
+  CURLFORM_BUFFER + CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR were used. This had the effect that
+  strlen() would be used which could lead to an out-of-bounds read (and
+  thus segfault). In most cases it would only lead to it not finding or
+  using the correct default content-type.
   
-  This problem showed up with commit 29bf0598.
+  It also showed that test 554 and test 587 were testing for the
+  previous/wrong behavior and now they're updated as well.

-- test1230: verify CONNECT to a numerical ipv6-address
+Daniel Stenberg (4 Aug 2013)
+- configure: don't error out on variable confusions, just warn
 
-- sws: support extracting test number from CONNECT ipv6-address!
+- configure: rephrase the notice in _XC_CHECK_VAR_*
   
-  If an ipv6-address is provided to CONNECT, the last hexadecimal group in
-  the address will be used as the test number! For example the address
-  "[1234::ff]" would be treated as test case 255.
+  Instead of claiming it is an error, we call it a "note" to reduce the
+  severity level. But the following text now says the [variable] "*should*
+  only be used to specify"... instead of previously having said "may".
 
-- curl_multi_wait: only use internal timer if not -1
+- multi: remove data->state.current_conn struct field
   
-  commit 29bf0598aad5 introduced a problem when the "internal" timeout is
-  prefered to the given if shorter, as it didn't consider the case where
-  -1 was returned. Now the internal timeout is only considered if not -1.
+  Not needed
+
+- multi: remove the one_easy struct field
   
-  Reported-by: Tor Arntsen
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-06/0015.html
+  Since the merge of SessionHandle with Curl_one_easy, this indirection
+  isn't used anymore.
 
-Dan Fandrich (3 Jun 2013)
-- libcurl-tutorial.3: added a section on IPv6
+- multi: rename all Curl_one_easy to SessionHandle
+
+- multi: remove the multi_pos struct field
   
-  Also added a (correctly-escaped) backslash to the autoexec.bat
-  example file and a new Windows character device name with
-  a colon as examples of other characters that are special
-  and potentially dangerous (this reverts and reworks commit
-  7d8d2a54).
+  Since Curl_one_easy is really a SessionHandle now, this indirection
+  doesn't exist anymore.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (3 Jun 2013)
-- curl_multi_wait: reduce timeout if the multi handle wants to
+- multi: remove easy_handle struct field
   
-  If the multi handle's pending timeout is less than what is passed into
-  this function, it will now opt to use the shorter time anyway since it
-  is a very good hint that the handle wants to process something in a
-  shorter time than what otherwise would happen.
+  It isn't needed anymore
+
+- multi: remove 'Curl_one_easy' struct, phase 1
   
-  curl_multi_wait.3 was updated accordingly to clarify
+  The motivation for having a separate struct that keep track of an easy
+  handle when using the multi handle was removed when we switched to
+  always using the multi interface internally. Now they were just two
+  separate struct that was always allocated for each easy handle.
   
-  This is the reason for bug #1224
+  This first step just moves the Curl_one_easy struct members into the
+  SessionHandle struct and hides this somehow (== keeps the source code
+  changes to a minimum) by defining Curl_one_easy to SessionHandle
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1224
-  Reported-by: Andrii Moiseiev
+  The biggest changes in this commit are:
+  
+   1 - the linked list of easy handles had to be changed somewhat due
+       to the new struct layout. This made the main linked list pointer
+       get renamed to 'easyp' and there's also a new pointer to the last
+       node, called easylp. It is no longer circular but ends with ->next
+       pointing to NULL. New nodes are still added last.
+  
+   2 - easy->state is now called easy->mstate to avoid name collision

+- curl: --progress-bar max update frequency now at 5Hz
 
-  ossl_send: SSL_write() returning 0 is an error too
+- curl: make --progress-bar update the line less frequently
   
-  We found that in specific cases if the connection is abruptly closed,
-  the underlying socket is listed in a close_wait state. We continue to
-  call the curl_multi_perform, curl_mutli_fdset etc. None of these APIs
-  report the socket closed / connection finished.  Since we have cases
-  where the multi connection is only used once, this can pose a problem
-  for us. I've read that if another connection was to come in, curl would
-  see the socket as bad and attempt to close it at that time -
-  unfortunately, this does not work for us.
+  Also, use memset() instead of a lame loop.
   
-  I found that in specific situations, if SSL_write returns 0, curl did
-  not recognize the socket as closed (or errored out) and did not report
-  it to the application. I believe we need to change the code slightly, to
-  check if ssl_write returns 0. If so, treat it as an error - the same as
-  a negative return code.
+  The previous logic that tried to avoid too many updates were very
+  ineffective for really fast transfers, as then it could easily end up
+  doing hundreds of updates per second that would make a significant
+  impact in transfer performance!

+- darwinssl: fix build error in crypto authentication under Snow Leopard
   
-  2 - don't skip domain names based on number of dots. The original
-  netscape cookie spec had this oddity mentioned and while our code
-  decreased the check to only check for two, the existing cookie spec has
-  no such dot counting required.
+  It turns out Snow Leopard not only has SecItemCopyMatching() defined in

-  cookies: only consider full path matches
+  curl_formadd: fix file upload on VMS
   
-  I found a bug which cURL sends cookies to the path not to aim at.
-  For example:
-  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hoge/
-  - server returns cookie which with path=/hoge;
-    the point is there is NOT the '/' end of path string.
-  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hogege/ with the cookie.
+  For the standard VMS text file formats, VMS needs to read the file to
+  get the actual file size.
   
-  The reason for this old "feature" is because that behavior is what is
-  described in the original netscape cookie spec:
-  http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html
+  For the standard VMS binary file formats, VMS needs a special format of
+  fopen() call so that it stops reading at the logical end of file instead
+  of at the end of the blocks allocated to the file.
   
-  The current cookie spec (RFC6265) clarifies the situation:
-  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.2.4

+- formadd: CURLFORM_FILECONTENT wrongly rejected some option combos
   
-  We don't have any code anywhere in libcurl (or the curl tool) that use

-  problems with the Borland compiler though that we may avoid by reverting
-  this change again.
+  The code for CURLFORM_FILECONTENT had its check for duplicate options
+  wrong so that it would reject CURLFORM_PTRNAME if used in combination
+  with it (but not CURLFORM_COPYNAME)! The flags field used for this
+  purpose cannot be interpreted that broadly.

+  
+  This should have minor impact as if the file does not exist, it was

+  
+  2. Fix file uploads are now fixed.
+  
+     a. VMS binary files such as ZIP archives are now uploaded
+        correctly.
+  
+     b. VMS text files are read once to get the correct size
+        and then converted to line-feed terminated records as
+        they are read into curl.
+  
+  The default VMS text formats do not contain either line-feed or

-  ... which was missed in commit: f5c3d9538452
+  CURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION is now the preferred progress callback function
+  and CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION is considered deprecated.
+  
+  This new callback uses pure 'curl_off_t' arguments to pass on full
+  resolution sizes. It otherwise retains the same characteristics: the
+  same call rate, the same meanings for the arguments and the return code
+  is used the same way.
+  
+  The progressfunc.c example is updated to show how to use the new
+  callback for newer libcurls while supporting the older one if built with
+  an older libcurl or even built with a newer libcurl while running with
+  an older.

+- Reinstate "WIN32 MemoryTracking: track wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() usage".
+  
+  This reverts commit 7ed25cc, reinstating commit 8ec2cb5.
+  
+  As of 18-jul-2013 we still do have code in libcurl that makes use of these
+  memory functions. Commit 8ec2cb5 comment still applies and is yet valid.
+  
+  These memory functions are solely used in Windows builds, so all related
+  code is protected with '#ifdef WIN32' preprocessor conditional compilation
+  directives.
+  
+  Specifically, wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used when building a Windows target with
+  UNICODE and USE_WINDOWS_SSPI preprocessor symbols defined. This is the case
+  when building a Windows UNICODE target with Windows native SSL/TLS support
+  enabled.
+  
+  Realizing that wcsdup() _wcsdup() are used is a bit tricky given that usage
+  of these is hidden behind _tcsdup() which is MS way of dealing with code
+  that must tolerate UNICODE and non-UNICODE compilation. Additionally, MS
+  header files and those compatible from other compilers use this preprocessor
+  conditional compilation directive in order to select at compilation time
+  whether 'wide' or 'ansi' MS API functions are used.
+  
+  Without this code, Windows build targets with Windows native SSL/TLS support
+  enabled and MemoryTracking support enabled misbehave in tracking memory usage,
+  regardless of being a UNICODE enabled build or not.

-- curl_easy_init: use less mallocs
+- formpost: better random boundaries
   
-  By introducing an internal alternative to curl_multi_init() that accepts
-  parameters to set the hash sizes, easy handles will now use tiny socket
-  and connection hash tables since it will only ever add a single easy
-  handle to that multi handle.
-  
-  This decreased the number mallocs in test 40 (which is a rather simple
-  and typical easy interface use case) from 1142 to 138. The maximum
-  amount of memory allocated used went down from 118969 to 78805.

-- ftpserver.pl: Fixed imap logout confirmation data
+  When doing multi-part formposts, libcurl used a pseudo-random value that
+  was seeded with time(). This turns out to be bad for users who formpost
+  data that is provided with users who then can guess how the boundary
+  string will look like and then they can forge a different formpost part
+  and trick the receiver.
   
-  An IMAP server should response with the BYE continuation response before
-  confirming the LOGOUT command was successful.

-- ftp_state_pasv_resp: connect through proxy also when set by env
+  My advice to such implementors is (still even after this change) to not
+  rely on the boundary strings being cryptographically strong. Fix your
+  code and logic to not depend on them that much!
   
-  When connecting back to an FTP server after having sent PASV/EPSV,
-  libcurl sometimes didn't use the proxy properly even though the proxy
-  was used for the initial connect.
+  I moved the Curl_rand() function into the sslgen.c source file now to be
+  able to take advantage of the SSL library's random function if it
+  provides one. If not, try to use the RANDOM_FILE for seeding and as a
+  last resort keep the old logic, just modified to also add microseconds
+  which makes it harder to properly guess the exact seed.
   
-  The function wrongly checked for the CURLOPT_PROXY variable to be set,
-  which made it act wrongly if the proxy information was set with an
-  environment variable.
+  The formboundary() function in formdata.c is now using 64 bit entropy
+  for the boundary and therefore the string of dashes was reduced by 4
+  letters and there are 16 hex digits following it. The total length is
+  thus still the same.
   
-  Added test case 711 to verify (based on 707 which uses --socks5). Also
-  added test712 to verify another variation of setting the proxy: with
-  --proxy socks5://

+  When using %x, the number must be treated as unsigned as otherwise it
+  would get sign-extended on for example 64bit machines and do wrong

-- test1218: another cookie tailmatch test
+  We found that in specific cases if the connection is abruptly closed,
+  the underlying socket is listed in a close_wait state. We continue to
+  call the curl_multi_perform, curl_mutli_fdset etc. None of these APIs
+  report the socket closed / connection finished.  Since we have cases
+  where the multi connection is only used once, this can pose a problem
+  for us. I've read that if another connection was to come in, curl would
+  see the socket as bad and attempt to close it at that time -
+  unfortunately, this does not work for us.
   
-  ... and make 1216 also verify it with a file input
+  I found that in specific situations, if SSL_write returns 0, curl did
+  not recognize the socket as closed (or errored out) and did not report
+  it to the application. I believe we need to change the code slightly, to
+  check if ssl_write returns 0. If so, treat it as an error - the same as
+  a negative return code.
   
-  These tests verify commit 3604fde3d3c9b0d, the fix for the "cookie

-  FTP: handle "rubbish" in front of directory name in 257 responses
+  cookies: only consider full path matches
   
-  When doing PWD, there's a 257 response which apparently some servers
-  prefix with a comment before the path instead of after it as is
-  otherwise the norm.
+  I found a bug which cURL sends cookies to the path not to aim at.
+  For example:
+  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hoge/
+  - server returns cookie which with path=/hoge;
+    the point is there is NOT the '/' end of path string.
+  - cURL sends a request to http://example.fake/hogege/ with the cookie.
   
-  Failing to parse this, several otherwise legitimate use cases break.
+  The reason for this old "feature" is because that behavior is what is
+  described in the original netscape cookie spec:
+  http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html

-  testsuite scripts not being able to signal or control the server
-  processes. The MinGW Perl runtime only sees the Msys processes and
-  their corresponding PIDs, but sockfilt (and other servers) wrote the
-  Windows PID into their PID-files. Since this PID is useless to the
-  testsuite, the write_pidfile function was changed to search for the
-  Msys PID and write that into the PID-file.
+  Updated test903 and test904 following the addition of CURLOPT_SASL_IR
+  as the default behaviour of SMTP AUTH responses is now to not include
+  the initial response. New tests with --sasl-ir support to follow.

+- imap: Added support for overriding the SASL initial response
   
-  3 more bug fixes, 6 more contributors
+  In addition to checking for the SASL-IR capability the user can override
+  the sending of the client's initial response in the AUTHENTICATION
+  command with the use of CURLOPT_SASL_IR should the server erroneously
+  not report SASL-IR when it does support it.

+- curl_easy_init: use less mallocs
   
-  ... so that it adheres to the API documentation.
+  By introducing an internal alternative to curl_multi_init() that accepts
+  parameters to set the hash sizes, easy handles will now use tiny socket
+  and connection hash tables since it will only ever add a single easy
+  handle to that multi handle.
   
-  Reported by: Tomas Mlcoch
+  This decreased the number mallocs in test 40 (which is a rather simple
+  and typical easy interface use case) from 1142 to 138. The maximum
+  amount of memory allocated used went down from 118969 to 78805.

-- lib1509.c: fix compiler warnings
+  When connecting back to an FTP server after having sent PASV/EPSV,
+  libcurl sometimes didn't use the proxy properly even though the proxy
+  was used for the initial connect.
+  
+  The function wrongly checked for the CURLOPT_PROXY variable to be set,
+  which made it act wrongly if the proxy information was set with an
+  environment variable.
+  
+  Added test case 711 to verify (based on 707 which uses --socks5). Also
+  added test712 to verify another variation of setting the proxy: with

+Daniel Stenberg (23 Apr 2013)
+- HISTORY: correct some years/dates
   
-  The Microsoft knowledge-base article
-  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823764 describes how to use SNDBUF to
-  overcome a performance shortcoming in winsock, but it doesn't apply to
-  Windows Vista and later versions. If the described SNDBUF magic is
-  applied when running on those more recent Windows versions, it seems to
-  instead have the reversed effect in many cases and thus make libcurl
-  perform less good on those systems.
+  Thanks to archive.org's wayback machine I updated this document with
+  some facts from the early httpget/urlget web page:
   
-  This fix thus adds a run-time version-check that does the SNDBUF magic
-  conditionally depending if it is deemed necessary or not.

-  CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of running connections
-  to the same host. When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
-  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
-  finished, so we can reuse the connection.
+  As well as parsing the username and password from the URL, added support
+  for parsing the optional options part from the login details, to allow
+  the following supported URL format:
   
-  CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of connections in total.
-  When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
-  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
-  finished. The free connection will then be reused, if possible, or
-  closed if the pending handle can't reuse it.
+  schema://username:password;options@example.com/path?q=foobar
   
-  Several new options for pipelining:
+  This will only be used by IMAP, POP3 and SMTP at present but any
+  protocol that may be given login options in the URL will be able to
+  add support for them.
+
+- smtp: Fix compiler warning
   
-  CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH - Limits the pipeling length. If a
-  pipeline is "full" when a connection is to be reused, a new connection
-  will be opened if the CURLMOPT_MAX_xxx_CONNECTIONS limits allow it.
-  If not, the handle will be put in a pending state until a connection is
-  ready (either free or a pipe got shorter).

+  ...instead of the 220 we otherwise expect.
   
-  CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - A pipelined connection will not

+- Curl_open: restore default MAXCONNECTS to 5
   
-  Commit 198012ee inadvertently broke LIST_imap().
+  At some point recently we lost the default value for the easy handle's

+- easy: Fix the broken CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS option
   
-  Enriched IMAP capabilities of ftpserver.pl in order to be able to
-  add tests for the new IMAP features.
+  Copy the CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS option to CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS in
+  curl_easy_perform().
   
-  * Added support for APPEND - Saves uploaded data to log/upload.$testno
-  * Added support for LIST - Returns the contents of <reply/> section in
-    the current test, like e.g FETCH.
-  * Added support for STORE - Returns hardcoded updated flags
-  * Changed handling of SELECT - Returns much more information in the
-    usual set of untagged responses; uses hardcoded data from an example
-    in the IMAP RFC
-  * Changed handling of FETCH - Fixed response format
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1212
+  Reported-by: Steven Gu
 
-- imap: Added check for empty UID in FETCH command
-  
-  As the UID has to be specified by the user for the FETCH command to work
-  correctly, added a check to imap_fetch(), although strictly speaking it
-  is protected by the call from imap_perform().

-- nss: fix misplaced code enabling non-blocking socket mode
-  
-  The option needs to be set on the SSL socket.  Setting it on the model
-  takes no effect.  Note that the non-blocking mode is still not enabled

-- AddFormData: prevent only directories from being posted
-  
-  Commit f4cc54cb4746ae5a6d (shipped as part of the 7.29.0 release) was a
-  bug fix that introduced a regression in that while trying to avoid
-  allowing directory names, it also forbade "special" files like character
-  devices and more. like "/dev/null" as was used by Oliver who reported
-  this regression.

-- darwinssl: fix infinite loop if server disconnected abruptly
+- SO_SNDBUF: don't set SNDBUF for win32 versions vista or later
   
-  If the server hung up the connection without sending a closure alert,
-  then we'd keep probing the socket for data even though it's dead. Now
-  we're ready for this situation.
+  The Microsoft knowledge-base article
+  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823764 describes how to use SNDBUF to
+  overcome a performance shortcoming in winsock, but it doesn't apply to
+  Windows Vista and later versions. If the described SNDBUF magic is
+  applied when running on those more recent Windows versions, it seems to
+  instead have the reversed effect in many cases and thus make libcurl
+  perform less good on those systems.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-03/0014.html
-  Reported by: Aki Koskinen
+  This fix thus adds a run-time version-check that does the SNDBUF magic
+  conditionally depending if it is deemed necessary or not.

-- pop3: Updated the coding style for state changes after a send operation
+- BINDINGS: BBHTTP is a cocoa binding, Julia has a binding
+
+- ftp_sendquote: use PPSENDF, not FTPSENDF
   
-  Some state changes would be performed after a failure test that
-  performed a hard return, whilst others would be performed within a test
-  for success. Updated the code, for consistency, so all instances are
-  performed within a success test.
+  The last remaining code piece that still used FTPSENDF now uses PPSENDF.
+  In the problematic case, a PREQUOTE series was done on a re-used
+  connection when Curl_pp_init() hadn't been called so it had messed up
+  pointers. The init call is done properly from Curl_pp_sendf() so this
+  change fixes this particular crash.

-  Changed imap_select_resp() to invoke imap_custom() instead of
-  imap_fetch() after the mailbox has been selected if a custom
-  command has been set.
+  Modified sws to support and use custom CONNECT responses instead of the
+  previously naive hard-coded version. Made the HTTP test server able to
+  extract test case number from the host name in a CONNECT request by

+- NTLM: fix several NTLM code paths memory leaks
 
-  imap: Added custom request perform and response handler functions
+- WIN32 MemoryTracking: track wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() usage
   
-  Added imap_custom(), which initiates the custom command processing,
-  and an associated response handler imap_state_custom_resp(), which
-  handles any responses by sending them to the client as body data.
+  As of 25-mar-2013 wcsdup() _wcsdup() and _tcsdup() are only used in
+  WIN32 specific code, so tracking of these has not been extended for
+  other build targets. Without this fix, memory tracking system on
+  WIN32 builds, when using these functions, would provide misleading
+  results.
   
-  All untagged responses with the same name as the first word of the
-  custom request string are accepted, with the exception of SELECT and
-  EXAMINE which have responses that cannot be easily identified. An
-  extra check has been provided for them so that any untagged responses
-  are accepted for them.
-
-- pop3: Fixed unnecessary parent structure reference
+  In order to properly extend this support for all targets curl.h
+  would have to define curl_wcsdup_callback prototype and consequently
+  wchar_t should be visible before that in curl.h.  IOW curl_wchar_t
+  defined in curlbuild.h and this pulling whatever system header is
+  required to get wchar_t definition.
   
-  Updated pop3 code following recent imap changes.
-
-- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
+  Additionally a new curl_global_init_mem() function that also receives
+  user defined wcsdup() callback would be required.
 
-  imap: Added custom request parsing
+- curl_ntlm_msgs.c: revert commit 463082bea4
   
-  Added imap_parse_custom_request() for parsing the CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST
-  parameter which URL decodes the value and separates the request from
-  any parameters - This makes it easier to filter untagged responses
-  by the request command.
-

-- imap: Minor code tidy up

-  Minor tidy up of code layout and comments following recent changes.

+  CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE before this change.

-- imap: Simplified the imap_state_append_resp() function
+Steve Holme (21 Mar 2013)
+- sasl: Corrected a few violations of the curl coding standards
   
-  Introduced the result code variable to simplify the state changes and
-  remove the hard returns.
+  Corrected some incorrectly positioned pointer variable declarations to
+  be "char *" rather than "char* ".
 
-- imap: Changed successful response logic in imap_state_append_resp()
+- multi.c: Corrected a couple of violations of the curl coding standards
   
-  For consistency changed the logic of the imap_state_append_resp()
-  function to test for an unsucessful continuation response rather than a
-  succesful one.
+  Corrected some incorrectly positioned pointer variable declarations to
+  be "type *" rather than "type* ".
 
-- imap: Standardised imapcode condition tests
+- imap-tests: Added CRLF to reply data to be compliant with RFC-822
   
-  For consistency changed two if(constant != imapcode) tests to be

-  imap: Implemented APPEND final processing
+  build_vms.com: use existing curlbuild.h and parsing fix
   
-  The APPEND operation needs to be performed in several steps:
-    1) We send "<tag> APPEND <mailbox> <flags> {<size>}\r\n"
-    2) Server responds with continuation respose "+ ...\r\n"
-    3) We start the transfer and send <size> bytes of data
-    4) Only now we end the request command line by sending "\r\n"
-    5) Server responds with "<tag> OK ...\r\n"
+  This patch removes building curlbuild.h from the build_vms.com procedure
+  and uses the one in the daily or release tarball instead.
   
-  This commit performs steps 4 and 5, in the DONE phase, as more
-  processing is required after the transfer.

-
-  imap: Added APPEND perform and response handler functions
+  packages/vms/build_curlbuild_h.com is obsolete with this change.
   
-  Added imap_append() function to initiate upload and imap_append_resp()
-  to handle the continuation response and start the transfer.
+  Accessing the library module name "tool_main" needs different handling
+  when the optional extended parsing is enabled.

+- HTTP proxy: insert slash in URL if missing
   
-  A typical FETCH response can be broken down into four parts:
+  curl has been accepting URLs using slightly wrong syntax for a long
+  time, such as when completely missing as slash "http://example.org" or
+  missing a slash when a query part is given
+  "http://example.org?q=foobar".
   
-    1) "* <uid> FETCH (<what> {<size>}\r\n", using continuation syntax
-    2) <size> bytes of the actual message
-    3) ")\r\n", finishing the untagged response
-    4) "<tag> OK ...", finishing the command
+  curl would translate these into a legitimate HTTP request to servers,
+  although as was shown in bug #1206 it was not adjusted properly in the
+  cases where a HTTP proxy was used.
   
-  Part 1 is read in imap_fetch_resp(), part 2 is consumed in the PERFORM
-  phase by the transfer subsystem, parts 3 and 4 are currently ignored.

+- Multiple pipelines and limiting the number of connections.
   
-  Updated the coding style, in this function, to be consistant with other

+  Introducing a number of options to the multi interface that
+  allows for multiple pipelines to the same host, in order to

+  
+  Two new options for limiting the number of connections:

-- imap: Reversed the logic of the (un)successful tagged SELECT response
+Yang Tse (13 Mar 2013)
+- tool_main.c: remove redundant vms_show storage-class specifier
   
-  Reversed the logic of the unsuccessful vs successful tagged SELECT
-  response in imap_state_select_resp() to be more logical to read.
+  vms_show 'extern' storage-class specifier removed from tool_main.c due to...
+  
+  - Advice from Tor Arntsen: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-03/0164.html
+  
+  - HP OpenVMS docs stating that 'Extern is the default storage class for
+    variables declared outside a function.'

-  imap: Added processing of more than one response when sent in same packet
+  tool_main.c: fix VMS global variable storage-class specifier
   
-  Added a loop to imap_statemach_act() in which Curl_pp_readresp() is
-  called until the cache is drained. Without this multiple responses
-  received in a single packet could result in a hang or delay.
+  An extern submits a psect and a global reference to the linker to point
+  to it. Using "extern int vms_show = 0" also creates a globaldef.
+  
+  The use of the extern by itself does declare a psect but does not declare
+  a globalsymbol. It does declare a globalref. But the linker needs one and
+  only one globaldef or there is an error.

-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message: fix buffer overflow
-  
-  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
-  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
-  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.
-  
-  This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a
-  server that a libcurl based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or
-  IMAP. For applications that accept user provided URLs, it is also
-  thinkable that a malicious user would feed an application with a URL to

-  
-  build_curlbuild_h.com is a new file to generate the curlbuild.h file
-  that Curl is now using when it is using a curl_config.h file.
+  pingpong: Introduce Curl_pp_moredata()
   
-  post-config-vms.h is a new file that is needed to provide VMS specific
-  definitions, and most of them need to be set before the system header
-  files are included.
+  A simple function to test whether the PP is not sending and there are
+  still more data in its receiver cache. This will be later utilized to:
   
-  The VMS build procedure is fixed:
+  1) Change Curl_pp_multi_statemach() and Curl_pp_easy_statemach() to
+     not test socket state and just call user's statemach_act() function
+     when there are more data to process, because otherwise the task would
+     just hang, waiting for more data from the socket.
   
-     1. Fixed to link in the correct HP ssl library.
-     2. Fixed to detect if HP Kerberos is installed.
-     3. Fixed to detect if HP LDAP is installed.
-     4. Fixed to detect if gnv$libzshr is installed.
-     5. Simplified the input parameter parsing to not use a loop.
-     6. Warn that 64 bit pointer option support is not complete
-        in comments.
-     7. Default to IEEE floating if platform supports it so
-        resulting libcurl will be compatible with other
-        open source projects on VMS.
-     8. Default to LARGEFILE if platform supports it.
-     9. Default to enable SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, libz
-        if the libraries are present.
-     10. Build with exact case global symbols for libcurl.

-- xc-cc-check.m4: re-evaluate exporting and AC_SUBST'ing vars
-  
-  Notes:
+- pingpong: Optimised the endofresp() function
   
-  When running a configure script that has nested packages (for example
-  libcurl's configure with --enable-ares and c-ares sources embedded in
-  curl tree) and AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([nested-subdir]) machinery is used to
-  automatically run the nested configure script from within the parent
-  configure script, it happens that the nested _shell_ script will
-  inherit shell variables exported from the parent _shell_ script.
+  Reworked the pp->endofresp() function so that the conndata, line and
+  line length are passed down to it just as with Curl_client_write()
+  rather than each implementation of the function having to query
+  these values.
   
-  If for example parent configure script sets and exports LDFLAGS and LIBS
-  variables with proper values in order to link either a parent library or
-  program with a library which will be configured and built by a nested
-  package; It will happen that when the nested configure script runs, the
-  nested library does not exist yet and _any_ link-test done in the nested
-  configure will fail, such as those that autoconf macros perform in order
-  to detect existing compiler and its characteristics, the result is that
-  the nested configure script will fail with errors such as:
+  Additionally changed the int return type to bool as this is more
+  representative of the function's usage.

+Steve Holme (9 Feb 2013)
+- imap: Corrected some comments
+
+- smtp: Fixed an issue when processing EHLO failure responses
   
-  Fixes initial proxy response being processed by the tunneled protocol
-  handler instead of the HTTP wrapper handler. This issue would trigger
-  upon delayed CONNECT response from the proxy.
+  Fixed a small issue where smtp_endofresp() would look for capabilities
+  in the description part of a failure response. In theory a server
+  shouldn't respond with SIZE or AUTH in an EHLO command's failure
+  response but if it did then capabilities would be unnecessarily set
+  before eventually failing.
+

+  Renamed the authstate1 and authstate2 variables in imap_authenticate()

+  variable which was named due to a clash with the state() function.

+  Running tests\libtest\libntlmconnect.exe reveals a 1 byte (!) leak in

-  Up to automake 1.13.1 target's intermediate object files were placed

-  undocumented behavior, to achieve same behavior as if a per-target flag
-  had been specified when building targets that actually belong to

-  It seems automake 1.13.2 is going to break behavior mentioned above.
+  Snippet from curl_ntlm_msgs.c:
+     /* setup ntlm identity's domain and length */
+     dup_domain.tchar_ptr = malloc(sizeof(TCHAR) * (domlen + 1));
   
-  So, lets use a documented behavior in order to achieve same purpose,
-  across automake versions, no matter where automake wishes to place
-  intermediate object files.
+  (my domlen == 0).
   
-  Our build targets that already were using a per-target '_CFLAGS' or

-  This is a work-around for bug #1180 which is really libcurl's inability
-  to ignore SIGPIPE in a few cases. With this work-around at least curl
-  won't suffer from it!

-- Revert "configure: update req to 2.59"
+  VMS: fix and generate the VMS build config
   
-  This reverts commit 7a6d8b1b1a8fcc184c36d6b6e741e32250b4bacb.
+  config_h.com is a new file that generates a config.h file based on the
+  curl_config.h.in file and a quick scan of the configure script.  This is
+  actually a generic procedure that is shared with other VMS packages.

-- pop3: Added support for non-blocking SSL upgrade
+  The existing pre-built config-vms.h had over 100 entries that were not
+  correct and in some cases conflicted with the build options available in
+  the build_vms.com.
   
-  Added support for asynchronous SSL upgrade when using the
-  multi-interface.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (8 Jan 2013)
-- configure: update req to 2.59
+  generate_config_vms_h_curl.com is a helper procedure to the
+  config_h.com.  It covers the cases that the generic config_h.com is not
+  able to figure out, and accepts input from the build_vms.com procedure.
   
-  I ran the 2.59 version of autoupdate that updates obsoleted configure.ac
-  constructs to the 2.59 standard. With a little hands-on fiddling I
-  prevented it from ruining the quoting in AS_HELP_STRING() uses.
+  build_curlbuild_h.com is a new file to generate the curlbuild.h file
+  that Curl is now using when it is using a curl_config.h file.
   
-  I subsequently also bumped the required autoconf version to 2.59
-  (released in December 2003) as I don't have an older autoconf version
-  around to test with and I can't be bothered to install one either...
+  post-config-vms.h is a new file that is needed to provide VMS specific
+  definitions, and most of them need to be set before the system header
+  files are included.

-- imap.c: Small tidy up to add missing comment
+  The VMS build procedure is fixed:
+  
+     1. Fixed to link in the correct HP ssl library.
+     2. Fixed to detect if HP Kerberos is installed.
+     3. Fixed to detect if HP LDAP is installed.
+     4. Fixed to detect if gnv$libzshr is installed.
+     5. Simplified the input parameter parsing to not use a loop.
+     6. Warn that 64 bit pointer option support is not complete
+        in comments.
+     7. Default to IEEE floating if platform supports it so
+        resulting libcurl will be compatible with other
+        open source projects on VMS.
+     8. Default to LARGEFILE if platform supports it.
+     9. Default to enable SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, libz
+        if the libraries are present.
+     10. Build with exact case global symbols for libcurl.
+     11. Generate linker option file needed.
+     12. Compiler list option only commonly needed items.
+     13. fulllist option for those who really want it.
+     14. Create debug symbol file on Alpha, IA64.

+- schannel: Removed extended error connection setup flag
+  
+  According KB975858 this flag may cause problems on Windows 7 and
+  Windows Server 2008 R2 systems. Extended error information is not
+  currently used by libcurl and therefore not a requirement.
+  
+  The flag may improve the SSL-connection shutdown in case of an
+  error. This means it might be a good improvement in the future.
+

-- build: make use of 93 lib/*.c renamed files
-  
-  93 *.c source files renamed to use our standard naming scheme.
-  
-  This change affects 77 files in libcurl's source tree.
+  smtp_state_upgrade_tls() would attempt to incorrectly complete the
+  upgrade to smtps and start the EHLO command if

-- curl_setup.h: remove redundant include guard
+  pop3_state_upgrade_tls() would attempt to incorrectly complete the
+  upgrade to pop3s and start the CAPA command if

-- build and tests: curl_10char_object_name() shell function
-  
-  lib/objnames.inc provides definition of curl_10char_object_name() shell
-  function. The intended purpose of this function is to transliterate a
-  (*.c) source file name that may be longer than 10 characters, or not,
-  into a string with at most 10 characters which may be used as an OS/400
-  object name.
-  
-  Test case 1221 does unit testng of this function and also verifies
-  that it is possible to generate distinct short object names for all
-  curl and libcurl *.c source file names.
-  
-  lib/objnames-test.sh is the shell script used for test case 1221.
-  
-  tests/runtests.pl modified to accept shell script test cases.
+- imap.c: Fixed failure detection during TLS upgrade
   
-  More details inside lib/objnames.inc and lib/objnames-test.sh
+  imap_state_upgrade_tls() would attempt to incorrectly complete the

-- configure.ac: replace AM_CONFIG_HEADER with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS
-  
-  automake 1.13 errors if AM_CONFIG_HEADER is used in configure script.
-  automake 1.13 no longer autoupdates AM_CONFIG_HEADER to
-  AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, thing which automake has been doing since automake
-  version 1.7
-  
-  Given that our first automake supported version is automake 1.7,
-  simply replacing AM_CONFIG_HEADER usage with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS seems
-  enough to yet support same automake versions.
-  
-  Dave Reisner reported issue with 1.13 and provided patch.

-  Applied the POP3 fix from commit 2897ce7dc2e1 so smtp_dophase_done()
-  isn't called if smtp_multi_statemach() fails.
+  Some basic checks we make were placed early enough in generated
+  configure script when using autoconf 2.5X versions. Newer autoconf
+  versions expand these checks much further into the configure script,
+  rendering them useless. Using XC_CONFIGURE_PREAMBLE fixes placement
+  of early intended checks across all our autoconf supported versions.

+  When running a configure script that has nested packages (for example

+  curl tree) and AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([nested-subdir]) machinery is used to
+  automatically run the nested configure script from within the parent
+  configure script, it happens that the nested _shell_ script will
+  inherit shell variables exported from the parent _shell_ script.

+  Automake documents that doing this will make it choose a different name
+  for intermediate object files even when sharing source files across
+  targets of same Makefile.am.
+  
+  Up to automake 1.13.1 target's intermediate object files were placed
+  in the build subdirectory of the target. We depended on this, probably
+  undocumented behavior, to achieve same behavior as if a per-target flag
+  had been specified when building targets that actually belong to
+  different Makefile.am files.
+  
+  It seems automake 1.13.2 is going to break behavior mentioned above.
+  
+  So, lets use a documented behavior in order to achieve same purpose,
+  across automake versions, no matter where automake wishes to place
+  intermediate object files.
+  
+  Our build targets that already were using a per-target '_CFLAGS' or
+  '_CPPFLAGS' need no 'fixing', these were already 'fixed'. The only
+  Makefile.am or Makefile.in files in libcurl's source tree touched by
+  this 'fix' are tests/libtest/Makefile.inc and tests/unit/Makefile.inc.

+- Curl_resolver_getsock: fix the function description comment
   
-  Issue: When building a 32bit target with large file support HP-UX
-  <sys/socket.h> header file may simultaneously provide two different
-  sets of declarations for sendfile and sendpath functions, one with
-  static and another with external linkage. Given that we do not use
-  mentioned functions we really don't care which linkage is the
-  appropriate one, but on the other hand, the double declaration emmits
-  warnings when using the HP-UX compiler and errors when using modern
-  gcc versions resulting in fatal compilation errors.
+  It referred to it by the wrong name and said it returned the wrong value.
   
-  Mentioned issue is now fixed as long as we don't use sendfile nor

-- setup_once.h: HP-UX specific TRUE and FALSE definitions
+  This commit fixes a regression introduced in 052a08ff.
   
-  Some HP-UX system headers require TRUE defined to 1 and FALSE to 0.
+  NSS caches certs/keys returned by the SSL_GetClientAuthDataHook callback
+  and if we connect second time to the same server, the cached cert/key
+  pair is used.  If we use multiple client certificates for different
+  paths on the same server, we need to clear the session cache to force
+  NSS to call the hook again.  The commit 052a08ff prevented the session
+  cache from being cleared if a client certificate from file was used.
+  
+  The condition is now fixed to cover both cases: consssl->client_nickname
+  is not NULL if a client certificate from the NSS database is used and
+  connssl->obj_clicert is not NULL if a client certificate from file is
+  used.

+- curl: ignore SIGPIPE - compilation fix
 
-  configure: fix cross pkg-config detection
+- build: fix circular header inclusion with other packages
   
-  When cross-compiling, CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG was checking for the cross
-  pkg-config using ${host}-pkg-config.
+  This commit renames lib/setup.h to lib/curl_setup.h and
+  renames lib/setup_once.h to lib/curl_setup_once.h.
   
-  The gold standard for doing this correctly is pkg-config's own macro,
-  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG.  However, on the assumption that you have a good
-  reason not to use that directly (reduced dependencies for maintainer
-  builds?), the behaviour of cURL's version should at least match.
-  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG uses AC_PATH_TOOL, which ultimately ends up trying
-  ${host_alias}-pkg-config; this is not quite the same as what cURL does,
-  and may differ because ${host} has been run through config.sub.  For
-  instance, when cross-building to the armhf architecture on Ubuntu,
-  ${host_alias} is arm-linux-gnueabihf while ${host} is
-  arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.  This may also have been the cause of the
-  problem reported at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0224.html.
+  Removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard foreign
+  to libcurl. [1]
   
-  AC_PATH_TOOL is significantly simpler than cURL's current code, and
-  dates back to well before the current minimum of Autoconf 2.57, so let's
-  use it instead.
+  Removes the need and presence of an alarming notice we carried
+  in old setup_once.h [2]
+  
+  ----------------------------------------
+  
+  1 - lib/setup_once.h used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro as header inclusion guard
+      up to commit ec691ca3 which changed this to HEADER_CURL_SETUP_ONCE_H,
+      this single inclusion guard is enough to ensure that inclusion of
+      lib/setup_once.h done from lib/setup.h is only done once.
+  
+      Additionally lib/setup.h has always used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro to
+      protect inclusion of setup_once.h even after commit ec691ca3, this
+      was to avoid a circular header inclusion triggered when building a
+      c-ares enabled version with c-ares sources available which also has
+      a setup_once.h header. Commit ec691ca3 exposes the real nature of
+      __SETUP_ONCE_H usage in lib/setup.h, it is a header inclusion guard
+      foreign to libcurl belonging to c-ares's setup_once.h
+  
+      The renaming this commit does, fixes the circular header inclusion,
+      and as such removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard
+      foreign to libcurl. Macro __SETUP_ONCE_H no longer used in libcurl.
+  
+  2 - Due to the circular interdependency of old lib/setup_once.h and the
+      c-ares setup_once.h header, old file lib/setup_once.h has carried
+      back from 2006 up to now days an alarming and prominent notice about
+      the need of keeping libcurl's and c-ares's setup_once.h in sync.
+  
+      Given that this commit fixes the circular interdependency, the need
+      and presence of mentioned notice is removed.
+  
+      All mentioned interdependencies come back from now old days when
+      the c-ares project lived inside a curl subdirectory. This commit
+      removes last traces of such fact.

+Daniel Stenberg (8 Jan 2013)

-  A bundle is a list of all persistent connections to the same host.
-  The connection cache consists of a hash of bundles, with the
-  hostname as the key.
-  The benefits may not be obvious, but they are two:
+  This reverts commit 7a6d8b1b1a8fcc184c36d6b6e741e32250b4bacb.
   
-  1) Faster search for connections to reuse, since the hash

-  This has been tested in a live system for a few weeks, and of
-  course passes the test suite.
+  I subsequently also bumped the required autoconf version to 2.59
+  (released in December 2003) as I don't have an older autoconf version

-  Although it is not explicitly stated in the documentation, NSS uses
-  *pRetCert and *pRetKey even if the client authentication hook returns
-  a failure.  Namely, if we destroy *pRetCert without clearing *pRetCert
-  afterwards, NSS destroys the certificate once again, which causes a

-  preprocessor macros. Usage of these literals in libcurl's external
-  API was introduced in commit de24d7bd4c causing AIX build failures.
-  Appropriate inclusion of sys/poll.h by libcurl's external interface

-  Test 92 and 194: normalize spaces in the Server headers
+  Given that our first automake supported version is automake 1.7,
+  simply replacing AM_CONFIG_HEADER usage with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS seems
+  enough to yet support same automake versions.
   
-  It makes no difference from curl's point of view but

-  Do not mix CRLF and LF header endings in a couple of HTTP tests
-  
-  Consistently use CRLF instead. The mixed endings weren't
-  documented so I assume they were unintentional.
-  
-  This change doesn't matter for curl itself but makes using
-  the tests with a proxy between curl and the test server
-  more convenient.
+- pop3_doing: Applied debug info message when function fails
   
-  Tests that consistently use no carriage returns were
-  left unmodified as one can easily work around this.
+  Applied the same debug message as used in smtp_doing() and imap_doing()
+  when pop3_multi_statemach() fails.
 
-- fixed memory leak: CURLOPT_RESOLVE with multi interface

-- mem-include-scan: verify memory #includes
-  
-  If we use memory functions (malloc, free, strdup etc) in C sources in
-  libcurl and we fail to include curl_memory.h or memdebug.h we either
-  fail to properly support user-provided memory callbacks or the memory
-  leak system of the test suite fails.
-  
-  After Ajit's report of a failure in the first category in http_proxy.c,
-  I spotted a few in the second category as well. These problems are now
-  tested for by test 1132 which runs a perl program that scans for and
-  attempts to check that we use the correct include files if a memory
-  related function is used in the source code.

-  Based on an earlier patch by Marcin Adamski.
+  Fixed a problem with the state machine when attempting to log in with

+  would not read the response due to inappropriate IMAP_STOP states being
+  set after the login was sent.
 
-- autoconf: don't force-disable compiler debug option
-  
-  When nothing is told to configure, we should not enforce switching off
-  debug options with -g0 (or similar). We instead don't use -g at all in

-  dictate what to do.

-  Digst: Add microseconds into nounce calculation
-  
-  When using only 1 second precision, curl doesn't create new cnonce
-  values quickly enough for all uses.
-  
-  For example, issuing the following command multiple times to a recent
-  Tomcat causes authentication failures:
-  
-  curl --digest -utest:test http://tomcat.test.com:8080/manager/list
-  
-  This is because curl uses the same cnonce for several seconds, but
-  doesn't increment the nonce counter. Â Tomcat correctly interprets
-  this as a replay attack and rejects the request.
-  
-  When microsecond-precision is available, this commit causes curl to
-  change cnonce values much more frequently.
+Yang Tse (28 Dec 2012)
+- build: rename 76 lib/*.h files
   
-  With microsecond resolution, increasing the nounce length used in the

-  axTLS:
-  
-  This will make the axTLS backend perform the RFC2818 checks, honoring
-  the VERIFYHOST setting similar to the OpenSSL backend.
-  
-  Generic for OpenSSL and axTLS:
-  
-  Move the hostcheck and cert_hostcheck functions from the lib/ssluse.c
-  files to make them genericly available for both the OpenSSL, axTLS and
-  other SSL backends. They are now in the new lib/hostcheck.c file.
-  
-  CyaSSL:
-  
-  CyaSSL now also has the RFC2818 checks enabled by default. There is a
-  limitation that the verifyhost can not be enabled exclusively on the
-  Subject CN field comparison. This SSL backend will thus behave like the
-  NSS and the GnuTLS (meaning: RFC2818 ok, or bust). In other words:
-  setting verifyhost to 0 or 1 will disable the Subject Alt Names checks
-  too.
-  
-  Schannel:
-  
-  Updated the schannel information messages: Split the IP address usage
-  message from the verifyhost setting and changed the message about
-  disabling SNI (Server Name Indication, used in HTTP virtual hosting)
-  into a message stating that the Subject Alternative Names checks are
-  being disabled when verifyhost is set to 0 or 1. As a side effect of
-  switching off the RFC2818 related servername checks with
-  SCH_CRED_NO_SERVERNAME_CHECK
-  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa923430.aspx) the SNI feature
-  is being disabled. This effect is not documented in MSDN, but Wireshark
-  output clearly shows the effect (details on the libcurl maillist).
-  
-  PolarSSL:
-  
-  Fix the prototype change in PolarSSL of ssl_set_session() and the move
-  of the peer_cert from the ssl_context to the ssl_session. Found this
-  change in the PolarSSL SVN between r1316 and r1317 where the
-  POLARSSL_VERSION_NUMBER was at 0x01010100. But to accommodate the Ubuntu
-  PolarSSL version 1.1.4 the check is to discriminate between lower then
-  PolarSSL version 1.2.0 and 1.2.0 and higher. Note: The PolarSSL SVN
-  trunk jumped from version 1.1.1 to 1.2.0.
+- build: make use of 76 lib/*.h renamed files
   
-  Generic:
+  76 private header files renamed to use our standard naming scheme.
   
-  All the SSL backends are fixed and checked to work with the
-  ssl.verifyhost as a boolean, which is an internal API change.
+  This change affects 322 files in libcurl's source tree.

+- socklift.c: Quick fix to re-add missing code
 
-- CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST: stop supporting the 1 value
-  
-  After a research team wrote a document[1] that found several live source
-  codes out there in the wild that misused the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
-  option thinking it was a boolean, this change now bans 1 as a value and
-  will make libcurl return error for it.
-  
-  1 was never a sensible value to use in production but was introduced
-  back in the days to help debugging. It was always documented clearly
-  this way.
-  
-  1 was never supported by all SSL backends in libcurl, so this cleanup
-  makes the treatment of it unified.
-  
-  The report's list of mistakes for this option were all PHP code and
-  while there's a binding layer between libcurl and PHP, the PHP team has
-  decided that they have an as thin layer as possible on top of libcurl so
-  they will not alter or specifically filter a 'TRUE' value for this
-  particular option. I sympathize with that position.

-  curl_multi_wait: Add parameter to return number of active sockets
+  runtests and friends: Do not add undefined values to @INC
   
-  Minor change to recently introduced function.  BC breaking, but since
-  curl_multi_wait() doesn't exist in any releases that should be fine.
+  On FreeBSD this fixes the warning:
+  Use of uninitialized value $p in string eq at /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.14.2/BSDPAN/BSDPAN.pm line 36.

 This function was added in libcurl 7.18.0. Before this version, there was no
 explicit support for pausing transfers.
+.SH "USAGE WITH THE MULTI-SOCKET INTERFACE"
+Before libcurl 7.32.0, when a specific handle was unpaused with this function,
+there was no particular forced rechecking or similar of the socket's state,
+which made the continuation of the transfer get delayed until next
+multi-socket call invoke or even longer. Alternatively, the user could
+forcibly call for example curl_multi_socket_all(3) - with a rather hefty
+performance penalty.
+
+Starting in libcurl 7.32.0, unpausing a transfer will schedule a timeout
+trigger for that handle 1 millisecond into the future, so that a
+curl_multi_socket_action( ... CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT) can be used immediately
+afterwards to get the transfer going again as desired.
 .SH "MEMORY USE"
 When pausing a read by returning the magic return code from a write callback,
 the read data is already in libcurl's internal buffers so it'll have to keep
 it in an allocated buffer until the reading is again unpaused using this
 function.

+
+This function gets called by libcurl instead of its internal equivalent with a

+can slow down to about one call per second.
+
+\fIclientp\fP is the pointer set with \fICURLOPT_XFERINFODATA\fP, it is only
+passed along from the application to the callback.
+
+The callback gets told how much data libcurl will transfer and has
+transferred, in number of bytes. \fIdltotal\fP is the total number of bytes
+libcurl expects to download in this transfer. \fIdlnow\fP is the number of
+bytes downloaded so far. \fIultotal\fP is the total number of bytes libcurl
+expects to upload in this transfer. \fIulnow\fP is the number of bytes
+uploaded so far.
+
+Unknown/unused argument values passed to the callback will be set to zero
+(like if you only download data, the upload size will remain 0). Many times
+the callback will be called one or more times first, before it knows the data
+sizes so a program must be made to handle that.

 <p class="level1">Pass a pointer to a function that matches the following prototype: <span class="bold">size_t function( void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userdata);</span>. This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received header data. The header callback will be called once for each header and only complete header lines are passed on to the callback. Parsing headers is very easy using this. The size of the data pointed to by <span Class="emphasis">ptr</span> is <span Class="emphasis">size</span> multiplied with <span Class="emphasis">nmemb</span>. Do not assume that the header line is zero terminated! The pointer named <span Class="emphasis">userdata</span> is the one you set with the <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTWRITEHEADER">CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER</a> option.

 <p class="level1">A complete HTTP header that is passed to this function can be up to <span Class="emphasis">CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER</span> (100K) bytes.

That is, it will be the function specified with <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTWRITEFUNCTION">CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</a>, or if it is not specified or NULL - the default, stream-writing function. 
 <p class="level1">It's important to note that the callback will be invoked for the headers of all responses received after initiating a request and not just the final response. This includes all responses which occur during authentication negotiation. If you need to operate on only the headers from the final response, you will need to collect headers in the callback yourself and use HTTP status lines, for example, to delimit response boundaries. 
 <p class="level1">When a server sends a chunked encoded transfer, it may contain a trailer. That trailer is identical to a HTTP header and if such a trailer is received it is passed to the application using this callback as well. There are several ways to detect it being a trailer and not an ordinary header: 1) it comes after the response-body. 2) it comes after the final header line (CR LF) 3) a Trailer: header among the regular response-headers mention what header(s) to expect in the trailer.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Adds a standard easy handle to the multi stack. This function call will make
-this \fImulti_handle\fP control the specified \fIeasy_handle\fP.
-Furthermore, libcurl now initiates the connection associated with the
-specified \fIeasy_handle\fP.
+this \fImulti_handle\fP control the specified \fIeasy_handle\fP.  Furthermore,
+libcurl now initiates the connection associated with the specified
+\fIeasy_handle\fP.
 
 When an easy handle has been added to a multi stack, you can not and you must
 not use \fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP on that handle!
 
 If the easy handle is not set to use a shared (CURLOPT_SHARE) or global DNS
 cache (CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE), it will be made to use the DNS cache
 that is shared between all easy handles within the multi handle when
 \fIcurl_multi_add_handle(3)\fP is called.
 
+If you have CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION set in the multi handle (and you really
+should if you're working event-based with \fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP
+and friends), that callback will be called from within this function to ask
+for an updated timer so that your main event loop will get the activity on
+this handle to get started.
+
 The easy handle will remain added until you remove it again with
 \fIcurl_multi_remove_handle(3)\fP. You should remove the easy handle from the
 multi stack before you terminate first the easy handle and then the multi
 handle:
 
 1 - \fIcurl_multi_remove_handle(3)\fP

  Currently the SSH based code uses it a bit, but to remove PATH_MAX from there
  we need libssh2 to properly tell us when we pass in a too small buffer and
  its current API (as of libssh2 1.2.7) doesn't.
 
-1.6 progress callback without doubles
-
- The progress callback was introduced way back in the days and the choice to
- use doubles in the arguments was possibly good at the time. Today the doubles
- only confuse users and make the amounts less precise. We should introduce
- another progress callback option that take precedence over the old one and
- have both co-exist for a forseeable time until we can remove the double-using
- one.

-1.7 Happy Eyeball dual stack connect
+1.6 Happy Eyeball dual stack connect
 
  In order to make alternative technologies not suffer when transitioning, like
  when introducing IPv6 as an alternative to IPv4 and there are more than one
  option existing simultaneously there are reasons to reconsider internal
  choices.
 
  To make libcurl do blazing fast IPv6 in a dual-stack configuration, this needs
  to be addressed:
 
     http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555
 
+1.7 Modified buffer size approach
+
+ Current libcurl allocates a fixed 16K size buffer for download and an
+ additional 16K for upload. They are always unconditionally part of the easy
+ handle. If CRLF translations are requested, an additional 32K "scratch
+ buffer" is allocated. A total of 64K transfer buffers in the worst case.
+
+ First, while the handles are not actually in use these buffers could be freed
+ so that lingering handles just kept in queues or whatever waste less memory.
+
+ Secondly, SFTP is a protocol that needs to handle many ~30K blocks at once
+ since each need to be individually acked and therefore libssh2 must be
+ allowed to send (or receive) many separate ones in parallel to achieve high
+ transfer speeds. A current libcurl build with a 16K buffer makes that
+ impossible, but one with a 512K buffer will reach MUCH faster transfers. But
+ allocating 512K unconditionally for all buffers just in case they would like
+ to do fast SFTP transfers at some point is not a good solution either.
+
+ Dynamically allocate buffer size depending on protocol in use in combination
+ with freeing it after each individual transfer? Other suggestions?
+
+

  EWOULDBLOCK or similar. Blocking cases include:

 types are also forbidden. Libcurl uses enums as vararg procedure tagfields...
 Happily, there is a pragma forcing enums to type "int". The original libcurl
 header files are thus altered during build process to use this pragma, in
 order to force libcurl enums of being type int (the pragma disposition in use
 before inclusion is restored before resuming the including unit compilation).
 
-  Three SSL implementations were present in libcurl. Nevertheless, none of them
-is available on OS/400. To support SSL on OS/400, a fourth implementation has
-been added (qssl.[ch]). There is no way to have different certificate stores
-for CAs and for personal/application certificates/key. More, the SSL context
-may be defined as an application identifier in the main certificate store,
-or as a keyring file. As a consequence, the meaning of some fields have been
-slightly altered:
-_ The "certificate identifier" is taken from CURLOPT_SSLCERT if defined, else
-from CURLOPT_CAINFO.
-_ The certificate identifier is then used as an application identifier in the
-main certificate store. If successful, this context is used.
-_ If the previous step failed, the certificate identifier is used as the file
-name of a keyring. CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD is used here as the keyring password.
-_ The default ca-bundle (CURLOPT_CAINFO) is set to the main certificate store's
-keyring file name: this allows to use the system global CAs by default. (In that
-case, the keyring password is safely recovered from the system... IBM dixit!)
+  Two SSL implementations are available to libcurl on OS/400: QsoSSL which is
+obsolescent, does not support asynchronous I/O and only allows a single SSL
+context within a job, and GSKit that does not suffer from these limitations
+and is able to provide some information about the server certificate.
+  Both implementations of SSL are working on "certificate stores" or keyrings,
+rather than individual certificate/key files. Certificate stores, as weel as
+"certificate labels" are managed by external IBM-defined applications.
+  There are two ways to specify an SSL context:
+- By an application identifier.
+- By a keyring file pathname and (optionally) certificate label.
+  To identify an SSL context by application identifier, use option
+SETOPT_SSLCERT to specify the application identifier.
+  To address an SSL context by keyring and certificate label, use CURLOPT_CAINFO
+to set-up the keyring pathname, CURLOPT_SSLCERT to define the certificate label
+(omitting it will cause the default certificate in keyring to be used) and
+CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD to give the keyring password. If SSL is used without
+defining any of these options, the default (i.e.: system) keyring is used for
+server certificate validation.
 
   Non-standard EBCDIC wrapper prototypes are defined in an additional header
 file: ccsidcurl.h. These should be self-explanatory to an OS/400-aware
 designer. CCSID 0 can be used to select the current job's CCSID.

 How to Build:
 
-The (brute-force) builder is [.packages.vms]build_vms.com.  Comments in
-this procedure describe various optional parameters which enable or
-disable optional program features, or which control the build in other
-ways.  Product files (.EXE, .H, .LIS, .MAP, .OBJ, .OLB, ...) should be
-produced in an architecture-specific subdirectory under this directory
-([.ALPHA], [.IA64], [.VAX]).
+The GNV based build and the DCL based build procedures are not compatible
+and you must make sure that none of the build files are present before
+running a different type of build.  Use the "REALCLEAN" option for
+BUILD_VMS.COM and the "REALCLEAN" option for clean_gnv_curl.com.
+
+The (brute-force) DCL based builder is [.packages.vms]build_vms.com.
+Comments in this procedure describe various optional parameters which
+enable or disable optional program features, or which control the build
+in other ways.  Product files (.EXE, .H, .LIS, .MAP, .OBJ, .OLB, ...)
+should be produced in an architecture-specific subdirectory under this
+directory ([.ALPHA], [.IA64], [.VAX]).
+
+The file curl_gnv_build_steps.txt contains information on buildling using
+the GNV tool kit, building a shared libcurl, and producting a PCSI kit for
+distribution.  The curl_gnv_build_steps.text is included in the release
+notes file of the PCSI kit.
+
+The building with 64 bit pointers does not currently work.
+
+The build procedure will detect if HP OpenSSL, LDAP, and Kerberos are
+installed and default to building with them.
+
+The build procedure will also detect if a compatible ZLIB shared image
+is installed from a PCSI kit and default to using it.
 
    Example build commands:
 
       @ [.packages.vms]build_vms.com CLEAN
       @ [.packages.vms]build_vms.com LARGE LDAP
       submit /noprint [.packages.vms]build_vms.com /param = (LARGE, LDAP)
 
+The build_vms.com procedure does not build the shared image file or the PCSI
+kit.  If you have built a curl with ZLIB and HPSSL support as well as if
+LDAP and Kerberos installed, you can use the GNV_LINK_CURL.COM file.
+
+The GNV_LINK_CURL.COM contains information on how to link and run with a newer
+version of HP SSL than what may be install on an Alpha or IA64 based system.
+
+To build the PCSI kit, follow the the instructions in the file
+curl_gnv_build_steps.txt.
 
 Other Notes:
 
+This release fixes known bugs #22, and #57 in the [curl.docs]known_bugs.
+file.
+
+The libcurl formdata.c module and Curl tools post form now have some
+understanding of VMS file types.  Files will be posted in STREAM_LF format.
+
+The Curl tool now has some understanding of VMS file types and will upload the
+files in STREAM_LF fomat.
+
+When CURL is uploading a VARIABLE format VMS file, it is less efficient as in
+order to get the file size, it will first read the entire file once, and then
+read the file again for the actual upload.
+
+The Curl tool will now always download files into STREAM_LF format.  Even if a
+file by that name with a different format already exists.  This is needed to
+allow interrupted downloads to be continued.
+
+
+The libcurl file module still does not understand VMS file types and requires
+the input files to be in STREAM_LF to work propery.
+
 The test suites are not supported as of 7.11.0.
 
 The curlmsg.sdl and curlmsg.h files are generated from curlmsg.msg.
 This is not done automatically, since the .MSG file is a hand edit
 of the relevant stuff from the curl.h file.  If you want to do this
 yourself you'll need the SDL package from the freeware collection.
