 <p class="level1">2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On Unix-like systems, it will simply try to load .curlrc from the determined home dir.

 <p class="level0"><a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt</a> is used to tell libcurl how to behave. By setting the appropriate options, the application can change libcurl's behavior.  All options are set with an <span Class="emphasis">option</span> followed by a <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span>. That parameter can be a <span Class="bold">long</span>, a <span Class="bold">function pointer</span>, an <span class="bold">object pointer</span> or a <span Class="bold">curl_off_t</span>, depending on what the specific option expects. Read this manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl to behave badly!  You can only set one option in each function call. A typical application uses many <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt</a> calls in the setup phase. 
 <p class="level0">Options set with this function call are valid for all forthcoming transfers performed using this <span Class="emphasis">handle</span>.  The options are not in any way reset between transfers, so if you want subsequent transfers with different options, you must change them between the transfers. You can optionally reset all options back to internal default with <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_reset.html">curl_easy_reset</a>. 
 <p class="level0">Strings passed to libcurl as 'char *' arguments, are copied by the library; thus the string storage associated to the pointer argument may be overwritten after <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt</a> returns. The only exception to this rule is really <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)</span>, but the alternative that copies the string <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS(3)</span> has some usage characteristics you need to read up on. 
 <p class="level0">Before version 7.17.0, strings were not copied. Instead the user was forced keep them available until libcurl no longer needed them. 
 <p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">handle</span> is the return code from a <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_init.html">curl_easy_init</a> or <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_duphandle.html">curl_easy_duphandle</a> call. <a name="BEHAVIOR"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">BEHAVIOR OPTIONS</h2>

Only use one handle in one thread at any time. You can pass the handles around among threads, but you must never use a single handle from more than one thread at any given time.

 <p class="level0">If you are accessing HTTPS or FTPS URLs in a multi-threaded manner, you are then of course using the underlying SSL library multi-threaded and those libs might have their own requirements on this issue. Basically, you need to provide one or two functions to allow it to function properly. For all details, see this:

 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HEADEROPT, long bitmask);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a long that is a bitmask of options of how to deal with headers. The two
 mutually exclusive options are:
 
-\fBCURLHEADER_UNIFIED\fP - keep working as before. This means
-\fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP headers will be used in requests both to servers
-and proxies. With this option enabled, \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)\fP will not
-have any effect.
+\fBCURLHEADER_UNIFIED\fP - the headers specified in
+\fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP will be used in requests both to servers and
+proxies. With this option enabled, \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)\fP will not have
+any effect.
 
 \fBCURLHEADER_SEPARATE\fP - makes \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP headers only get
 sent to a server and not to a proxy. Proxy headers must be set with
 \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)\fP to get used. Note that if a non-CONNECT request
 is sent to a proxy, libcurl will send both server headers and proxy
 headers. When doing CONNECT, libcurl will send \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)\fP
 headers only to the proxy and then \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP headers only to
 the server.

A parameter with bit 0 set (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_301</span>) tells the library to respect <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. Setting bit 1 (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_302</span>) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a 302 redirect whilst setting bit 2 (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_303</span>) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a 303 redirect. The value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_ALL</span> is a convenience define that sets all three bits.

 <p class="level0">When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity.  Curl verifies whether the certificate is authentic, i.e. that you can trust that the server is who the certificate says it is. This trust is based on a chain of digital signatures, rooted in certification authority (CA) certificates you supply.  curl uses a default bundle of CA certificates (the path for that is determined at build time) and you can specify alternate certificates with the <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_CAINFO.html">CURLOPT_CAINFO</a> option or the <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_CAPATH.html">CURLOPT_CAPATH</a> option.
