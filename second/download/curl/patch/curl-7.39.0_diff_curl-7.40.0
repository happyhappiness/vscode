-Version 7.39.0 (5 Nov 2014)
+Version 7.40.0 (7 Jan 2015)
 
-Daniel Stenberg (5 Nov 2014)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: 7.39.0 release (commit b3875606925)
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Jan 2015)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: version 7.40.0
 
-- curl_easy_duphandle: CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS read out of bounds
-  
-  When duplicating a handle, the data to post was duplicated using
-  strdup() when it could be binary and contain zeroes and it was not even
-  zero terminated! This caused read out of bounds crashes/segfaults.
+- darwinssl: fix session ID keys to only reuse identical sessions
   
-  Since the lib/strdup.c file no longer is easily shared with the curl
-  tool with this change, it now uses its own version instead.
+  ...to avoid a session ID getting cached without certificate checking and
+  then after a subsequent _enabling_ of the check libcurl could still
+  re-use the session done without cert checks.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20141105.html
-  CVE: CVE-2014-3707
-  Reported-By: Symeon Paraschoudis
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108A.html
+  Reported-by: Marc Hesse
 
-- lib544.c: use duphandle for test 545
+- tests: make sure CRLFs can't be used in URLs passed to proxy
   
-  To verify that curl_easy_duphandle() works fine on a handle that has
-  gotten data stored with *_COPYPOSTFIELDS.
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108B.html
 
-- tests: add new feature 'SSLpinning'
+- url-parsing: reject CRLFs within URLs
   
-  ... and make test 2034 and 2035 require it, and have it set when built
-  with OpenSSL or GnuTLS.
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108B.html

-- buildconf: update copyright year
+Steve Holme (7 Jan 2015)
+- ldap: Convert attribute output to UTF-8 when Unicode
 
-Steve Holme (4 Nov 2014)
-- INSTALL: Consistent spacing in section headings, paragraphs and examples
+- ldap: Convert DN output to UTF-8 when Unicode
 
-Daniel Stenberg (4 Nov 2014)
-- buildconf: stop checking for libtool
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Jan 2015)
+- hostip: remove 'stale' argument from Curl_fetch_addr proto
   
-  As we only use libtoolize, only check for that!
+  Also, remove the log output of the resolved name is NOT in the cache in
+  the spirit of only telling when something is actually happening.
 
-Steve Holme (4 Nov 2014)

+  
+  Reported-by: Michael Osipov
 
-- README: Corrected inconsistent use of --help
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Jan 2015)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: updated with ./contributors.sh output
 
-- INSTALL: Use GSS-API rather than GSSAPI
-  
-  As implementations are refereed to GSS-API libraries as per the RFC and
-  GSSAPI typically refers to the SASL authentication mechanism.
+Dan Fandrich (5 Jan 2015)
+- curl_multibyte.h: Eliminated some trailing whitespace
+
+Steve Holme (4 Jan 2015)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with ea93252ef1
+
+- ldap: Fixed Unicode usage for all Win32 builds
   
-  ...and minor rewording on the same paragraph.
+  Otherwise, the fixes in the previous commits would only be applicable
+  to IDN and SSPI based builds and not others such as OpenSSL with LDAP
+  enabled.
 
-- README: Added note about using Visual Studio projects out of git repository

+- ldap: Fix memory leak from commit 3a805c5cc1
 
-  cmake: fix ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS use
+- ldap: Fixed attribute variable warnings when Unicode is enabled
   
-  CMake 2.8's FindZLIB.cmake documents ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS, see
-  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.0/cmake.html#module:FindZLIB
+  Use 'TCHAR *' for local attribute variable rather than 'char *'.
+
+- ldap: Fixed DN variable warnings when Unicode is enabled
   
-  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/123
+  Use 'TCHAR *' for local DN variable rather than 'char *'.
 
-- [Jay Satiro brought this change]
+- ldap: Remove the unescape_elements() function
+  
+  Due to the recent modifications this function is no longer used.
 
-  SSL: PolarSSL default min SSL version TLS 1.0
+- ldap.c: Fixed compilation warning
   
-  - Prior to this change no SSL minimum version was set by default at
-  runtime for PolarSSL. Therefore in most cases PolarSSL would probably
-  have defaulted to a minimum version of SSLv3 which is no longer secure.
+  ldap.c:98: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive
 
-- opts-Makefile: put more man pages into dist and make hmtl+pdf
+- ldap: Fixed support for Unicode filter in Win32 search call
 
-- curl_multi_setopt.3: refer to stand-alone pages
+- ldap.c: Fixed compilation warning
   
-  ... instead of duplicating info.
+  ldap.c:802: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer
+              expressions
 
-- opts: more multi options as stand-alone man pages
+- ldap: Fixed support for Unicode attributes in Win32 search call
 
-- Makefile.am: two cmake files are gone
+- ldap: Fixed memory leak from commit efb64fdf80
   
-  8cb010144 removed the CurlCheckCSourceCompiles.cmake and
-  CurlCheckCSourceRuns.cmake files
-
-- opts: made stand-alone man-pages for several multi options
+  The unescapped DN was not freed after a successful character conversion.
 
-- [Carlo Wood brought this change]
+- ldap.c: Fixed compilation error
+  
+  ldap.c:738: error: macro "LDAP_TRACE" passed 2 arguments, but takes
+              just 1
 
-  Curl_single_getsock: fix hold/pause sock handling
+- ldap.c: Fixed compilation warning
   
-  The previous condition that checked if the socket was marked as readable
-  when also adding a writable one, was incorrect and didn't take the pause
-  bits properly into account.
+  ldap.c:89: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive
 
-- [Peter Wu brought this change]
+- ldap: Fixed support for Unicode DN in Win32 search call
 
-  cmake: fix struct sockaddr_storage check
-  
-  CHECK_TYPE_SIZE_PREINCLUDE is an internal, undocumented variable which
-  was removed in cmake 2.8.1. According to the MSDN docs[1], inclusion
-  of winsock2.h is sufficient. WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN does not really seem
-  to affect the tests, so remove it too[2].
-  
-  For the non-windows case, remove inet headers as POSIX only requires
-  sys/socket.h.
+- ldap: Fixed Unicode user and password in Win32 bind calls
+
+- ldap: Fixed Unicode host name in Win32 initialisation calls
+
+- ldap: Use host.dispname for infof() connection failure messages
   
-   [1]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740504%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
-   [2]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11040133/what-does-defining-win32-lean-and-mean-exclude-exactly
+  As host.name may be encoded use dispname for infof() failure messages.
+
+- ldap: Prefer 'CURLcode result' for curl result codes
+
+- ldap: Pass write length in all Curl_client_write() calls
   
-  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
+  As we get the length for the DN and attribute variables, and we know
+  the length for the line terminator, pass the length values rather than
+  zero as this will save Curl_client_write() from having to perform an
+  additional strlen() call.
 
-- [Peter Wu brought this change]
+- ldap: Fixed attribute memory leaks on failed client write
+  
+  Fixed memory leaks from commit 086ad79970 as was noted in the commit
+  comments.
 
-  cmake: clean OtherTests, fixing -Werror
+- ldap: Fixed DN memory leaks on failed client write
   
-  There were several -Wunused warnings and one duplicate macro definition.
-  The EXTRA_DEFINES variable of the CurlCheckCSources macro was being
-  abused ("__unused1\n#undef inline\n#define __unused2", seriously?) to
-  insert extra C code. Avoid this broken abstraction and use cmake's
-  check_c_source_compiles directly (works fine with CMake 2.8, maybe
-  even cmake 2.6).
+  Fixed memory leaks from commit 086ad79970 as was noted in the commit
+  comments.
+
+- curl_ntlm_core.c: Fixed compilation warning from commit 1cb17b2a5d
   
-  After cleaning up all related variables (EXTRA_DEFINES,
-  HEADER_INCLUDES, auxiliary headers_hack), also remove a duplicate
-  add_headers_include macro and remove duplicate header additions before
-  the struct timeval check.
+  curl_ntlm_core.c:146: warning: passing 'DES_cblock' (aka 'unsigned char
+                        [8]') to parameter of type 'char *' converts
+                        between pointers to integer types with different
+                        sign
+
+- ntlm: Use extend_key_56_to_64() for all cryptography engines
   
-  Oh, and now the code is converted to use CheckCSourceRuns and
-  CheckCSourceCompiles, the two curl-specific helpers can be removed.
-  Unfortunately, the cmake output is now slightly more verbose. Before:
+  Rather than duplicate the code in setup_des_key() for OpenSSL and in
+  extend_key_56_to_64() for non-OpenSSL based crypto engines, as it is
+  the same, use extend_key_56_to_64() for all engines.
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with 34f0bd110f
+
+- curl_ntlm_core.c: Fixed compilation warning
   
-      Performing Test int send(int, const void *, size_t, int) (curl_cv_func_send_test)
-      Performing Test int send(int, const void *, size_t, int) (curl_cv_func_send_test) - Failed
+  curl_ntlm_core.c:458: warning: 'ascii_uppercase_to_unicode_le' defined
+                        but not used
+
+- endian: Fixed bit-shift in 64-bit integer read functions
   
-  Since check_c_source_compiles prints the varname, now you see:
+  From commit 43792592ca and 4bb5a351b2.
   
-      Performing Test curl_cv_func_send_test

+- endian: Added 64-bit integer read function
+
+- COPYING: Bumped copyright year to 2015
+
+- version: Bump copyright year to 2015

+- smb.c: Fixed compilation warnings
   
-  Compared cmake output with each other using vimdiff, no functional
-  differences were found. Tested with GCC 4.9.1 and Clang 3.5.0.
+  smb.c:780: warning: passing 'char *' to parameter of type 'unsigned

+- endian: Fixed Linux compilation issues
   
-  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
+  Having files named endian.[c|h] seemed to cause issues under Linux so
+  renamed them both to have the curl_ prefix in the filenames.

+- [Julien Nabet brought this change]
 
-  cmake: fix gethostby{addr,name}_r in CurlTests
+  lib1900.c: Fixed cppcheck error
   
-  This patch cleans up the automatically-generated (?) code and fixes one
-  case that will always fail due to syntax error.
+  lib1900.c:182: (style) Array index 'handlenum' is used before limits
+                 check
   
-  HAVE_GETHOSTBYADDR_R_5_REENTRANT always failed because of a trailing
-  character ("int length;q"). Several parameter type and unused variable
-  warnings popped up. This causes a detection failure with -Werror.
+  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/133
+
+- endian: Added standard function descriptions
+
+- endian: Renamed functions for curl API naming convention
+
+- endian: Moved write functions to new module
+
+- endian: Moved read functions to new module
+
+- endian: Introduced endian module
   
-  Observe that the REENTRANT cases are exactly the same as their
-  non-REENTRANT cases except for a `_REENTRANT` macro definition.
-  Merge all these pieces and build one big main function with different
-  cases, but reusing variables where logical.
+  To allow the little endian functions, currently used in two of the NTLM
+  source files, to be used by other modules such as the SMB module.
+
+- sepheaders.c: Applied curl oding standards
+
+- [Julien Nabet brought this change]
+
+  sepheaders.c: Fixed resource leak on failure
+
+- vtls: Use '(void) arg' for unused parameters
   
-  For the cases where the parameters where NULL, I looked at
-  lib/hostip4.c to get an idea of the parameters types.
+  Prefer void for unused parameters, rather than assigning an argument to
+  itself as a) unintelligent compilers won't optimize it out, b) it can't
+  be used for const parameters, c) it will cause compilation warnings for
+  clang with -Wself-assign and d) is inconsistent with other areas of the
+  curl source code.
+
+- smb.c: Fixed compilation warning
   
-  void-cast variables such as 'rc' to avoid -Wuninitialized errors.
+  smb.c:586: warning: conversion to 'short unsigned int' from 'int' may
+             alter its value
+
+- [Bill Nagel brought this change]
+
+  smb: Use the connection's upload buffer
   
-  Signed-off-by: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
+  Use the connection's upload buffer instead of allocating our own send
+  buffer.
 
-- [Peter Wu brought this change]
+- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with 1933f9d33c
 
-  cmake: drop _BSD_SOURCE macro usage
+- schannel: Moved the ISC return flag definitions to the SSPI module
   
-  autotools does not use features.h nor _BSD_SOURCE. As this macro
-  triggers warnings since glibc 2.20, remove it. It should not have
-  functional differences.
+  Moved our Initialize Security Context return attribute definitions to
+  the SSPI module, as a) these can be used by other SSPI based providers
+  and b) the ISC required attributes are defined there.
+

-Steve Holme (2 Nov 2014)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: Synced with d71ea7c01e
+- sockfilt.c: Fixed compilation warnings
   
-  Additionally, updated "GSSAPI" to "GSS-API" for a Cmake related change
-  as GSSAPI can be confused with the authentication mechanism rather than
-  a GSS-API implementation library such as MIT or Heimdal.
+  sockfilt.c:288: warning: conversion to 'DWORD' from 'size_t' may alter
+                  its value

-- build: Added WinIDN build configuration options
+- test1509: Fixed compilation warning
   
-  Added support for WinIDN build configurations to the VC6 project files.
+  lib1509.c:93:18: warning: conversion to 'long int' from 'size_t' may
+                   alter its value
 
-- build: Added WinIDN build configuration options
+- test556: Fixed compilation warning
   
-  Added support for WinIDN build configurations to the VC7 and VC7.1
-  project files.
+  lib556.c:90: warning: conversion to 'unsigned int' from 'size_t' may
+               alter its value
 
-- build: Fixed the pre-processor separator in Visual Studio project files
+- sasl_gssapi: Fixed use of dummy username with real username
+
+- vtls: Fixed compilation warning and an ignored return code
   
-  A left over from the VC6 project files, so mainly cosmetic in Visual
-  Studio .NET as it can handle both comma and semi-colon characters for
-  separating multiple pre-processor definitions.
+  curl_schannel.h:123: warning: right-hand operand of comma expression
+                       has no effect
   
-  However, the IDE uses semi-colons if the value is edited, and as such,
-  this may cause problems in future for anyone updating the files or
-  merging patches.
+  Some instances of the curlssl_close_all() function were declared with a
+  void return type whilst others as int. The schannel version returned
+  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN and others simply returned zero, but in all cases the
+  return code was ignored by the calling function Curl_ssl_close_all().
   
-  Used the Visual Studio IDE to correct the separator character.
-
-- build: Added optional specific version generation of VC project files
+  For the time being and to keep the internal API consistent, changed all
+  declarations to use a void return type.
   
-  ..when working from the git repository. This is particularly useful
-  for single development environments where the project files for all
-  supported versions of Visual Studio may not be required.
+  To reduce code we might want to consider removing the unimplemented
+  versions and use a void #define like schannel does.

+- test1520: Fixed initial teething problems
   
-  Prior to this change if x64 release was specified a failed attempt was

-- CURL_VERSION_KERBEROS4: Mark as deprecated
+- asiohiper.cpp: No need to initialise members of ConnInfo
   
-  Support for Kerberos V4 was removed in v7.33.0.
+  ...as calloc() automatically clears the area of memory with zeros.
 
-- sasl: Fixed Kerberos V5 inclusion when CURL_DISABLE_CRYPTO_AUTH is used
+- asiohiper.cpp: Updated for curl coding standards
   
-  Typically the USE_WINDOWS_SSPI definition would not be used when the
-  CURL_DISABLE_CRYPTO_AUTH define is, however, it is still a valid build
-  configuration and, as such, the SASL Kerberos V5 (GSSAPI) authentication
-  data structures and functions would incorrectly be used when they
-  shouldn't be.
+  ...with the exception of the start of block statement curly brackets.
+
+- code/docs: Use correct case for IPv4 and IPv6
   
-  Introduced a new USE_KRB5 definition that takes into account the use of
-  CURL_DISABLE_CRYPTO_AUTH like USE_SPNEGO and USE_NTLM do.
+  For consistency, as we seem to have a bit of a mixed bag, changed all
+  instances of ipv4 and ipv6 in comments and documentations to use the

-Daniel Stenberg (1 Nov 2014)
-- resume: consider a resume from [content-length] to be OK
+- code/docs: Use Unix rather than UNIX to avoid use of the trademark
   
-  Basically since servers often then don't respond well to this and
-  instead send the full contents and then libcurl would instead error out
-  with the assumption that the server doesn't support resume. As the data
-  is then already transfered, this is now considered fine.
+  Use Unix when generically writing about Unix based systems as UNIX is
+  the trademark and should only be used in a particular product's name.
+
+- ip2ip.c: Fixed compilation warning when IPv6 Scope ID not supported
   
-  Test case 1434 added to verify this. Test case 1042 slightly modified.

-Steve Holme (1 Nov 2014)
-- openssl: Use 'CURLcode result'
+- vtls: Don't set cert info count until memory allocation is successful
   
-  More standardisation of CURLcode usage and coding style.
+  Otherwise Curl_ssl_init_certinfo() can fail and set the num_of_certs
+  member variable to the requested count, which could then be used
+  incorrectly as libcurl closes down.
 
-- openssl: Use 'CURLcode result'
+- vtls: Use CURLcode for Curl_ssl_init_certinfo() return type
   
-  ...and some minor code style changes.
+  The return type for this function was 0 on success and 1 on error. This
+  was then examined by the calling functions and, in most cases, used to
+  return CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY.
+  
+  Instead use CURLcode for the return type and return the out of memory
+  error directly, propagating it up the call stack.
 
-- ftplistparser: We prefer 'CURLcode result'
+- configure: Use camel case for UNIX sockets feature output
+  
+  To match the curl --version output.
 
-- opts: Use common wording for user/password option names
+Marc Hoersken (26 Dec 2014)
+- sockfilt.c: Reduce the number of individual memory allocations
+  
+  Merge multiple internal arrays into one, even if some variables
+  will not not be used. They are all created with the number of

+  
+  Also fix possible thread handle leak in CloseHandle-loop.
 
-- CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY.3: Removed "This option is implemented for..." text
+- sockfilt.c: Replace 100ms sleep with thread throttle
   
-  As this is covered by the PROTOCOLS section and saves having to update
-  two parts of the document with the same information in future.
+  Improves performance of test cases 574 and 575 by 50%.
+  
+  A value of zero causes the thread to relinquish the remainder
+  of its time slice to any other thread of equal priority that is
+  ready to run. If there are no other threads of equal priority
+  ready to run, the function returns immediately, and the thread
+  continues execution.

-
-- sasl_sspi: Allow DIGEST-MD5 to use current windows credentials
+  Removed the WIN64 pre-processor definition from the libcurl project
+  files as:
   
-  Fixed the ability to use the current log-in credentials with DIGEST-MD5.
-  I had previously disabled this functionality in commit 607883f13c as I
-  couldn't get this to work under Windows 8, however, from testing HTTP
-  Digest authentication through Windows SSPI and then further testing of
-  this code I have found it works in Windows 7.
+  * WIN64 is not used in our source code
+  * The curl projects files don't define it
+  * It isn't required by or used in the platform SDK
+  * For backwards compatability curl_setup.h defines WIN32
+  * The compiler automatically defines _WIN64 for x64 builds
   
-  Some further investigation is required to see what the differences are
-  between Windows 7 and 8, but for now enable this functionality as the
-  code will return an error when AcquireCredentialsHandle() fails.
+  Historically Visual Studio projects have defined WIN32, in addition to
+  the compiler defined _WIN32 definition, and I had incorrectly changed
+  that to WIN64 for the x64 libcurl builds but not in the curl projects.
+  
+  As such, it is questionable whether this should be defined or not. For
+  more information see the following cache of a discussion that took
+  place on the microsoft.public.vc.mfc newsgroup:

+  Fixes SF bug 1149: http://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1449/
+
+- IPV6: address scope != scope id
+  There was a confusion between these: this commit tries to disambiguate them.
+  - Scope can be computed from the address itself.
+  - Scope id is scope dependent: it is currently defined as 1-based local
+    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
+    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
+    addresses.
+  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
+  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
+  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
+  to bind to an interface.
+  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
+  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
+  the interface index.

+  The ability to do HTTP requests over a UNIX domain socket has been
+  requested before, in Apr 2008 [0][1] and Sep 2010 [2]. While a
+  discussion happened, no patch seems to get through. I decided to give it
+  a go since I need to test a nginx HTTP server which listens on a UNIX
+  domain socket.
+  
+  One patch [3] seems to make it possible to use the
+  CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION function to gain a UNIX domain socket.
+  Another person wrote a Go program which can do HTTP over a UNIX socket
+  for Docker[4] which uses a special URL scheme (though the name contains
+  cURL, it has no relation to the cURL library).
+  
+  This patch considers support for UNIX domain sockets at the same level
+  as HTTP proxies / IPv6, it acts as an intermediate socket provider and
+  not as a separate protocol. Since this feature affects network
+  operations, a new feature flag was added ("unix-sockets") with a
+  corresponding CURL_VERSION_UNIX_SOCKETS macro.
+  
+  A new CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH option is added and documented. This
+  option enables UNIX domain sockets support for all requests on the
+  handle (replacing IP sockets and skipping proxies).
+  
+  A new configure option (--enable-unix-sockets) and CMake option
+  (ENABLE_UNIX_SOCKETS) can disable this optional feature. Note that I
+  deliberately did not mark this feature as advanced, this is a
+  feature/component that should easily be available.

-  This fixes a copy-paste mistake from commit 2968f957.
+  Instead of depending the socket domain type on use_ipv6, specify the
+  domain type (AF_INET / AF_INET6) as variable. An enum is used here with
+  switch to avoid compiler warnings in connect_to, complaining that rc
+  is possibly undefined (which is not possible as socket_domain is
+  always set).
+  
+  Besides abstracting the socket type, make the debugging messages be
+  independent on IP (introduce location_str which points to "port XXXXX").
+  Rename "ipv_inuse" to "socket_type" and tighten the scope (main).

-  Coverity CID 252518. This function is in general far too complicated for

+  CMake: Restore order-dependent header checks
   
-  As a sort of step forward, this script will now first try to get the
-  data from the HTTPS URL using curl, and only if that fails it will
-  switch back to the HTTP transfer using perl's native LWP functionality.
-  To reduce the risk of this script being tricked.
+  Revert commit 1269df2e3b (Cmake: Don't check for all headers each
+  time, 2014-08-15) and add a comment explaining the purpose of the
+  original code.
   
-  Using HTTPS to get a cert bundle introduces a chicken-and-egg problem so
-  we can't really ever completely disable HTTP, but chances are that most
-  users already have a ca cert bundle that trusts the mozilla.org site
-  that this script downloads from.
+  The check_include_file_concat macro is intended to be called multiple
+  times on a sequence of possibly dependent headers.  Later headers
+  may depend on earlier headers to provide declarations.  They cannot
+  be safely included independently on some platforms.
   
-  A future version of this script will probably switch to require a
-  dedicated "insecure" command line option to allow downloading over HTTP
-  (or unverified HTTPS).
+  For example, many POSIX APIs document including sys/types.h before some
+  other headers.  Also on some OS X versions sys/socket.h must be included
+  before net/if.h or the check for the latter will fail.

+- configure: Fixed NTLM missing from features when CURL_DISABLE_HTTP defined
+
+- build: Fixed no NTLM support for email when CURL_DISABLE_HTTP is defined
   
-  Historically the default "unknown" value for progress.size_dl and
-  progress.size_ul has been zero, since these values are initialized
-  implicitly by the calloc that allocates the curl handle that these
-  variables are a part of.  Users of curl that install progress
-  callbacks may expect these values to always be >= 0.
+  USE_NTLM would only be defined if: HTTP support was enabled, NTLM and
+  cryptography weren't disabled, and either a supporting cryptography
+  library or Windows SSPI was being compiled against.
   
-  Currently it is possible for progress.size_dl and progress.size_ul
-  to by set to a value of -1, if Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() or
-  Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize() are passed a "size" of -1 (which a few
-  places currently do, and a following patch will add more).  So
-  lets update Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() and Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize()
-  so they make sure that these variables always contain a value that
-  is >= 0.
+  This means it was not possible to build libcurl without HTTP support
+  and use NTLM for other protocols such as IMAP, POP3 and SMTP. Rather
+  than introduce a new SASL pre-processor definition, removed the HTTP
+  prerequisite just like USE_SPNEGO and USE_KRB5.
   
-  Updates test579 and test599.
+  Note: Winbind support still needs to be dependent on CURL_DISABLE_HTTP
+  as it is only available to HTTP at present.

-  Reported-by: David Meyer
+  Added !SSPI to the features list of the HTTP digest tests, as SSPI

+  internal functions, and we can't control the random numbers that get
+  used as part of the digest.

+  Reworked the input token (challenge message) storage as what is passed

-- low-speed-limit: avoid timeout flood
-  
-  Introducing Curl_expire_latest(). To be used when we the code flow only
-  wants to get called at a later time that is "no later than X" so that
-  something can be checked (and another timeout be added).
-  
-  The low-speed logic for example could easily be made to set very many
-  expire timeouts if it would be called faster or sooner than what it had
-  set its own timer and this goes for a few other timers too that aren't
-  explictiy checked for timer expiration in the code.
-  
-  If there's no condition the code that says if(time-passed >= TIME), then
-  Curl_expire_latest() is preferred to Curl_expire().
+- sasl_sspi: Added HTTP digest response generation code
+
+- http_digest: Added SSPI based challenge decoding code
+
+- http_digest: Added SSPI based clean-up code

+- http_digest: Added SSPI based authentication functions

+  causing CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN to be returned. A follow up commit will

-  function rather than a fixed buffer of 128 characters.
-
-- sasl_sspi: Fixed SPN not being converted to wchar under Unicode builds
+  This patch cleans up the automatically-generated (?) code and fixes one
+  case that will always fail due to syntax error.
   
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() would simply cast the SPN variable
-  to a TCHAR when calling InitializeSecurityContext(). This meant that,
-  under Unicode builds, it would not be valid wide character string.
+  HAVE_GETHOSTBYADDR_R_5_REENTRANT always failed because of a trailing
+  character ("int length;q"). Several parameter type and unused variable
+  warnings popped up. This causes a detection failure with -Werror.
   
-  Updated to use the recently introduced Curl_sasl_build_spn() function
-  which performs the correct conversion for us.
-
-- sasl: Introduced Curl_sasl_build_spn() for building a SPN
+  Observe that the REENTRANT cases are exactly the same as their
+  non-REENTRANT cases except for a `_REENTRANT` macro definition.
+  Merge all these pieces and build one big main function with different
+  cases, but reusing variables where logical.
   
-  Various parts of the libcurl source code build a SPN for inclusion in
-  authentication data. This information is either used by our own native
-  generation routines or passed to authentication functions in third-party
-  libraries such as SSPI. However, some of these instances use fixed
-  buffers rather than dynamically allocated ones and not all of those that
-  should, convert to wide character strings in Unicode builds.
+  For the cases where the parameters where NULL, I looked at
+  lib/hostip4.c to get an idea of the parameters types.
   
-  Implemented a common function that generates a SPN and performs the
-  wide character conversion where necessary.
-
-- sasl_sspi: Fixed memory leak with not releasing Package Info struct
+  void-cast variables such as 'rc' to avoid -Wuninitialized errors.

+- HTTP: return larger than 3 digit response codes too
   
-  To force each backend implementation to really attempt to provide proper
-  random. If a proper random function is missing, then we can explicitly
-  make use of the default one we use when TLS support is missing.
+  HTTP 1.1 is clearly specified to only allow three digit response codes,
+  and libcurl used sscanf("%3d") for that purpose. This made libcurl
+  support smaller numbers but not larger. It does now, but we will not
+  make any specific promises nor document this further since it is going
+  outside of what HTTP is.
   
-  This commit makes sure it works for darwinssl, gnutls, nss and openssl.

+  tests: move TESTCASES to Makefile.inc, add show for cmake
   
-  This is just fundamentally broken. SPNEGO (RFC4178) is a protocol which
-  allows client and server to negotiate the underlying mechanism which will
-  actually be used to authenticate. This is *often* Kerberos, and can also
-  be NTLM and other things. And to complicate matters, there are various
-  different OIDs which can be used to specify the Kerberos mechanism too.
+  This change allows runtests.pl to be run from the CMake builddir:
   
-  A SPNEGO exchange will identify *which* GSSAPI mechanism is being used,
-  and will exchange GSSAPI tokens which are appropriate for that mechanism.
+      export srcdir=/tmp/curl/tests;
+      perl -I$srcdir $srcdir/runtests.pl -l
   
-  But this SPNEGO implementation just strips the incoming SPNEGO packet
-  and extracts the token, if any. And completely discards the information
-  about *which* mechanism is being used. Then we *assume* it was Kerberos,
-  and feed the token into gss_init_sec_context() with the default
-  mechanism (GSS_S_NO_OID for the mech_type argument).
+  In order to make this possible, all test cases have been moved from
+  Makefile.am to Makefile.inc.
   
-  Furthermore... broken as this code is, it was never even *used* for input
-  tokens anyway, because higher layers of curl would just bail out if the
-  server actually said anything *back* to us in the negotiation. We assume
-  that we send a single token to the server, and it accepts it. If the server
-  wants to continue the exchange (as is required for NTLM and for SPNEGO
-  to do anything useful), then curl was broken anyway.

+- [Peter Wu brought this change]
+
+  cmake: enable IPv6 by default if available
   
-  So the only bit which actually did anything was the bit in
-  Curl_output_negotiate(), which always generates an *initial* SPNEGO
-  token saying "Hey, I support only the Kerberos mechanism and this is its
-  token".
+  ENABLE_IPV6 depends on HAVE_GETADDRINFO or you will get a
+  Curl_getaddrinfo_ex error. Enable IPv6 by default, disabling it if
+  struct sockaddr_in6 is not found in netinet/in.h.
   
-  You could have done that by manually just prefixing the Kerberos token
-  with the appropriate bytes, if you weren't going to do any proper SPNEGO
-  handling. There's no need for the FBOpenSSL library at all.
+  Note that HAVE_GETADDRINFO_THREADSAFE is still not set as it needs more
+  platform checks even though POSIX requires a thread-safe getaddrinfo.
   
-  The sane way to do SPNEGO is just to *ask* the GSSAPI library to do
-  SPNEGO. That's what the 'mech_type' argument to gss_init_sec_context()
-  is for. And then it should all Just Work™.
+  Verified on Arch Linux x86_64 with glibc 2.20-2 and Linux 3.16-rc7.
   
-  That 'sane way' will be added in a subsequent patch, as will bug fixes
-  for our failure to handle any exchange other than a single outbound
-  token to the server which results in immediate success.

+Daniel Stenberg (12 Sep 2014)
+- [Ray Satiro brought this change]
+
+  newlines: fix mixed newlines to LF-only
   
-  This is consistent with the existing obsolete error code naming
-  convention.
+  I use the curl repo mainly on Windows with the typical Windows git
+  checkout which converts the LF line endings in the curl repo to CRLF
+  automatically on checkout. The automatic conversion is not done on files
+  in the repo with mixed line endings. I recently noticed some weird
+  output with projects/build-openssl.bat that I traced back to mixed line
+  endings, so I scanned the repo and there are files (excluding the
+  test data) that have mixed line endings.
+  
+  I used this command below to do the scan. Unfortunately it's not as easy
+  as git grep, at least not on Windows. This gets the names of all the
+  files in the repo's HEAD, gets each of those files raw from HEAD, checks
+  for mixed line endings of both LF and CRLF, and prints the name if
+  mixed. I excluded path tests/data/test* because those can have mixed
+  line endings if I understand correctly.
+  
+  for f in `git ls-tree --name-only --full-tree -r HEAD`;
+  do if [ -n "${f##tests/data/test*}" ];
+      then git show "HEAD:$f" | \
+          perl -0777 -ne 'exit 1 if /([^\r]\n.*\r\n)|(\r\n.*[^\r]\n)/';
+      if [ $? -ne 0 ];
+          then echo "$f";
+      fi;
+  fi;
+  done

-Daniel Stenberg (18 Jun 2014)
-- opts: 29 more options as man pages
+- mk-ca-bundle.pl: first, try downloading HTTPS with curl
+  
+  As a sort of step forward, this script will now first try to get the
+  data from the HTTPS URL using curl, and only if that fails it will
+  switch back to the HTTP transfer using perl's native LWP functionality.
+  To reduce the risk of this script being tricked.
+  
+  Using HTTPS to get a cert bundle introduces a chicken-and-egg problem so
+  we can't really ever completely disable HTTP, but chances are that most
+  users already have a ca cert bundle that trusts the mozilla.org site
+  that this script downloads from.
+  
+  A future version of this script will probably switch to require a
+  dedicated "insecure" command line option to allow downloading over HTTP
+  (or unverified HTTPS).

-  curlbuild: fix GCC build on SPARC systems without configure script
+  Ensure progress.size_dl/progress.size_ul are always >= 0
+  
+  Historically the default "unknown" value for progress.size_dl and
+  progress.size_ul has been zero, since these values are initialized
+  implicitly by the calloc that allocates the curl handle that these
+  variables are a part of.  Users of curl that install progress
+  callbacks may expect these values to always be >= 0.
+  
+  Currently it is possible for progress.size_dl and progress.size_ul
+  to by set to a value of -1, if Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() or
+  Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize() are passed a "size" of -1 (which a few
+  places currently do, and a following patch will add more).  So
+  lets update Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() and Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize()
+  so they make sure that these variables always contain a value that
+  is >= 0.

+  Updates test579 and test599.

+- disconnect: don't touch easy-related state on disconnects
   
-  grrr, missed them in my previous fix
-
-- test1014: GSS-API is only in curl-config. not in curl
+  This was done to make sure NTLM state that is bound to a connection
+  doesn't survive and gets used for the subsequent request - but
+  disconnects can also be done to for example make room in the connection
+  cache and thus that connection is not strictly related to the easy
+  handle's current operation.
   
-  Follow-up to commit 121bcfee5d1. curl-config --features now lists
-  GSS-API but it is not a listed feature in curl -V. This should probably
-  be synchronized.
-
-- test1134: verify CREDSPERREQUEST for HTTP
+  The http authentication state is still kept in the easy handle since all
+  http auth _except_ NTLM is connection independent and thus survive over
+  multiple connections.
   
-  Verifies that the change in 68f0166a92 works as intended and that
-  different HTTP auth credentials to the same host still re-uses the
-  connection properly.

-- timers: fix timer regression involving redirects / reconnects
-  
-  In commit 0b3750b5c23c25f (released in 7.36.0) we fixed a timeout issue
-  but instead broke the timings.
-  
-  To fix this, I introduce a new timestamp to use for the timeouts and
-  restored the previous timestamp and timestamp position so that the old
-  timer functionality is restored.
-  
-  In addition to that, that change also broke connection timeouts for when
-  more than one connect was used (as it would then count the total time
-  from the first connect and not for the most recent one). Now
-  Curl_timeleft() has been modified so that it checks against different
-  start times depending on which timeout it checks.

-  Test 1303 is updated accordingly.

-  If the precision is indeed shorter than the string, don't strlen() to

+  The new host doesn't support If-Modified-Since nor ETags, meaning that
+  the script will now defer to download and do a post-transfer checksum
+  check to see if a new output is to be generated. The new output format
+  will hold the SHA1 checksum of the source file for that purpose.
   
-  I also added a unit test for curl_msnprintf to make sure this works and
-  that the fix doesn't a few other basic use cases. I found a POSIX

-  set.infilesize in this case was modified in several places, which could

-  
-  For example:
-    curl http://[::1]/file[1-3].txt
+  conncache: fix compiler warning
   
-  This creates no ambiguity, because there is no overlap between the
-  syntax of valid globs and valid IPv6 literals.  Globs contain hyphens
-  and at most 1 colon, while IPv6 literals have no hyphens, and at least 2
-  colons.
+  warning C4267: '=' : conversion from 'size_t' to 'long', possible loss

-  includes A-Z, in case someone decides to implement support for scopes
-  like [fe80::1%25eth0] in the future.

-  polarssl: avoid extra newlines in debug messages
+  Remove all traces of FBOpenSSL SPNEGO support
   
-  The debug messages printed inside PolarSSL always seems to end with a
-  newline. So 'infof()' should not add one. Besides the trace 'line'
-  should be 'const'.
-
-- rtsp: parse "Session:" header properly
+  This is just fundamentally broken. SPNEGO (RFC4178) is a protocol which
+  allows client and server to negotiate the underlying mechanism which will
+  actually be used to authenticate. This is *often* Kerberos, and can also
+  be NTLM and other things. And to complicate matters, there are various
+  different OIDs which can be used to specify the Kerberos mechanism too.
   
-  The parser skipped the initial letter, which presumably often is
-  whitespace but doesn't have to be.
+  A SPNEGO exchange will identify *which* GSSAPI mechanism is being used,
+  and will exchange GSSAPI tokens which are appropriate for that mechanism.
   
-  Reported-by: Mike Hasselberg
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2014-03/0134.html
-
-- runtests.pl: verify specified test cases
+  But this SPNEGO implementation just strips the incoming SPNEGO packet
+  and extracts the token, if any. And completely discards the information
+  about *which* mechanism is being used. Then we *assume* it was Kerberos,
+  and feed the token into gss_init_sec_context() with the default
+  mechanism (GSS_S_NO_OID for the mech_type argument).
   
-  To better allow arguments like "1 to 9999" without flooding the terminal
-  with error messages, the given test cases range is now checked and only
-  test numbers with existing files are actually run.

-- trynextip: don't store 'ai' on failed connects...
+  Furthermore... broken as this code is, it was never even *used* for input
+  tokens anyway, because higher layers of curl would just bail out if the
+  server actually said anything *back* to us in the negotiation. We assume
+  that we send a single token to the server, and it accepts it. If the server
+  wants to continue the exchange (as is required for NTLM and for SPNEGO
+  to do anything useful), then curl was broken anyway.
   
-  It leads to the "next family" tries starting from the wrong point and thus
-  fails!
+  So the only bit which actually did anything was the bit in
+  Curl_output_negotiate(), which always generates an *initial* SPNEGO
+  token saying "Hey, I support only the Kerberos mechanism and this is its
+  token".

-
-  polarssl: fix possible handshake timeout issue in multi.
+  You could have done that by manually just prefixing the Kerberos token
+  with the appropriate bytes, if you weren't going to do any proper SPNEGO
+  handling. There's no need for the FBOpenSSL library at all.
   
-  Because of the socket is unblocking, PolarSSL does need call to getsock to
-  get the action to perform in multi environment.
+  The sane way to do SPNEGO is just to *ask* the GSSAPI library to do
+  SPNEGO. That's what the 'mech_type' argument to gss_init_sec_context()
+  is for. And then it should all Just Work™.
   
-  In some cases, it might happen we have not received yet all data to perform
-  the handshake. ssh_handshake returns POLARSSL_ERR_NET_WANT_READ, the state
-  is updated but because of the getsock has not the proper #define macro to,
-  the library never prevents to select socket for input thus the socket will
-  never be awaken when last data is available. Thus it leads to timeout.
+  That 'sane way' will be added in a subsequent patch, as will bug fixes
+  for our failure to handle any exchange other than a single outbound
+  token to the server which results in immediate success.

-  polarssl: drop use of 1.2 compatibility header.
-  
-  API has changed since version 1.3. A compatibility header has been created
-  to ensure forward compatibility for code using old API:
-   * x509 certificate structure has been renamed to from x509_cert to
-     x509_crt
-   * new dedicated setter for RSA certificates ssl_set_own_cert_rsa,
-     ssl_set_own_cert is for generic keys
-   * ssl_default_ciphersuites has been replaced by function
-     ssl_list_ciphersuites()
+  ntlm_wb: Fix hard-coded limit on NTLM auth packet size
   
-  This patch drops the use of the compatibly header.
+  Bumping it to 1KiB in commit aaaf9e50ec is all very well, but having hit
+  a hard limit once let's just make it cope by reallocating as necessary.

+- CURLOPT_DNS_LOCAL_IP4.3: better short desc
 
-- tool_getparam: Moved tool_help() call into operate()
+Dan Fandrich (20 Jun 2014)
+- opts: document CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY among other return values
 
-- tool_getparam: Moved hugehelp() call into operate()
+- opts: fixed some typos
 
-- tool_getparam: Moved tool_version_info() call into operate()
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Jun 2014)
+- opts: various corrections
 
-- tool_cfgable: Removed list_engine flag from config structure
+- opts: add the rest of the options
   
-  In preparation for separating the global config options from the per
-  operation config options, reworked the list engines code to not use a
-  member variable in the Configurable structure.
+  ... and fixed mancheck to ignore obsolete options
 
-- tool_operate: Start to use CURLcode rather than int for return codes
+- opts: the final bunch of options as man pages
   
-  To help assist with the detection of incorrect return codes, as per
-  commits ee23d13a79, 33b8960dc8 and aba98991a5, updated the operate
-  based functions to return CURLcode error codes.
+  Now all current options have their own man pages.
 
-- tool: Fixed incorrect return code when setting HTTP request fails
-  
-  During initialisation SetHTTPrequest() may fail and cURL would return
-  PARAM_BAD_USE, which is equivalent to CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN in cURL error
-  terms.
-  
-  Instead, return CURLE_FAILED_INIT as we do for other functions that may
-  fail during initialisation.
+- opts: 37 additional man pages
 
-- tool_getparam: Moved version information into separate function in tool_help
+- CURLOPT_URL: move up the text from "Notes"
 
-- tool_operhlp.h: Fixed compilation warning
-  
-  warning: 'struct Configurable' declared inside parameter list
+- ROADMAP: removed, now ROADMAP.md
 
-- tool_operhlp: Consolidated engine output code into tool_help
+- ROADMAP.md: make it markdown formatted
 
-- tool_operate: Moved list engines into separate function in tool_help
+- ROADMAP: initial commit of "curl the next few years"
+  
+  To be further discussed, debated and edited
 
-Marc Hoersken (22 Feb 2014)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: added note about impact of changes to WinSSL defaults
+- opts: more man pages
 
-- stunnel: regenerated self-signed test certificate with SHA1 hash
-  
-  The previous test certificate contained a MD5 hash which is not
-  supported using TLSv1.2 with Schannel on Windows 7 or newer.
-  
-  See the update to this blog post on IEInternals / MSDN:
-  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/03/25/
-  misbehaving-https-servers-impair-tls-1.1-and-tls-1.2.aspx
-  
-  "Update: If the server negotiates a TLS1.2 connection with a
-  Windows 7 or 8 schannel.dll-using client application, and it
-  provides a certificate chain which uses the (weak) MD5 hash
-  algorithm, the client will abort the connection (TCP/IP FIN)
-  upon receipt of the certificate."
+- CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH.3: added missing 'T'
 
-Dan Fandrich (22 Feb 2014)
-- easy: Fixed a memory leak on OOM condition
+- opts: makefile now includes all current man pages
 
-Steve Holme (20 Feb 2014)
-- tool_paramhlp: Fixed compilation warnings
-  
-  declaration of 'index' shadows a global declaration
+- opts: 11 more man pages
 
-- lib1515.c: Fixed #include path in commit 647f83e809
+Dan Fandrich (18 Jun 2014)
+- opts: document CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY as RETURN VALUE
 
-Daniel Stenberg (19 Feb 2014)
-- [Maks Naumov brought this change]
+- opts: fixed a couple of typos
 
-  test1515: fix compilation with msvc
-  
-  ... or any other systems lacking a native snprintf
+Patrick Monnerat (18 Jun 2014)
+- OS400: make it compilable again. Make RPG binding up to date.
 
-- SFTP: skip reading the dir when NOBODY=1
-  
-  When asking for an SFTP directory with NOBODY set, no directory contents
-  should be retrieved.
+- buildconf: do not search tools in current directory.
+
+Dan Fandrich (18 Jun 2014)
+- curl.h: renamed CURLOPT_DEPRECATEDx to CURLOPT_OBSOLETEx
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2014-02/0155.html
+  This is consistent with the existing obsolete error code naming
+  convention.
 
-Dan Fandrich (18 Feb 2014)
-- axtls: comment the call ssl_read repeatedly loop
+Daniel Stenberg (18 Jun 2014)

 .B curl
 is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported
 protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP,
-LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP).  The

    it is necessary to make definition of preprocessor symbol USE_LWIPSOCK
    visible to libcurl and curl compilation processes. To set this definition
    you have the following alternatives:
 
    - Modify lib/config-win32.h and src/config-win32.h
    - Modify lib/Makefile.vc6
-   - Add definition to Project/Settings/C/C++/General/Preprocessor Definitions
-     in the vc6libcurl.dsw/vc6libcurl.dsp Visual C++ 6 IDE project.
+   - Modify the "Preprocessor Definitions" in the libcurl project
+
+   Note: The pre-processor settings can be found using the Visual Studio IDE
+   under "Project -> Settings -> C/C++ -> General" in VC6 and "Project ->
+   Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor" in later
+   versions.
 
    Once that libcurl has been built with BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack support,
    in order to use it with your program it is mandatory that your program
    includes lwIP header file <lwip/opt.h> (or another lwIP header that includes
    this) before including any libcurl header. Your program does not need the
    USE_LWIPSOCK preprocessor definition which is for libcurl internals only.

 .SH DESCRIPTION
-This function converts the given input string to an URL encoded string and
-returns that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not a-z,
-A-Z, 0-9, '-', '.', '_' or '~' are converted to their "URL escaped" version
-(%NN where NN is a two-digit hexadecimal number).
+This function converts the given input \fBstring\fP to an URL encoded string
+and returns that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not
+a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '-', '.', '_' or '~' are converted to their "URL escaped"
+version (%NN where NN is a two-digit hexadecimal number).
 
 If the \fBlength\fP argument is set to 0 (zero), \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP
 uses strlen() on the input \fBurl\fP to find out the size.
 
 You must \fIcurl_free(3)\fP the returned string when you're done with it.
 .SH AVAILABILITY
 Added in 7.15.4 and replaces the old \fIcurl_escape(3)\fP function.
 .SH RETURN VALUE
 A pointer to a zero terminated string or NULL if it failed.

 <p class="level0">Before libcurl 7.32.0, when a specific handle was unpaused with this function, there was no particular forced rechecking or similar of the socket's state, which made the continuation of the transfer get delayed until next multi-socket call invoke or even longer. Alternatively, the user could forcibly call for example curl_multi_socket_all(3) - with a rather hefty performance penalty. 
 <p class="level0">Starting in libcurl 7.32.0, unpausing a transfer will schedule a timeout trigger for that handle 1 millisecond into the future, so that a curl_multi_socket_action( ...

 <p class="level0">When pausing a read by returning the magic return code from a write callback, the read data is already in libcurl's internal buffers so it'll have to keep it in an allocated buffer until the reading is again unpaused using this function. 
 <p class="level0">If the downloaded data is compressed and is asked to get uncompressed automatically on download, libcurl will continue to uncompress the entire downloaded chunk and it will cache the data uncompressed. This has the side- effect that if you download something that is compressed a lot, it can result in a very large data amount needing to be allocated to save the data during the pause. This said, you should probably consider not using paused reading if you allow libcurl to uncompress data automatically. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>

-contained in the given multi handle set.  It will block until activity is
-detected on at least one of the handles or \fItimeout_ms\fP has passed.
+\fIcurl_multi_wait(3)\fP polls all file descriptors used by the curl easy
+handles contained in the given multi handle set.  It will block until activity
+is detected on at least one of the handles or \fItimeout_ms\fP has passed.
 Alternatively, if the multi handle has a pending internal timeout that has a
 shorter expiry time than \fItimeout_ms\fP, that shorter time will be used
 instead to make sure timeout accuracy is reasonably kept.
 
 The calling application may pass additional curl_waitfd structures which are
 similar to \fIpoll(2)\fP's pollfd structure to be waited on in the same call.
 
-On completion, if \fInumfds\fP is supplied, it will be populated with the
+On completion, if \fInumfds\fP is non-NULL, it will be populated with the
 total number of file descriptors on which interesting events occured. This
 number can include both libcurl internal descriptors as well as descriptors
 provided in \fIextra_fds\fP.
 
 If no extra file descriptors are provided and libcurl has no file descriptor
 to offer to wait for, this function will return immediately.

 library loader to set up.  Therefore, a program must call a library
 function after the program is loaded and running to finish setting up
 the library code.  For example, when libcurl is built for SSL
 capability via the GNU TLS library, there is an elaborate tree inside
 that library that describes the SSL protocol.
 
-\fIcurl_global_init()\fP is the function that you must call.  This may
-allocate resources (e.g. the memory for the GNU TLS tree mentioned
-above), so the companion function \fIcurl_global_cleanup()\fP releases
-them.
-
-The basic rule for constructing a program that uses libcurl is this:
-Call \fIcurl_global_init()\fP, with a \fICURL_GLOBAL_ALL\fP argument,
-immediately after the program starts, while it is still only one
-thread and before it uses libcurl at all.  Call
-\fIcurl_global_cleanup()\fP immediately before the program exits, when
-the program is again only one thread and after its last use of
-libcurl.
+\fIcurl_global_init(3)\fP is the function that you must call.  This may

+program exits, when the program is again only one thread and after its last
+use of libcurl.
 
 You can call both of these multiple times, as long as all calls meet
 these requirements and the number of calls to each is the same.
 
 It isn't actually required that the functions be called at the beginning
 and end of the program -- that's just usually the easiest way to do it.

 code you are writing to use libcurl is not the main program, but rather
 a modular piece of a program, e.g. another library.  As a module,
 your code doesn't know about other parts of the program -- it doesn't
 know whether they use libcurl or not.  And its code doesn't necessarily
 run at the start and end of the whole program.
 
-A module like this must have global constant functions of its own,
-just like \fIcurl_global_init()\fP and \fIcurl_global_cleanup()\fP.
-The module thus has control at the beginning and end of the program
-and has a place to call the libcurl functions.  Note that if multiple
-modules in the program use libcurl, they all will separately call the
-libcurl functions, and that's OK because only the first

 <p class="level0">There are many bindings available that bring libcurl access to your favourite language. Look elsewhere for documentation on those.

This essentially means you call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_init.html">curl_global_init</a> at the start of your program and <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_global_cleanup.html">curl_global_cleanup</a> at the end.  See <a class="bold" href="#GLOBAL">GLOBAL CONSTANTS</a> below for details. 
 <p class="level0">To transfer files, you create an "easy handle" using <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_init.html">curl_easy_init</a> for a single individual transfer (in either direction).

Options you set with <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_setopt.html">curl_easy_setopt</a> stick. They will be used on every repeated use of this handle until you either change the option, or you reset them all with <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_reset.html">curl_easy_reset</a>. 
 <p class="level0">To actually transfer data you have the option of using the "easy" interface, or the "multi" interface. 
-<p class="level0">The easy interface is a synchronous interface with which you call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_perform.html">curl_easy_perform</a> and let it perform the transfer. When it is completed, the function returns and you can continue. More details are found in the <span Class="emphasis">libcurl-easy(3)</span> man page. 
-<p class="level0">The multi interface on the other hand is an asynchronous interface, that you call and that performs only a little piece of the transfer on each invoke. It is perfect if you want to do things while the transfer is in progress, or similar. The multi interface allows you to select() on libcurl action, and even to easily download multiple files simultaneously using a single thread. See further details in the <span Class="emphasis">libcurl-multi(3)</span> man page.

 <p class="level0">There are a variety of constants that libcurl uses, mainly through its internal use of other libraries, which are too complicated for the library loader to set up.  Therefore, a program must call a library function after the program is loaded and running to finish setting up the library code.  For example, when libcurl is built for SSL capability via the GNU TLS library, there is an elaborate tree inside that library that describes the SSL protocol. 
-<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">curl_global_init()</span> is the function that you must call.  This may allocate resources (e.g. the memory for the GNU TLS tree mentioned above), so the companion function <span Class="emphasis">curl_global_cleanup()</span> releases them.

 <p class="level0">These global constant functions are <span Class="emphasis">not thread safe</span>, so you must not call them when any other thread in the program is running.  It isn't good enough that no other thread is using libcurl at the time, because these functions internally call similar functions of other libraries, and those functions are similarly thread-unsafe.  You can't generally know what these libraries are, or whether other threads are using them. 
 <p class="level0">The global constant situation merits special consideration when the code you are writing to use libcurl is not the main program, but rather a modular piece of a program, e.g. another library.  As a module, your code doesn't know about other parts of the program -- it doesn't know whether they use libcurl or not.

 GNV currently has a bug where configure scripts take a long time to run.
 Some of the configure steps take a while to complete, and on a 600 Mhz
