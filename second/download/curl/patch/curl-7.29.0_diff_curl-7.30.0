-dnl CURL_CHECK_FUNC_RECVFROM
-dnl -------------------------------------------------
-dnl Test if the socket recvfrom() function is available,
-dnl and check its return type and the types of its
-dnl arguments. If the function succeeds HAVE_RECVFROM
-dnl will be defined, defining the types of the arguments
-dnl in RECVFROM_TYPE_ARG1, RECVFROM_TYPE_ARG2, and so on
-dnl to RECVFROM_TYPE_ARG6, defining also the type of the
-dnl function return value in RECVFROM_TYPE_RETV.
-dnl Notice that the types returned for pointer arguments
-dnl will actually be the type pointed by the pointer.

+Version 7.30.0 (12 Apr 2013)
 
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message: fix buffer overflow
+Daniel Stenberg (12 Apr 2013)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: cleaned up for 7.30 (synced with 5c5e1a1cd20)
   
-  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
-  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
-  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.
+  Most notable the security advisory:
+  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20130412.html
+
+- test1218: another cookie tailmatch test
   
-  This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a
-  server that a libcurl based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or
-  IMAP. For applications that accept user provided URLs, it is also
-  thinkable that a malicious user would feed an application with a URL to
-  a server hosting code targetting this flaw.
+  ... and make 1216 also verify it with a file input
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20130206.html
+  These tests verify commit 3604fde3d3c9b0d, the fix for the "cookie
+  domain tailmatch" vulnerability. See
+  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20130412.html
 
-Steve Holme (6 Feb 2013)
-- FEATURES: Removed erroneous whitespace
-  
-  Removed whitespace introduced in commit 5f8f20f5e65b that caused
-  formatting issues when generating the website docs.

-- setup-vms.h: post VMS patch cleanup - III
+  cookie: fix tailmatching to prevent cross-domain leakage
   
-  - rename post-config-vms.h to setup-vms.h
-  - move its inclusion into proper location in curl_setup.h
-
-- vms_show: post VMS patch cleanup - II
+  Cookies set for 'example.com' could accidentaly also be sent by libcurl
+  to the 'bexample.com' (ie with a prefix to the first domain name).
   
-  - remove multiple declarations of vms_show and add comments
-
-- tool_main.c: post VMS patch cleanup - I
+  This is a security vulnerabilty, CVE-2013-1944.
   
-  - remove header inclusion already done in curl_setup_once.h

-  Added SMTP, SMTPS, POP3, POP3S, IMAP and IMAPS features.
+  The previously applied patch didnt work on Windows; we cant rely
+  on shell commands like 'echo' since they act diffently on each
+  platform and each shell.
+  In order to keep this script platform-independent the code must
+  only use pure Perl.
 
-- imap.h: Corrected incorrect comment clarification
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Apr 2013)
+- test1217: verify parsing 257 responses with "rubbish" before path
   
-  Corrected comment clarification made in commit 167717b8069a.
+  Test 1217 verifies commit e0fb2d86c9f78, and without that change this
+  test fails.

+  FTP: handle "rubbish" in front of directory name in 257 responses
   
-  8 more bug fixes mentioned
-
-- [John E. Malmberg brought this change]
-
-  VMS: fix and generate the VMS build config
+  When doing PWD, there's a 257 response which apparently some servers
+  prefix with a comment before the path instead of after it as is
+  otherwise the norm.
   
-  config_h.com is a new file that generates a config.h file based on the
-  curl_config.h.in file and a quick scan of the configure script.  This is
-  actually a generic procedure that is shared with other VMS packages.
+  Failing to parse this, several otherwise legitimate use cases break.
   
-  The existing pre-built config-vms.h had over 100 entries that were not
-  correct and in some cases conflicted with the build options available in
-  the build_vms.com.
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-04/0113.html
+
+Guenter Knauf (9 Apr 2013)
+- Fixed ares-enabled builds with static makefiles.
+
+- Fixed lost OpenSSL output with "-t".
   
-  generate_config_vms_h_curl.com is a helper procedure to the
-  config_h.com.  It covers the cases that the generic config_h.com is not
-  able to figure out, and accepts input from the build_vms.com procedure.
+  The OpenSSL pipe wrote to the final CA bundle file, but the encoded PEM
+  output wrote to a temporary file.  Consequently, the OpenSSL output was
+  lost when the temp file was renamed to the final file at script finish
+  (overwriting the final file written earlier by openssl).
+  Patch posted to the list by Richard Michael (rmichael edgeofthenet org).
+
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Apr 2013)
+- test1216: test tailmatching cookie domains
   
-  build_curlbuild_h.com is a new file to generate the curlbuild.h file
-  that Curl is now using when it is using a curl_config.h file.
+  This test is an attempt to repeat the problem YAMADA Yasuharu reported
+  at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2013-04/0108.html
+
+- RELEASe-NOTES: synced with 29fdb2700f797
   
-  post-config-vms.h is a new file that is needed to provide VMS specific
-  definitions, and most of them need to be set before the system header
-  files are included.
+  added "tcpkeepalive on Mac OS X"
+
+Nick Zitzmann (8 Apr 2013)
+- darwinssl: disable insecure ciphers by default
   
-  The VMS build procedure is fixed:
+  I noticed that aria2's SecureTransport code disables insecure ciphers such
+  as NULL, anonymous, IDEA, and weak-key ciphers used by SSLv3 and later.
+  That's a good idea, and now we do the same thing in order to prevent curl
+  from accessing a "secure" site that only negotiates insecure ciphersuites.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (8 Apr 2013)

+
+  tcpkeepalive: Support CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE on OSX
   
-     1. Fixed to link in the correct HP ssl library.
-     2. Fixed to detect if HP Kerberos is installed.
-     3. Fixed to detect if HP LDAP is installed.
-     4. Fixed to detect if gnv$libzshr is installed.
-     5. Simplified the input parameter parsing to not use a loop.
-     6. Warn that 64 bit pointer option support is not complete
-        in comments.
-     7. Default to IEEE floating if platform supports it so
-        resulting libcurl will be compatible with other
-        open source projects on VMS.
-     8. Default to LARGEFILE if platform supports it.
-     9. Default to enable SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, libz
-        if the libraries are present.
-     10. Build with exact case global symbols for libcurl.
-     11. Generate linker option file needed.
-     12. Compiler list option only commonly needed items.
-     13. fulllist option for those who really want it.
-     14. Create debug symbol file on Alpha, IA64.
+  MacOS X doesn't have TCP_KEEPIDLE/TCP_KEEPINTVL but only a single
+  TCP_KEEPALIVE (see
+  http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#DOCUMENTATION/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man4/tcp.4.html).
+  Here is a patch for CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE on OSX platforms.
 
-- Curl_proxyCONNECT: return once CONNECT is sent
+- configure: remove CURL_CHECK_FUNC_RECVFROM
   
-  By doing this unconditionally, we infer a simpler and more defined
-  behavior. This also has the upside that test 1021 no longer fails for me
-  even if I run with valgrind.
+  1 - We don't use the results from the test and we never did. recvfrom()
+  is only used by the TFTP code and it has not caused any problems.
   
-  Also fixed some wrong comments.
+  2 - the CURL_CHECK_FUNC_RECVFROM function is extremely slow

-  The flag may improve the SSL-connection shutdown in case of an
-  error. This means it might be a good improvement in the future.
+  Previously it only compared credentials if the requested needle
+  connection wasn't using a proxy. This caused NTLM authentication
+  failures when using proxies as the authentication code wasn't send on
+  the connection where the challenge arrived.
   
-  Fixes bug/issue #1187 - thanks for the report
+  Added test 1215 to verify: NTLM server authentication through a proxy

+
+  connect: treat an interface bindlocal() problem as a non-fatal error
   
-  Fixed an issue where (lib)curl is compiled without support for a
-  supported challenge-response based SASL authentication mechanism, such
-  as CRAM-MD5 or NTLM, the server doesn't support the LOGIN or PLAIN
-  mechanisms and (lib)curl doesn't fallback to Clear Text authentication.
+  I am using curl_easy_setopt(CURLOPT_INTERFACE, "if!something") to force
+  transfers to use a particular interface but the transfer fails with
+  CURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED, "Failed binding local connection end" if the
+  interface I specify has no IPv6 address. The cause is as follows:
   
-  Note: In order to fallback to Clear Text authentication properly this
-  fix adds support for the LOGINDISABLED server capability.
-  imap: Fixed no known authentication mechanism when fallback is required
+  The remote hostname resolves successfully and has an IPv6 address and an
+  IPv4 address.
   
-  Fixed an issue where (lib)curl is compiled without support for a
-  supported challenge-response based SASL authentication mechanism, such
-  as CRAM-MD5 or NTLM, the server doesn't support the LOGIN or PLAIN
-  mechanisms and (lib)curl doesn't fallback to Clear Text authentication.
+  cURL attempts to connect to the IPv6 address first.
   
-  Note: In order to fallback to Clear Text authentication properly this
-  fix adds support for the LOGINDISABLED server capability.
+  bindlocal (in lib/connect.c) fails because Curl_if2ip cannot find an
+  IPv6 address on the interface.

+  - Filter the choice of address in Curl_if2ip to only consider addresses
+  with the same scope ID as the connection address (mismatched scope for
+  local and remote address does not result in a working connection).
   
-  Make the actual connection get detected on a single spot to reduce code
-  duplication.
+  - bindlocal was ignoring the scope ID of addresses returned by
+  Curl_if2ip . Now it uses them.

+  This workaround fixes an issue on MinGW/Msys regarding the Perl
+  testsuite scripts not being able to signal or control the server
+  processes. The MinGW Perl runtime only sees the Msys processes and
+  their corresponding PIDs, but sockfilt (and other servers) wrote the
+  Windows PID into their PID-files. Since this PID is useless to the
+  testsuite, the write_pidfile function was changed to search for the
+  Msys PID and write that into the PID-file.

+  The Microsoft knowledge-base article

+  
+  In order to properly extend this support for all targets curl.h
+  would have to define curl_wcsdup_callback prototype and consequently

+  defined in curlbuild.h and this pulling whatever system header is
+  required to get wchar_t definition.

-  Notes:
+  After having done a POST over a CONNECT request, the 'rewindaftersend'

-  When running a configure script that has nested packages (for example
-  libcurl's configure with --enable-ares and c-ares sources embedded in
-  curl tree) and AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([nested-subdir]) machinery is used to
-  automatically run the nested configure script from within the parent

-  inherit shell variables exported from the parent _shell_ script.
+  This should be tested for in a new test case!
   
-  If for example parent configure script sets and exports LDFLAGS and LIBS
-  variables with proper values in order to link either a parent library or
-  program with a library which will be configured and built by a nested
-  package; It will happen that when the nested configure script runs, the
-  nested library does not exist yet and _any_ link-test done in the nested

-- always-multi: always use non-blocking internals
+- Multiple pipelines and limiting the number of connections.
   
-  Remove internal separated behavior of the easy vs multi intercace.
-  curl_easy_perform() is now using the multi interface itself.
+  Introducing a number of options to the multi interface that
+  allows for multiple pipelines to the same host, in order to
+  optimize the balance between the penalty for opening new
+  connections and the potential pipelining latency.
   
-  Several minor multi interface quirks and bugs have been fixed in the
-  process.
+  Two new options for limiting the number of connections:
   
-  Much help with debugging this has been provided by: Yang Tse
+  CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of running connections
+  to the same host. When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
+  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
+  finished, so we can reuse the connection.
+  
+  CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS - Limits the number of connections in total.
+  When adding a handle that exceeds this limit,
+  that handle will be put in a pending state until another handle is
+  finished. The free connection will then be reused, if possible, or
+  closed if the pending handle can't reuse it.
+  
+  Several new options for pipelining:
+  
+  CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH - Limits the pipeling length. If a
+  pipeline is "full" when a connection is to be reused, a new connection
+  will be opened if the CURLMOPT_MAX_xxx_CONNECTIONS limits allow it.
+  If not, the handle will be put in a pending state until a connection is
+  ready (either free or a pipe got shorter).
+  
+  CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - A pipelined connection will not
+  be reused if it is currently processing a transfer with a content
+  length that is larger than this.
+  
+  CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE - A pipelined connection will not
+  be reused if it is currently processing a chunk larger than this.
+  
+  CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL - A blacklist of hosts that don't allow
+  pipelining.
+  
+  CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SERVER_BL - A blacklist of server types that don't allow
+  pipelining.
+  
+  See the curl_multi_setopt() man page for details.

+  to it. Using "extern int vms_show = 0" also creates a globaldef.
   
-  An example of a command-line option doing so is the -k option that sets
-  CURLOPT_SLL_VERIFYPEER and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST to 0L, when the
-  defaults are non-zero.
+  The use of the extern by itself does declare a psect but does not declare
+  a globalsymbol. It does declare a globalref. But the linker needs one and
+  only one globaldef or there is an error.

+- imap: Fixed handling of untagged responses for the STORE custom command
   
-      Additionally lib/setup.h has always used __SETUP_ONCE_H macro to
-      protect inclusion of setup_once.h even after commit ec691ca3, this
-      was to avoid a circular header inclusion triggered when building a
-      c-ares enabled version with c-ares sources available which also has
-      a setup_once.h header. Commit ec691ca3 exposes the real nature of
-      __SETUP_ONCE_H usage in lib/setup.h, it is a header inclusion guard
-      foreign to libcurl belonging to c-ares's setup_once.h
+  Added an exception, for the STORE command, to the untagged response
+  processor in imap_endofresp() as servers will back respones containing
+  the FETCH keyword instead.

+- curlbuild.h.dist: enhance non-configure GCC ABI detection logic
   
-      The renaming this commit does, fixes the circular header inclusion,
-      and as such removes the need and usage of a header inclusion guard
-      foreign to libcurl. Macro __SETUP_ONCE_H no longer used in libcurl.
+  GCC specific adjustments:
   
-  2 - Due to the circular interdependency of old lib/setup_once.h and the
-      c-ares setup_once.h header, old file lib/setup_once.h has carried
-      back from 2006 up to now days an alarming and prominent notice about
-      the need of keeping libcurl's and c-ares's setup_once.h in sync.
+  - check __ILP32__ before 32 and 64bit processor architectures in
+    order to detect ILP32 programming model on 64 bit processors
+    which, of course, also support LP64 programming model, when using
+    gcc 4.7 or newer.
   
-      Given that this commit fixes the circular interdependency, the need
-      and presence of mentioned notice is removed.
+  - keep 32bit processor architecture checks in order to support gcc
+    versions older than 4.7 which don't define __ILP32__
   
-      All mentioned interdependencies come back from now old days when
-      the c-ares project lived inside a curl subdirectory. This commit
-      removes last traces of such fact.
+  - check __LP64__ for gcc 3.3 and newer, while keeping 64bit processor
+    architecture checks for older versions which don't define __LP64__

-  This commit fixes support for sockets that are ready to accept
-  a new connection and have previously been put into listening mode.
+  Enriched IMAP capabilities of ftpserver.pl in order to be able to
+  add tests for the new IMAP features.
   
-  It also includes changes which are the result of investigation
-  regarding Windows STDIN. These changes are the preparation for further
-  improvements regarding support for reading data from STDIN on Windows.
+  * Added support for APPEND - Saves uploaded data to log/upload.$testno
+  * Added support for LIST - Returns the contents of <reply/> section in
+    the current test, like e.g FETCH.
+  * Added support for STORE - Returns hardcoded updated flags
+  * Changed handling of SELECT - Returns much more information in the
+    usual set of untagged responses; uses hardcoded data from an example
+    in the IMAP RFC
+  * Changed handling of FETCH - Fixed response format
+
+- imap: Added check for empty UID in FETCH command
   
-  Open issue: WaitForMultipleObjectsEx does not support PIPE handles
-  which are returned by GetStdHandle while running without a GUI.
+  As the UID has to be specified by the user for the FETCH command to work
+  correctly, added a check to imap_fetch(), although strictly speaking it
+  is protected by the call from imap_perform().

-  1. When the downloaded data file from Mozilla is current, but the output

+  Minor tidy up of code layout and comments following recent changes.
+
+- imap: Simplified the imap_state_append_resp() function
   
-  2. added -f option to force re-processing the file.  Useful for
-  debugging/testing the process.
+  Introduced the result code variable to simplify the state changes and
+  remove the hard returns.
+
+- imap: Changed successful response logic in imap_state_append_resp()
   
-  3. added support for output to '-' (stdout), allowing the output to be
-  piped.
+  For consistency changed the logic of the imap_state_append_resp()
+  function to test for an unsucessful continuation response rather than a
+  succesful one.
+
+- imap: Standardised imapcode condition tests
   
-  4. All progress and error messages go to STDERR rather than STDOUT (3)

+- imap: Moved imap_append() to be with the other perform functions
+

+
+  imap: Enabled APPEND support in imap_perform()
   
-  5. The script opened and closed the output file many times
-  unnecessarily.  It now opens it once, does the output and closes it.
+  Added logic in imap_perform() to perform an APPEND rather than SELECT
+  and FETCH if an upload has been specified.
+
+- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
+
+  imap: Implemented APPEND final processing
   
-  6. Backup of the input files happens after successful processing, not
-  before.
+  The APPEND operation needs to be performed in several steps:
+    1) We send "<tag> APPEND <mailbox> <flags> {<size>}\r\n"
+    2) Server responds with continuation respose "+ ...\r\n"
+    3) We start the transfer and send <size> bytes of data
+    4) Only now we end the request command line by sending "\r\n"
+    5) Server responds with "<tag> OK ...\r\n"
   
-  7. The output is written to a temporary file, and renamed to the
-  requested name after backup - this greatly reduces the window where the
-  file can be seen partially written.
+  This commit performs steps 4 and 5, in the DONE phase, as more
+  processing is required after the transfer.

-- curl_setup.h: remove redundant include guard
+- [Jiri Hruska brought this change]
 
-- build and tests: curl_10char_object_name() shell function
+  imap: Introduced FETCH_FINAL state for processing final fetch responses
   
-  lib/objnames.inc provides definition of curl_10char_object_name() shell
-  function. The intended purpose of this function is to transliterate a
-  (*.c) source file name that may be longer than 10 characters, or not,
-  into a string with at most 10 characters which may be used as an OS/400
-  object name.
+  A typical FETCH response can be broken down into four parts:
   
-  Test case 1221 does unit testng of this function and also verifies
-  that it is possible to generate distinct short object names for all
-  curl and libcurl *.c source file names.
+    1) "* <uid> FETCH (<what> {<size>}\r\n", using continuation syntax
+    2) <size> bytes of the actual message
+    3) ")\r\n", finishing the untagged response
+    4) "<tag> OK ...", finishing the command
   
-  lib/objnames-test.sh is the shell script used for test case 1221.
+  Part 1 is read in imap_fetch_resp(), part 2 is consumed in the PERFORM
+  phase by the transfer subsystem, parts 3 and 4 are currently ignored.
+
+- imap: fix autobuild warning

-  AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, thing which automake has been doing since automake
-  version 1.7
+  Changed the final SMTP_AUTH constant to SMTP_AUTH_FINAL for consistency
+  with the response function.
+
+- pop3: Re-factored the final POP3_AUTH constant
   
-  Given that our first automake supported version is automake 1.7,
-  simply replacing AM_CONFIG_HEADER usage with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS seems
-  enough to yet support same automake versions.
+  Changed the final POP3_AUTH constant to POP3_AUTH_FINAL for consistency
+  with the response function.
+
+- imap: Re-factored final IMAP_AUTHENTICATE constant
   
-  Dave Reisner reported issue with 1.13 and provided patch.
+  Changed the final IMAP_AUTHENTICATE constant to IMAP_AUTHENTICATE_FINAL

-    that takes into account the id string.

+- docs: schannel and darwinssl documentation improvements
   
-  The gold standard for doing this correctly is pkg-config's own macro,
-  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG.  However, on the assumption that you have a good
-  reason not to use that directly (reduced dependencies for maintainer
-  builds?), the behaviour of cURL's version should at least match.
-  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG uses AC_PATH_TOOL, which ultimately ends up trying
-  ${host_alias}-pkg-config; this is not quite the same as what cURL does,
-  and may differ because ${host} has been run through config.sub.  For
-  instance, when cross-building to the armhf architecture on Ubuntu,
-  ${host_alias} is arm-linux-gnueabihf while ${host} is
-  arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.  This may also have been the cause of the
-  problem reported at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0224.html.
+  Schannel and darwinssl use the certificates built into the
+  OS to do vert verification instead of bundles. darwinssl
+  is thread-safe. Corrected typos in the NSS docs.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (18 Feb 2013)
+- resolver_error: remove wrong error message output
   
-  AC_PATH_TOOL is significantly simpler than cURL's current code, and
-  dates back to well before the current minimum of Autoconf 2.57, so let's
-  use it instead.
+  The attempt to use gai_strerror() or alternative function didn't work as
+  the 'sock_error' field didn't contain the proper error code. But since
+  this hasn't been reported and thus isn't really a big deal I decided to
+  just scrap the whole attempt to output the detailed resolver error and
+  instead remain with just stating that the resolving of the name failed.

-  Introducing a new persistent connection caching system using "bundles".

+
+- Curl_resolver_is_resolved: fix compiler warning
   
-  A bundle is a list of all persistent connections to the same host.
-  The connection cache consists of a hash of bundles, with the
-  hostname as the key.
-  The benefits may not be obvious, but they are two:
+  conversion to 'int' from 'long int' may alter its value
+
+- compiler warning fix
   
-  1) Faster search for connections to reuse, since the hash
-     lookup only finds connections to the host in question.
-  2) It lays out the groundworks for an upcoming patch,
-     which will introduce multiple HTTP pipelines.

+- compiler warning fix: declaration of 'wait' shadows a global declaration
   
-  This patch also removes the awkward list of "closure handles",
-  which were needed to send QUIT commands to the FTP server
-  when closing a connection.
-  Now we allocate a separate closure handle and use that
-  one to close all connections.
+  It seems older gcc installations (at least) will cause warnings if we
+  name a variable 'wait'. Now changed to 'block' instead.
   
-  This has been tested in a live system for a few weeks, and of
-  course passes the test suite.

-  preprocessor macros. Usage of these literals in libcurl's external
-  API was introduced in commit de24d7bd4c causing AIX build failures.
-  Appropriate inclusion of sys/poll.h by libcurl's external interface
-  fixes AIX build and usage issues while avoiding a SONAME bump.
+  As Curl_FormBoundary() is no longer used outside of this file (since
+  commit ad7291c1a9d), it is now renamed to formboundary() and is made
+  static.

-  It's against the spec and caused test failures when header

-  case bug #39 wasn't triggered.
+  Version 7.29.0 uses Makefiles generated with a newer version of the
+  autotools than the previous 7.28.1. These Makefiles try to install
+  e.g. header files by calling install-sh with multiple source files as
+  arguments. The bundled install-sh is to old and does not support this.
+  
+  The problem only occurs, if install-sh is actually being used, ie. the
+  platform install executable is to old or not usable. Example: Solaris
+  10.
+  
+  The files install-sh and mkinstalldirs are now updated with the automake
+  1.11.3 versions. A better fix might be to completely remove them from
+  git and force the files to be added/created during buildconf.

-  Digst: Add microseconds into nounce calculation
+  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message: fix buffer overflow
   
-  When using only 1 second precision, curl doesn't create new cnonce
-  values quickly enough for all uses.
+  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
+  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
+  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
+  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.
   
-  For example, issuing the following command multiple times to a recent
-  Tomcat causes authentication failures:
+  This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a
+  server that a libcurl based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or
+  IMAP. For applications that accept user provided URLs, it is also
+  thinkable that a malicious user would feed an application with a URL to
+  a server hosting code targetting this flaw.

-- [Oscar Koeroo brought this change]
+- [John E. Malmberg brought this change]
 
-  SSL: Several SSL-backend related fixes
+  VMS: fix and generate the VMS build config
   
-  axTLS:
+  config_h.com is a new file that generates a config.h file based on the
+  curl_config.h.in file and a quick scan of the configure script.  This is
+  actually a generic procedure that is shared with other VMS packages.
   
-  This will make the axTLS backend perform the RFC2818 checks, honoring
-  the VERIFYHOST setting similar to the OpenSSL backend.
+  The existing pre-built config-vms.h had over 100 entries that were not
+  correct and in some cases conflicted with the build options available in
+  the build_vms.com.
   
-  Generic for OpenSSL and axTLS:
+  generate_config_vms_h_curl.com is a helper procedure to the
+  config_h.com.  It covers the cases that the generic config_h.com is not
+  able to figure out, and accepts input from the build_vms.com procedure.
   
-  Move the hostcheck and cert_hostcheck functions from the lib/ssluse.c
-  files to make them genericly available for both the OpenSSL, axTLS and
-  other SSL backends. They are now in the new lib/hostcheck.c file.
+  build_curlbuild_h.com is a new file to generate the curlbuild.h file
+  that Curl is now using when it is using a curl_config.h file.
   
-  CyaSSL:
+  post-config-vms.h is a new file that is needed to provide VMS specific
+  definitions, and most of them need to be set before the system header
+  files are included.
   
-  CyaSSL now also has the RFC2818 checks enabled by default. There is a
-  limitation that the verifyhost can not be enabled exclusively on the
-  Subject CN field comparison. This SSL backend will thus behave like the
-  NSS and the GnuTLS (meaning: RFC2818 ok, or bust). In other words:
-  setting verifyhost to 0 or 1 will disable the Subject Alt Names checks
-  too.
+  The VMS build procedure is fixed:
   
-  Schannel:
+     1. Fixed to link in the correct HP ssl library.
+     2. Fixed to detect if HP Kerberos is installed.
+     3. Fixed to detect if HP LDAP is installed.
+     4. Fixed to detect if gnv$libzshr is installed.
+     5. Simplified the input parameter parsing to not use a loop.
+     6. Warn that 64 bit pointer option support is not complete
+        in comments.
+     7. Default to IEEE floating if platform supports it so
+        resulting libcurl will be compatible with other
+        open source projects on VMS.
+     8. Default to LARGEFILE if platform supports it.
+     9. Default to enable SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, libz
+        if the libraries are present.
+     10. Build with exact case global symbols for libcurl.
+     11. Generate linker option file needed.
+     12. Compiler list option only commonly needed items.
+     13. fulllist option for those who really want it.
+     14. Create debug symbol file on Alpha, IA64.
+
+- Curl_proxyCONNECT: return once CONNECT is sent
   
-  Updated the schannel information messages: Split the IP address usage
-  message from the verifyhost setting and changed the message about
-  disabling SNI (Server Name Indication, used in HTTP virtual hosting)
-  into a message stating that the Subject Alternative Names checks are
-  being disabled when verifyhost is set to 0 or 1. As a side effect of
-  switching off the RFC2818 related servername checks with
-  SCH_CRED_NO_SERVERNAME_CHECK
-  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa923430.aspx) the SNI feature
-  is being disabled. This effect is not documented in MSDN, but Wireshark
-  output clearly shows the effect (details on the libcurl maillist).
-  
-  PolarSSL:
-  
-  Fix the prototype change in PolarSSL of ssl_set_session() and the move
-  of the peer_cert from the ssl_context to the ssl_session. Found this
-  change in the PolarSSL SVN between r1316 and r1317 where the
-  POLARSSL_VERSION_NUMBER was at 0x01010100. But to accommodate the Ubuntu
-  PolarSSL version 1.1.4 the check is to discriminate between lower then
-  PolarSSL version 1.2.0 and 1.2.0 and higher. Note: The PolarSSL SVN
-  trunk jumped from version 1.1.1 to 1.2.0.
+  By doing this unconditionally, we infer a simpler and more defined
+  behavior. This also has the upside that test 1021 no longer fails for me
+  even if I run with valgrind.
   
-  Generic:
+  Also fixed some wrong comments.
+
+Steve Holme (5 Feb 2013)
+- email: Reworked comments in the endofresp() functions
   
-  All the SSL backends are fixed and checked to work with the
-  ssl.verifyhost as a boolean, which is an internal API change.
+  Tidied up the comments in the endofresp() functions to be more
+  meaningful prior to release.
 
-- libcurl: VERSIONINFO update
+Marc Hoersken (5 Feb 2013)
+- schannel: Removed extended error connection setup flag
   
-  Since we added the curl_multi_wait function, the VERSIONINFO needed
-  updating.
+  According KB975858 this flag may cause problems on Windows 7 and
+  Windows Server 2008 R2 systems. Extended error information is not
+  currently used by libcurl and therefore not a requirement.
   
-  Reported by: Patrick Monnerat
-

+  supported challenge-response based SASL authentication mechanism, such

-  The commit made test 2024 work but caused a regression with repeated

-- CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST: stop supporting the 1 value
+- pop3: Fixed no known authentication mechanism when fallback is required
   
-  After a research team wrote a document[1] that found several live source
-  codes out there in the wild that misused the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
-  option thinking it was a boolean, this change now bans 1 as a value and
-  will make libcurl return error for it.
+  Fixed an issue where (lib)curl is compiled without support for a

+
+Daniel Stenberg (1 Feb 2013)
+- singleipconnect: simplify and clean up
   
-  1 was never supported by all SSL backends in libcurl, so this cleanup
-  makes the treatment of it unified.
+  Remove timeout argument that's never used.
   
-  The report's list of mistakes for this option were all PHP code and
-  while there's a binding layer between libcurl and PHP, the PHP team has
-  decided that they have an as thin layer as possible on top of libcurl so
-  they will not alter or specifically filter a 'TRUE' value for this
-  particular option. I sympathize with that position.
+  Make the actual connection get detected on a single spot to reduce code
+  duplication.

-- FTP: prevent the multi interface from blocking
+  darwinssl: Fix bug where packets were sometimes transmitted twice
   
-  As pointed out in Bug report #3579064, curl_multi_perform() would
-  wrongly use a blocking mechanism internally for some commands which
-  could lead to for example a very long block if the LIST response never
-  showed.
+  There was a bug where, if SSLWrite() returned errSSLWouldBlock but did
+  succeed in transmitting at least something, then we'd incorrectly
+  resend the packet. Now we never take errSSLWouldBlock as a sign that
+  nothing was transferred to/from the server.
   
-  The solution was to make sure to properly continue to use the multi
-  interface non-blocking state machine.
-  
-  The new test 1501 verifies the fix.

+- smtp.c: Fixed failure detection during TLS upgrade
   
-  This is a minor change in behavior after having been pointed out by Mark
-  Tully and discussed on the list. Initially this case would internally
-  call poll() with no sockets and a timeout which would equal a sleep for
-  that specified time.
+  smtp_state_upgrade_tls() would attempt to incorrectly complete the
+  upgrade to smtps and start the EHLO command if
+  Curl_ssl_connect_nonblocking() returned a failure code and if ssldone
+  was set to TRUE. This would only happen when a non-blocking API hadn't
+  been provided by the SSL implementation and curlssl_connect() was
+  called underneath.

+- configure: use XC_CONFIGURE_PREAMBLE early checks
   
-  Do not fill the decrypted data buffer with more data unless
-  required in order to return the requested amount of data.
+  Some basic checks we make were placed early enough in generated
+  configure script when using autoconf 2.5X versions. Newer autoconf
+  versions expand these checks much further into the configure script,
+  rendering them useless. Using XC_CONFIGURE_PREAMBLE fixes placement
+  of early intended checks across all our autoconf supported versions.
 
-- curl_schannel: Removed buffer limit and optimized buffer strategy
-  
-  Since there are servers that seem to return very big encrypted
-  data packages, we need to be able to handle those without having
-  an internal size limit. To avoid the buffer growing to fast to
-  early the initial size was decreased and the minimum free space

-  tool_metalink.c: Filtered resource URLs by type
+  When running a configure script that has nested packages (for example
+  libcurl's configure with --enable-ares and c-ares sources embedded in
+  curl tree) and AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([nested-subdir]) machinery is used to
+  automatically run the nested configure script from within the parent
+  configure script, it happens that the nested _shell_ script will
+  inherit shell variables exported from the parent _shell_ script.
   
-  In Metalink v3, the type attribute of url element indicates the
-  type of the resource the URL points to. It can include URL to the
-  meta data, such as BitTorrent metainfo file.  In Curl, we are not
-  interested in these meta data URLs. Instead, we are only
-  interested in the HTTP and FTP URLs. This change filters out
-  non-HTTP and FTP URLs. If we don't filter out them, it will be
-  downloaded by curl and hash check will fail if hash is provided
-  and next URL will be tried. This change will cut this useless
-  network transfer.

-- https.c example: remember to call curl_global_init()
+  If for example parent configure script sets and exports LDFLAGS and LIBS
+  variables with proper values in order to link either a parent library or
+  program with a library which will be configured and built by a nested
+  package; It will happen that when the nested configure script runs, the
+  nested library does not exist yet and _any_ link-test done in the nested
+  configure will fail, such as those that autoconf macros perform in order
+  to detect existing compiler and its characteristics, the result is that
+  the nested configure script will fail with errors such as:
   
-  ... in order not to leak memory on initializing an SSL library.

-  The Curl_reconnect_request() function could end up returning a pointer

-  unconditionally after Curl_done() avoids this risk.
+  On the other hand, AC_SUBST'ing them is appropriate and even with nested
+  packages each package's config.status gets its own package values.

-  Since Windows/MinGW threat 0x1A as the EOF character, reading binary
-  files which contain that byte does not work using text mode.
-  The read function will only read until the first 0x1A byte. This

-  builds, this change adds build support to winbuild makefiles.
-
-- winbuild: Adjusted order of options to generated config name
+  NSS caches certs/keys returned by the SSL_GetClientAuthDataHook callback
+  and if we connect second time to the same server, the cached cert/key
+  pair is used.  If we use multiple client certificates for different
+  paths on the same server, we need to clear the session cache to force
+  NSS to call the hook again.  The commit 052a08ff prevented the session
+  cache from being cleared if a client certificate from file was used.
   
-  Cleaned up order of handled build options by ordering them
-  nearly alphabetically by using the order of the generated
-  config name. Preparation for future/more build options.
+  The condition is now fixed to cover both cases: consssl->client_nickname
+  is not NULL if a client certificate from the NSS database is used and
+  connssl->obj_clicert is not NULL if a client certificate from file is
+  used.

-  Bug: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=685402
-
-- FILEFORMAT: the FTP commands work for more protocols
+  2 - Due to the circular interdependency of old lib/setup_once.h and the
+      c-ares setup_once.h header, old file lib/setup_once.h has carried
+      back from 2006 up to now days an alarming and prominent notice about
+      the need of keeping libcurl's and c-ares's setup_once.h in sync.
+  
+      Given that this commit fixes the circular interdependency, the need
+      and presence of mentioned notice is removed.
+  
+      All mentioned interdependencies come back from now old days when
+      the c-ares project lived inside a curl subdirectory. This commit
+      removes last traces of such fact.

+  1. When the downloaded data file from Mozilla is current, but the output

-- TODO-RELEASE: the (nil) bug is fixed
-
-- add_next_timeout: minor restructure of code
+  2. added -f option to force re-processing the file.  Useful for
+  debugging/testing the process.
   
-  By reading the ->head pointer and using that instead of the ->size
-  number to figure out if there's a list remaining we avoid the (false
-  positive) clang-analyzer warning that we might dereference of a null
-  pointer.
-
-- verbose messages: fixed output of hostnames in re-used connections
+  3. added support for output to '-' (stdout), allowing the output to be
+  piped.
   
-  I suspect this is a regression introduced in commit 207cf150, included
-  since 7.24.0.
+  4. All progress and error messages go to STDERR rather than STDOUT (3)
   
-  Avoid showing '(nil)' as hostname in verbose output by making sure the
-  hostname fixup function is called early enough to set the pointers that
-  are used for this. The name data is set again for each request even for
-  re-used connections to handle multiple hostnames over the same
-  connection (like with proxy) or that the casing etc of the host name is
-  changed between requests (which has proven to be important at least once
-  in the past).
+  5. The script opened and closed the output file many times
+  unnecessarily.  It now opens it once, does the output and closes it.
   
-  Test1011 was modified to use a redirect with a re-used a connection
-  since it then showed the bug and now lo longer does. There's currently
-  no easy way to have the test suite detect 'nil' texts in verbose ouputs
-  so no tests will detect if this problem gets reintroduced.
+  6. Backup of the input files happens after successful processing, not
+  before.

-- [Maxime Larocque brought this change]
-
-  Curl_socket_check: fix return code for timeout
-  
-  We found a problem with ftp transfer using libcurl (7.23 and 7.25)
-  inside an application which is receiving unix signals (SIGUSR1,
-  SIGUSR2...) almost continuously. (Linux 2.4, PowerPC, HAVE_POLL_FINE
-  defined).
-  
-  Curl_socket_check() uses poll() to wait for the socket, and retries it
-  when a signal is received (EINTR). However, if a signal is received and
-  it also happens that the timeout has been reached, Curl_socket_check()
-  returns -1 instead of 0 (indicating an error instead of a timeout).
-  
-  In our case, the result is an aborted connection even before the ftp
-  banner is received from the server, and a return value of
-  CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY from curl_easy_perform() (Curl_pp_multi_statemach(),
-  in pingpong.c, actually returns OOM if Curl_socket_check() fails :-)
-  Funny to debug on a system on which OOM is a possible cause).

-  won't continue reading until after poll is called again.
-
-- Change return values of get_request, accept_connection and service_connection to add a return code
-  for non-blocking sockets: now -1 means error or connection finished, 1 means data was read, and 0
-  means there is no data available now so need to wait for poll (new return value)
-
-- Hoist the loop out of get_request, and make sure that it can be reentered when a request is
-  half-finished.
-  
-  Note the the req struct used to be re-initialized AFTER reading pipeline data, so now that we
-  initialize it from the caller we must be careful not to overwrite the pipeline data.
-  
-  Also we now need to handle the case where the buffer is already full when get_request is called -
-  previously this never happened as it was always called with an empty buffer and looped until done.
-  
-  Now get_request is called in a loop, so the next step is to run the loop on a socket only when poll

+- build: rename 93 lib/*.c files
   
-  Discussion on the list: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-07/0271.html

-- TODO: Updated after 7.27.0 release
+  93 lib/*.c source files renamed to use our standard naming scheme.
   
-  Removed APOP and SASL authentication from the POP3 section and metalink
-  support from the client section as these features were implemented in
-  this release.
+  This commit only does the file renaming.
   
-  Moved adding gssapi to SASL into it's own section rather than repeat it
-  for each protocol.

-  This needs another look from the configure experts. I tested that
-  it works so far with MinGW64 cross-compiler; libcurl builds and
-  links fine, but curl not yet ...

-- RELEASE-NOTES: remove mentioned of bug never in a release
+- build: make use of 93 lib/*.c renamed files
   
-  The --silent bug came with 7561a0fc834c435 which was never in a release.
-  Pointed out by Kamil Dudka
-
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 33b815e894fb
+  93 *.c source files renamed to use our standard naming scheme.
   
-  4 more bugfixes, 3 more contributors
+  This change affects 77 files in libcurl's source tree.

-- Changed Windows IDN text to 'WinIDN'.
+Daniel Stenberg (3 Jan 2013)
+- INSTALL: unify the SSL library texts
   
-  Synced the output to the same short form as we now use for
-  Windows SSL (WinSSL).
+  Make them smaller and more similar for each separate SSL library
+  supported by the configure build

+- curl_setup.h: remove redundant include guard
 
-  darwinssl: fixed freeze involving the multi interface
+- build and tests: curl_10char_object_name() shell function
   
-  Previously the curl_multi interface would freeze if darwinssl was
-  enabled and at least one of the handles tried to connect to a Web site
-  using HTTPS. Removed the "wouldblock" state darwinssl was using because
-  I figured out a solution for our "would block but in which direction?"
-  dilemma.

-Guenter Knauf (25 Jul 2012)
-- Added support for tls-srp to MinGW builds.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (24 Jul 2012)
-- curl_easy_setopt: fix typo
+  lib/objnames.inc provides definition of curl_10char_object_name() shell
+  function. The intended purpose of this function is to transliterate a
+  (*.c) source file name that may be longer than 10 characters, or not,
+  into a string with at most 10 characters which may be used as an OS/400
+  object name.
   
-  Reported by: Santhana Todatry
-
-- keepalive: multiply value for OS-specific units
+  Test case 1221 does unit testng of this function and also verifies
+  that it is possible to generate distinct short object names for all
+  curl and libcurl *.c source file names.
   
-  DragonFly uses milliseconds, while our API and Linux use full seconds.
+  lib/objnames-test.sh is the shell script used for test case 1221.

-- http: print reason phrase from HTTP status line on error

-- tool_operate: fix misplaced initialization of orig_noprogress
+- configure.ac: replace AM_CONFIG_HEADER with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS
   
-  ... and orig_isatty which caused --silent to be entirely ignored in case
-  the standard output was redirected to a file!

-Daniel Stenberg (21 Jul 2012)

-  Client's "qop" value should not be quoted (RFC2617, section 3.2.2).

-- Fixed typo.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (20 Jul 2012)
-- make: make distclean work again
+  automake 1.13 errors if AM_CONFIG_HEADER is used in configure script.
+  automake 1.13 no longer autoupdates AM_CONFIG_HEADER to
+  AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, thing which automake has been doing since automake
+  version 1.7
   
-  The clean-local hook needed some polish to make sure make distclean
-  works. Added comment describing why.
-
-- test Makefile: only feature 'unit' once in the list of dirs

-Dan Fandrich (20 Jul 2012)
-- Fixed some typos in documentation
-
-Guenter Knauf (20 Jul 2012)
-- Fixed CR issue with Win32 version on MSYS.
+  Given that our first automake supported version is automake 1.7,
+  simply replacing AM_CONFIG_HEADER usage with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS seems
+  enough to yet support same automake versions.
   
-  Previous fix didnt work on Linux ...
-
-- Fixed CR issue with Win32 version on MSYS.
-
-- Fixed MSYS <-> Windows path convertion.
+  Dave Reisner reported issue with 1.13 and provided patch.
   
-  Replaced the Windows real path from mount hack with a more
-  reliable and simpler hack: the MSYS shell has a builtin pwd
-  which understands a -W option which does convertion to Windows
-  paths. Tested and confirmed that this works on all MSYS versions
-  I have back to a 3 year old one.
+  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-12/0246.html
 
-- Follow-up fix to detect SSL libs with MinGW.
+- curl-override.m4: provide AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR definition conditionally
   
-  1) the check for winssl needs to come before nss check
-  2) the SSL checks must begin with a new if or else we will
-  never find any SSL lib with MinGW.
-
-- Tell git to not convert configure-related files.
+  Provide a 'traceable' AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR definition only when using
+  an autoconf version that does not provide it, instead of what we were
+  doing up to now of providing and overriding AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR for
+  all autoconf versions.
 
-- Trial to teach runtests.pl about WinSSL.
+Steve Holme (30 Dec 2012)
+- imap.c: Minor follow up tidy up
 
-- Fixed warning 'uninitialized value in numeric gt'.
+- imap: Code tidy up prior to adding support for the CAPABILITY command
   
-  This is a MSYS/MinGW-only warning; full warning text is:
-  Use of uninitialized value in numeric gt (>) at ../../curl/tests/runtests.pl line 2227.
+  * Changing the order of the state machine to represent the order in
+    which commands are sent to the server.
+  
+  * Reworking the imap_endofresp() function as the FETCH response doesn't
+    include the command id and shouldn't be part of the length comparison
+    that takes into account the id string.

-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 9d11716933616
+- pop3_doing: Applied debug info message when function fails
   
-  Fixed 6 bugs, added 3 contributors
+  Applied the same debug message as used in smtp_doing() and imap_doing()
+  when pop3_multi_statemach() fails.
 
-- multi_runsingle: added precaution against easy_conn NULL pointer
+- imap_doing: don't call imap_dophase_done() if already failed
   
-  In many states the easy_conn pointer is referenced and just assumed to
-  be working. This is an added extra check since analyzing indicates
-  there's a risk we can end up in these states with a NULL pointer there.
+  Applied the POP3 fix from commit 2897ce7dc2e1 so imap_dophase_done()
+  isn't called if imap_multi_statemach() fails.
 
-- getparam: fix the GetStr() macro
+- smtp_doing: don't call smtp_dophase_done() if already failed
   
-  It should return PARAM_NO_MEM if the strdup fails. Spotted by
-  clang-analyzer
+  Applied the POP3 fix from commit 2897ce7dc2e1 so smtp_dophase_done()
+  isn't called if smtp_multi_statemach() fails.

-- parse_proxy: remove dead assignment
+Steve Holme (29 Dec 2012)
+- pop3.c: Removed unnecessary POP3_STOP state changes
   
-  Spotted by clang-analyzer
+  Removed unnecessary state changes in pop3_state_starttls_resp()
+  following previous fix in IMAP module.
 
-- ftp_do_more: add missing check of return code
+- smtp.c: Added extra comments around SMTP_STOP state change
   
-  Spotted by clang-analyzer. The return code was never checked, just
-  stored.
+  Provided extra comments in the SMTP module following previous IMAP fix.
 
-- getinfo: use va_end and cut off Curl_ from static funcs
+- imap.c: Fixed bad state error when logging in with invalid credentials
   
-  va_end() needs to be used after va_start() and we don't normally use
-  Curl_ prefixes for purely static functions.
-
-- [Philip Craig brought this change]
+  Fixed a problem with the state machine when attempting to log in with
+  invalid credentials. The server would report login failure but libcurl
+  would not read the response due to inappropriate IMAP_STOP states being
+  set after the login was sent.
 
-  Split up Curl_getinfo
-  
-  This avoids false positives from clang's scan-build.
+Yang Tse (29 Dec 2012)
+- imap.c: remove trailing whitespace

+- imap.c: Code tidy up - Part 2

+- imap.c: Code tidy up - Part 1
+  
+  Applied some of the comment and layout changes that had already been
+  applied to the pop3 and smtp code over the last 6 to 9 months.
+  
+  This is in preparation of adding SASL based authentication.
 
-- Minor fixes to MinGW makefiles.
+- pop3.c: Minor code tidy up

-- Added curl_global_* functions.
+- curl_imap.h: Tidy up of comments to be more readable
 
-Daniel Stenberg (12 Jul 2012)
-- tests: verify the stricter numeric option parser
+- imap.c: Code tidy up renaming imapsendf() to imap_sendf()
   
-  Test 1409 and 1410 verifies the stricter numeric option parser
-  introduced the other day in commit f2b6ebed7b.
+  Renamed imapsendf() to imap_sendf() to be more in keeping with the
+  other imap functions as well as Curl_pp_sendf() that it replaces.
 
-- SWS: use of uninitialized memory fix
+Yang Tse (28 Dec 2012)
+- build: rename 76 lib/*.h files
   
-  I made "connmon" not get initialized properly before use, and I use the
-  big hammer and make sure we always clear the entire struct to avoid any
-  problem like this in the future.
-
-- test48: verify that HEAD doesn't close extra
+  76 private header files renamed to use our standard naming scheme.
   
-  Two commits ago, we fixed a bug where the connction would be closed
-  prematurely after a HEAD. Now I added connection-monitor to test 48 and
-  added a second HEAD and make sure that both are sent over the same
-  connection.
+  This commit only does the file renaming.
   
-  This triggered a failure before the bug fix and now works. Will help us
-  avoid a future regression of this kind.
-
-- connection-monitor: always log disconnect when enabled
+  ----------------------------------------
   
-  This makes verifying easier and makes us more sure curl closes the
-  connection only at the correct point in time. Adjusted test 206 and 1008
-  accordingly and updated the docs for it.

-- HEAD: don't force-close after response-headers
+- build: make use of 76 lib/*.h renamed files
   
-  A HEAD response has no body length and gets the headers like the

-  based on the same rules. This mistake caused connections that did HEAD
-  to get closed too often without a valid reason.

-- http-proxy: keep CONNECT connections alive (for NTLM)
+  darwinssl: Fix implicit conversion compiler warnings
   
-  When doing CONNECT requests, libcurl must make sure the connection is

-  other cases as well.
+  The Clang compiler found a few implicit conversion problems that have
+  now been fixed.
+
+Yang Tse (14 Dec 2012)
+- setup_once.h: HP-UX <sys/socket.h> issue workaround
   
-  NTLM over CONNECT requests has been broken since this regression I
-  introduced in my CONNECT cleanup commits that started with 41b02378342,
-  included since 7.25.0.
+  Issue: When building a 32bit target with large file support HP-UX
+  <sys/socket.h> header file may simultaneously provide two different
+  sets of declarations for sendfile and sendpath functions, one with
+  static and another with external linkage. Given that we do not use
+  mentioned functions we really don't care which linkage is the
+  appropriate one, but on the other hand, the double declaration emmits
+  warnings when using the HP-UX compiler and errors when using modern
+  gcc versions resulting in fatal compilation errors.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3538625

+  configure: fix cross pkg-config detection
+  
+  When cross-compiling, CURL_CHECK_PKGCONFIG was checking for the cross
+  pkg-config using ${host}-pkg-config.
+  
+  The gold standard for doing this correctly is pkg-config's own macro,
+  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG.  However, on the assumption that you have a good
+  reason not to use that directly (reduced dependencies for maintainer
+  builds?), the behaviour of cURL's version should at least match.
+  PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG uses AC_PATH_TOOL, which ultimately ends up trying
+  ${host_alias}-pkg-config; this is not quite the same as what cURL does,
+  and may differ because ${host} has been run through config.sub.  For
+  instance, when cross-building to the armhf architecture on Ubuntu,
+  ${host_alias} is arm-linux-gnueabihf while ${host} is
+  arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.  This may also have been the cause of the
+  problem reported at http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0224.html.
+  
+  AC_PATH_TOOL is significantly simpler than cURL's current code, and
+  dates back to well before the current minimum of Autoconf 2.57, so let's
+  use it instead.

-- Added files generated by mingw32, eclipse and VC.
+  Introducing a new persistent connection caching system using "bundles".
+  
+  A bundle is a list of all persistent connections to the same host.
+  The connection cache consists of a hash of bundles, with the
+  hostname as the key.
+  The benefits may not be obvious, but they are two:
+  
+  1) Faster search for connections to reuse, since the hash
+     lookup only finds connections to the host in question.
+  2) It lays out the groundworks for an upcoming patch,
+     which will introduce multiple HTTP pipelines.
   
-  Posted by Marc Hoersken.
+  This patch also removes the awkward list of "closure handles",
+  which were needed to send QUIT commands to the FTP server
+  when closing a connection.
+  Now we allocate a separate closure handle and use that
+  one to close all connections.
+  
+  This has been tested in a live system for a few weeks, and of
+  course passes the test suite.

-  curl: Made --metalink option toggle Metalink functionality

-  In this change, --metalink option no longer takes argument.  If

-  If given URIs are remote (e.g., http URI), curl downloads it
-  first. Regardless URI is local file (e.g., file URI scheme) or
-  remote, Metalink XML file is not written to local file system and
-  the received data is fed into Metalink XML parser directly.  This
-  means with --metalink option, filename related options like -O
-  and -o are ignored.
+  Consistently use CRLF instead. The mixed endings weren't
+  documented so I assume they were unintentional.
   
-  Usage examples:
+  This change doesn't matter for curl itself but makes using
+  the tests with a proxy between curl and the test server
+  more convenient.
   
-  $ curl --metalink http://example.org/foo.metalink

-  schannel SSL: Use standard Curl read/write methods
+  Digst: Add microseconds into nounce calculation
+  
+  When using only 1 second precision, curl doesn't create new cnonce
+  values quickly enough for all uses.
+  
+  For example, issuing the following command multiple times to a recent
+  Tomcat causes authentication failures:
+  
+  curl --digest -utest:test http://tomcat.test.com:8080/manager/list
+  
+  This is because curl uses the same cnonce for several seconds, but
+  doesn't increment the nonce counter.  Tomcat correctly interprets
+  this as a replay attack and rejects the request.
   
-  Replaced calls to swrite with Curl_write_plain and calls to sread
-  with Curl_read_plain.
+  When microsecond-precision is available, this commit causes curl to
+  change cnonce values much more frequently.

-
-  SSPI related code: Unicode support for WinCE
+  Generic for OpenSSL and axTLS:
   
-  SSPI related code now compiles with ANSI and WCHAR versions of security
-  methods (WinCE requires WCHAR versions of methods).
+  Move the hostcheck and cert_hostcheck functions from the lib/ssluse.c
+  files to make them genericly available for both the OpenSSL, axTLS and
+  other SSL backends. They are now in the new lib/hostcheck.c file.
   
-  Pulled UTF8 to WCHAR conversion methods out of idn_win32.c into their own file.
+  CyaSSL:
   
-  curl_sasl.c - include curl_memory.h to use correct memory functions.
+  CyaSSL now also has the RFC2818 checks enabled by default. There is a
+  limitation that the verifyhost can not be enabled exclusively on the
+  Subject CN field comparison. This SSL backend will thus behave like the
+  NSS and the GnuTLS (meaning: RFC2818 ok, or bust). In other words:
+  setting verifyhost to 0 or 1 will disable the Subject Alt Names checks
+  too.

-  Makefile.vc was not updated and the configuration name which is
-  used in the build path did not match between both build files.

+  POLARSSL_VERSION_NUMBER was at 0x01010100. But to accommodate the Ubuntu
+  PolarSSL version 1.1.4 the check is to discriminate between lower then
+  PolarSSL version 1.2.0 and 1.2.0 and higher. Note: The PolarSSL SVN
+  trunk jumped from version 1.1.1 to 1.2.0.
   
-  This patch fixes those issues and introduces the following changes:

-  - Added ENABLE_WINSSL option to winbuild/Makefile.vc (default yes)
-  - Changed winbuild/MakefileBuild.vc to set USE_WINSSL to true if

-  - Separated WINSSL handling from SSPI handling to be consistent with
-  the other options and their corresponding code path

-  urldata.h: fix cyassl/openssl/ssl.h build clash with wincrypt.h
+- http_perhapsrewind: consider NTLM over proxy too
   
-  Building with CyaSSL failed compilation. Reason being that OCSP_REQUEST and
-  OCSP_RESPONSE are enum values in CyaSSL and defines in <wincrypt.h> included
-  via <winldap.h> in ldap.c.
+  The logic previously checked for a started NTLM negotiation only for
+  host and not also with proxy, leading to problems doing POSTs over a
+  proxy NTLM that are larger than 2000 bytes. Now it includes proxy in the
+  check.

+- test1413: verify redirects to URLs with fragments

+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3581898
 
-- configure: new option --with-winssl
+- URL parser: cut off '#' fragments from URLs (better)
   
-  This option may be used to build curl/libcurl using SSL/TLS support provided
-  by MS windows system libraries. Option is mutually exclusive with any other
-  SSL library. Default value is --without-winssl.
+  The existing logic only cut off the fragment from the separate 'path'
+  buffer which is used when sending HTTP to hosts. The buffer that held
+  the full URL used for proxies were not dealt with. It is now.
   
-  --with-winssl option implies --with-sspi option.
+  Test case 5 was updated to use a fragment on a URL over a proxy.
   
-  Option meaningful only for Windows builds.

+- curl: set CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST to 0 to disable
+
+- test 2027/2030: take duplicate Digest requests into account
   
-  Version number is removed in order to make this info consistent with
-  how we do it with other MS and Linux system libraries for which we don't
-  provide this info.
+  With the reversion of ce8311c7e49eca and the new clear logic, this flaw
+  is present and we allow it.
+
+- Curl_pretransfer: clear out unwanted auth methods
   
-  Identifier changed from 'WinSSPI' to 'schannel' given that this is the
-  actual provider of the SSL/TLS support. libcurl can still be built with
-  SSPI and without SCHANNEL support.
+  As a handle can be re-used after having done HTTP auth in a previous
+  request, it must make sure to clear out the HTTP types that aren't
+  wanted in this new request.

-  This reverts commit 9c94236e6cc078a0dc5a78b6e2fefc1403e5375e.
+  After a research team wrote a document[1] that found several live source
+  codes out there in the wild that misused the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
+  option thinking it was a boolean, this change now bans 1 as a value and
+  will make libcurl return error for it.
   
-  It didn't server its purpose, so lets go back to long-time working code.

-- socks_sspi.c: further cleanup
-
-- [Marc Hoersken brought this change]
-
-  socks_sspi.c: Clean up and removal of obsolete minor status
+  1 was never a sensible value to use in production but was introduced
+  back in the days to help debugging. It was always documented clearly
+  this way.
   
-  Removed obsolete minor status variable and parameter of status function
-  which was never used or set at all. Also Curl_sspi_strerror does support
-  only one status and there is no need for a second sub status.
-
-Guenter Knauf (12 Jun 2012)
-- Removed trailing whitespaces.
+  1 was never supported by all SSL backends in libcurl, so this cleanup
+  makes the treatment of it unified.
+  
+  The report's list of mistakes for this option were all PHP code and
+  while there's a binding layer between libcurl and PHP, the PHP team has
+  decided that they have an as thin layer as possible on top of libcurl so
+  they will not alter or specifically filter a 'TRUE' value for this
+  particular option. I sympathize with that position.

-  version: Replaced SSPI feature information with version string details
+Daniel Stenberg (1 Nov 2012)
+- BUGS: fix the bug tracker URL
   
-  Added Windows SSPI version information to the curl version string when
-  SCHANNEL SSL is not enabled, as the version of the library should also
-  be included when SSPI is used to generate security contexts.
+  The URL we used before is the one that goes directly to 'add' a bug
+  report, but since you can only do that after first having logged in to
+  sourceforge, the link often doesn't work for visitors.
   
-  Removed SSPI from the feature list as the features are GSS-Negotiate,
-  NTLM and SSL depending on the usage of the SSPI library.

-  The hex value was printed as signed 64-bit value on 64-bit systems:

-  
-  curl_sspi.c: Fallback to security function table version number
-  Instead of reporting an unknown version, the interface version is used.

-  schannel: Added special shutdown check for Windows 2000 Professional
+- curl_multi_wait: no wait if no descriptors to wait for
   
-  Windows 2000 Professional:  Schannel returns SEC_E_OK instead
-  of SEC_I_CONTEXT_EXPIRED. If the length of the output buffer
-  is zero and the first byte of the encrypted packet is 0x15,
-  the application can safely assume that the message was a
-  close_notify message and change the return value to
-  SEC_I_CONTEXT_EXPIRED.
-  
-  Connection shutdown does not mean that there is no data to read
-  Correctly handle incomplete message and ask curl to re-read
-  Fixed buffer for decrypted being to small
-  Re-structured read condition to be more effective
-  Removed obsolete verbose messages
-  Changed memory reduction method to keep a minimum buffer of size 4096

+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 971f5bcedd418
   
-  Fixed warning: dereferencing pointer does break strict-aliasing rules
-  by using a union instead of separate pointer variables.
-  Internal union sockaddr_u could probably be moved to generic header.
-  Thanks to Paul Howarth for the hint about using unions for this.
-  
-  Important for winbuild: Separate declaration of sockaddr_u pointer.
-  The pointer variable *sock cannot be declared and initialized right
-  after the union declaration. Therefore it has to be a separate statement.

-
-- pop3: Fixed an issue with changes introduced in commit c267c53017bc
+  Each certificate section of the input certdata.txt file has a trust
+  section following it with details.
   
-  Because pop3_endofresp() is called for each line of data yet is not
-  passed the line and line length, so we have to use the data pointed to
-  by pp->linestart_resp which contains the whole packet, the mechanisms
-  were being detected in one call yet the function would be called for
-  each line of data.
+  This script failed to detect the start of the trust for at least one
+  cert[*], which made the script continue pass that section into the next
+  one where it found an 'untrusted' marker and as a result that certficate
+  was not included in the output.
   
-  Using curl with verbose mode enabled would show that one line of data
-  would be received in response to the AUTH command, before the AUTH
-  <mechanism> command was sent to the server and then the next few lines
-  of the original AUTH command would be displayed before the response from
-  the AUTH <mechanism> command. This would then cause problems when
-  parsing the CRAM-MD5 challenge data as extra data was contained in the
-  buffer.
+  [*] = "Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions RootCA 2011"
   
-  Changed the parsing so that each line is checked for the mechanisms
-  and the function returns FALSE until the whole of the AUTH response has
-  been processed.

-  This wasn't a problem prior to the 7.26.0 release but with the
-  introduction of custom commands the user and/or application developer
-  might want to issue a CAPA command without having to log in as a

-  using the CAPA command which will return SASL and the list of mechanisms
-  if supported, not include SASL if SASL authentication is not supported
-  or -ERR if the CAPA command is not supported. As such it seems simpler
-  to use the AUTH command and fallback to normal clear text authentication
-  if the the command is not supported.
+  "Currently you can only share DNS and/or COOKIE data" is incorrect since

-  Check checksum of downloaded file if checksum is available
-  
-  Metalink file contains several hash types of checksums, such as
-  md5, sha-1, sha-256, etc. To deal with these checksums, I created
-  abstraction layer based on lib/curl_md5.h and
-  lib/md5.c. Basically, they are almost the same but I changed the
-  code so that it is not hash type dependent. Currently,
-  GNUTLS(nettle or gcrypt) and OpenSSL functions are supported.
-  
-  Checksum checking is done by reopening download file.  If there
-  is an I/O error, the current implementation just prints error
-  message and does not try next resource.
+  ftp: active conn, place calling sockopt callback at the end of function
   
-  In this patch, the supported hash types are: md5, sha-1 and sha-256.
+  Commit b91d29a28e170c16d65d956db79f2cd3a82372d2 introduces a bug and breaks Curl_closesocket function. sock_accepted flag for the second socket should be tagged as TRUE before the sockopt callback is called because in case the callback returns an error, Curl_closesocket function is going to call the - fclosesocket - callback for the accept()ed socket

+  For active FTP connections, applications may need setting the sockopt after accept() call returns successful. This fix gives a call to the callback registered with CURL_SOCKOPTFUNCTION option.

-- DOCS: Fixed meaning of bit 2 in CURLOPT_POSTREDIR
+- verbose messages: fixed output of hostnames in re-used connections
   
-  Setting bit 2 for this value was documented as having a constant value
-  defined as CURL_REDIR_POST_303 yet referenced a 302 request.
+  I suspect this is a regression introduced in commit 207cf150, included
+  since 7.24.0.
   
-  Additionally corrected the meaning of CURL_REDIR_POST_ALL for all three
-  bits and fixed problems with the bolding of keywords in this section.
-
-- DOCS: Standardised how RFCs are referenced.
+  Avoid showing '(nil)' as hostname in verbose output by making sure the
+  hostname fixup function is called early enough to set the pointers that
+  are used for this. The name data is set again for each request even for
+  re-used connections to handle multiple hostnames over the same
+  connection (like with proxy) or that the casing etc of the host name is
+  changed between requests (which has proven to be important at least once
+  in the past).
+  
+  Test1011 was modified to use a redirect with a re-used a connection
+  since it then showed the bug and now lo longer does. There's currently
+  no easy way to have the test suite detect 'nil' texts in verbose ouputs
+  so no tests will detect if this problem gets reintroduced.
   
-  Standardised how RFCs are referenced so that the website may autolink to
-  the correct documentation on ietf.org. Additionally removed the one link
-  to RFC3986 on curl.haxx.se.

-- smtp: Fixed an issue with the multi-interface always sending postdata
+  We found a problem with ftp transfer using libcurl (7.23 and 7.25)
+  inside an application which is receiving unix signals (SIGUSR1,
+  SIGUSR2...) almost continuously. (Linux 2.4, PowerPC, HAVE_POLL_FINE
+  defined).
   
-  Due to the result code being reset to CURLE_OK when smtp_dophase_done()
-  was called, postdata would incorrectly be sent to the server when the
-  MAIL FROM or RCPT command was rejected.
+  Curl_socket_check() uses poll() to wait for the socket, and retries it
+  when a signal is received (EINTR). However, if a signal is received and
+  it also happens that the timeout has been reached, Curl_socket_check()
+  returns -1 instead of 0 (indicating an error instead of a timeout).
   
-  As such, libcurl would return the wrong result code from performing the
-  operation and additionally set CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE to be that
-  returned by the postdata command.
+  In our case, the result is an aborted connection even before the ftp
+  banner is received from the server, and a return value of
+  CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY from curl_easy_perform() (Curl_pp_multi_statemach(),
+  in pingpong.c, actually returns OOM if Curl_socket_check() fails :-)
+  Funny to debug on a system on which OOM is a possible cause).

-  Fixed compile error with GNUTLS+NETTLE
+- WSAPoll: disabled on all windows builds
   
-  In nettle/md5.h, md5_init and md5_update are defined as macros to
-  nettle_md5_init and nettle_md5_update respectively.  This causes
-  error when using MD5_params.md5_init and md5_update.  This patch
-  renames these members as md5_init_func and md5_update_func to
-  avoid name conflict. For completeness, MD5_params.md5_final was
-  also renamed as md5_final_func.
+  Due to WSAPoll bugs, libcurl does not work as intended. When the cURL
+  library is used to setup a connection to an incorrect port, normally the
+  result is CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT, /* 7 */, but due to the bug in WSAPoll,

-  not complain when given a URL with an IPv6 numerical address without
-  brackets. It would simply cut off the last ":[hex]" part and thus not

-  
-  That's a URL using an illegal syntax and now libcurl will instead return
-  a clear error code and error message detailing the error.
-  
-  The above mentioned bug report claims this to be a regression but
-  libcurl does not guarantee functionality when given URLs that aren't
-  following the URL spec (RFC3986 mostly). I consider the fact that it

-- -# progress meter: avoid superfluous updates and duplicate lines
-  
-  By comparing if a different "progress point" is reached or not since the
-  previous update, the progress function callback for this now avoids many
-  superfluous screen updates. This has the nice side-effect that it fixes
-  a problem that causes a second progress meter line.
-  
-  The second line output happened because when we use the -# progress
-  meter, we force a newline output after the transfer in the main loop in
-  curl, but when libcurl calls the progress callback from
-  curl_easy_cleanup() it would then output the progress display
-  again. Possibly the naive newline output is wrong but this optimization
-  was suitable anyway...

-  OpenSSL: Made cert hostname check conform to RFC 6125
-  
-  This change replaces RFC 2818 based hostname check in OpenSSL build with
-  RFC 6125 [1] based one.
-  
-  The hostname check in RFC 2818 is ambiguous and each project implements
-  it in the their own way and they are slightly different. I check curl,
-  gnutls, Firefox and Chrome and they are all different.
-  
-  I don't think there is a bug in current implementation of hostname
-  check. But it is not as strict as the modern browsers do. Currently,
-  curl allows multiple wildcard character '*' and it matches '.'. (as
-  described in the comment in ssluse.c).
+- cmdline: parse numerical options stricter
   
-  Firefox implementation is also based on RFC 2818 but it only allows at
-  most one wildcard character and it must be in the left-most label in the
-  pattern and the wildcard must not be followed by any character in the
-  label.[2] Chromium implementation is based on RFC 6125 as my patch does.
-  Firefox and Chromium both require wildcard in the left-most label in the
-  presented identifier.
+  1 - str2offset() no longer accepts negative numbers since offsets are by
+  nature positive.
   
-  This patch is more strict than the current implementation, so there may
-  be some cases where old curl works but new one does not. But at the same
-  time I think it is good practice to follow the modern browsers do and
-  follow the newer RFC.
+  2 - introduced str2unum() for the command line parser that accepts
+  numericals which are not supposed to be negative, so that it will
+  properly complain on apparent bad uses and mistakes.

-  smtp: Cody tidy up of md5 digest length
+  https_getsock: provided for schannel backend as well
+  
+  The function https_getsock was only implemented properly when USE_SSLEAY
+  or USE_GNUTLS is defined, but it is also necessary for USE_SCHANNEL.
   
-  Replaced the hard coded md5 digest length (16) with a preprocessor
-  constant
+  The problem occurs when Curl_read_plain or Curl_write_plain returns
+  CURLE_AGAIN. In that case CURL_OK is returned to the multi-interface an
+  the used socket is set to state CURL_POLL_REMOVE and the easy-state is
+  set to CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT. This is fine, because later the socket
+  should be set to CURL_POLL_IN or CURL_POLL_OUT via multi_getsock. That's
+  where https_getsock is called and doesn't return any sockets.

-  md5: Add support for calculating the md5 sum of buffers incrementally
-  
-  It is now possible to calculate the md5 sum as the stream of buffers
-  becomes known where as previously it was only possible to calculate the
-  md5 sum of a pre-prepared buffer.

-Steve Holme (28 Mar 2012)
-- TODO: Corrected POP3 section heading
+  Since WinSSL cannot be build without SSPI being enabled,
+  USE_WINSSL now defaults to the value of USE_SSPI.
+  
+  The makefile does now raise an error if WinSSL is enabled
+  while SSPI is disabled.

-- curl-functions.m4: update detection logic of getaddrinfo() thread-safeness
+- winbuild: Aligned USE_SSPI with other USE_x defines
+  
+  Renamed external parameter USE_SSPI = yes/no to ENABLE_SSPI = yes/no.
+  Backwards compatible change: USE_SSPI can still be passed as external
+  parameter with yes/no value as long as ENABLE_SSPI is not given.
   
-  Take in account that h_errno might be a modifiable lvalue not defined as
-  a C preprocessor macro
+  USE_x defines are passed around with true/false values internally,
+  USE_SSPI is now aligned to this approach, but still accepts external
+  values yes/no being passed, just like the other defines.

-Steve Holme (26 Mar 2012)
-- test #809: Updated error code to match recent pop3 changes
+  Printing the cipher number in verbose mode was something only TLS/SSL
+  programmers might understand, so I had it print the name of the cipher,
+  just like in the OpenSSL code. That'll be at least a little bit easier
+  to understand. The SecureTransport API doesn't have a method of getting

      git format-patch remotes/origin/master
 
  This creates files in your local directory named NNNN-[name].patch for each
  commit.
 
  Now send those patches off to the curl-library list. You can of course opt to
- do that with the 'get send-email' command.
+ do that with the 'git send-email' command.
 
 3.3 How To Make a Patch without git
 
  Keep a copy of the unmodified curl sources. Make your changes in a separate
  source tree. When you think you have something that you want to offer the
  curl community, use GNU diff to generate patches.

 .IP CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL

 If this option is set and libcurl has been built with the standard name

If you need to operate on only the headers from the final response, you will need to collect headers in the callback yourself and use HTTP status lines, for example, to delimit response boundaries. 
 <p class="level1">When a server sends a chunked encoded transfer, it may contain a trailer. That trailer is identical to a HTTP header and if such a trailer is received it is passed to the application using this callback as well. There are several ways to detect it being a trailer and not an ordinary header: 1) it comes after the response-body. 2) it comes after the final header line (CR LF) 3) a Trailer: header among the regular response-headers mention what header(s) to expect in the trailer.

 .IP CURLMOPT_PIPELINING
 Pass a long set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Enabling pipelining on a multi
 handle will make it attempt to perform HTTP Pipelining as far as possible for
 transfers using this handle. This means that if you add a second request that
 can use an already existing connection, the second request will be \&"piped"
 on the same connection rather than being executed in parallel. (Added in

 libcurl to keep timeouts and retries etc to work. A timeout value of -1 means

+.IP CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS
+Pass a long. The set number will be used as the maximum amount of
+simultaneously open connections to a single host. For each new session to
+a host, libcurl will open a new connection up to the limit set by
+CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS. When the limit is reached, the sessions will

+(Added in 7.30.0)
+.IP CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH
+Pass a long. The set number will be used as the maximum amount of requests
+in a pipelined connection. When this limit is reached, libcurl will use another
+connection to the same host (see CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS), or queue the
+requests until one of the pipelines to the host is ready to accept a request.
+Thus, the total number of requests in-flight is CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS *
+CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH.
+The default value is 5.

+with a Content-Length larger than CURLMOPT_CONTENT_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE, that
+connection will not be considered for additional requests, even if it is
+shorter than CURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH.
+The default value is 0, which means that the penalization is inactive.

+larger than CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE, that connection will not be
+considered for additional requests, even if it is shorter than

+.IP CURLMOPT_PIPELINING_SITE_BL
+Pass an array of char *, ending with NULL. This is a list of sites that are
+blacklisted from pipelining, i.e sites that are known to not support HTTP

 by using CA cert bundle that the SSL library can use to make sure the peer's
 server certificate is valid.

+     ====================================================================
 
+If libcurl was built with Schannel (Microsoft's TLS/SSL engine) or Secure
+Transport (Apple's TLS/SSL engine) support, then libcurl will still perform
+peer certificate verification, but instead of using a CA cert bundle, it will
+use the certificates that are built into the OS. These are the same
+certificates that appear in the Internet Options control panel (under Windows)
+or Keychain Access application (under OS X). Any custom security rules for
+certificates will be honored.
+
+Schannel will run CRL checks on certificates unless peer verification is
+disabled. Secure Transport on iOS will run OCSP checks on certificates unless
+peer verification is disabled. Secure Transport on OS X will run either OCSP
+or CRL checks on certificates if those features are enabled, and this behavior
+can be adjusted in the preferences of Keychain Access.

 6.4 send data in chunks
 
   Currently, telnet sends data one byte at a time.  This is fine for interactive
   use, but inefficient for any other.  Sent data should be sent in larger
   chunks.

+
+7.1 Specify the preferred authentication mechanism
+
+ Add the ability to specify the preferred authentication mechanism or a list
+ of mechanisms that should be used. Not only that, but the order that is

+
+7.2 Initial response
+
+ Add the ability for the user to specify whether the initial response is
+ included in the AUTH command. Some email servers, such as Microsoft
+ Exchange, can work with either whilst others need to have the initial
+ response sent separately:
+
+ http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-03/0114.html
+
+7.3 Pipelining
+
+ Add support for pipelining emails.
+
+7.4 Graceful base64 decoding failure
+
+ Rather than shutting down the session and returning an error when the
+ decoding of a base64 encoded authentication response fails, we should
+ gracefully shutdown the authentication process by sending a * response to the
+ server as per RFC4954.

+
+10.1 SASL based authentication mechanisms
+
+ Currently the LDAP module only supports ldap_simple_bind_s() in order to bind
+ to an LDAP server. However, this function sends username and password details
+ using the simple authentication mechanism (as clear text). However, it should
+ be possible to use ldap_bind_s() instead specifing the security context
+ information ourselves.
 
-7.1 Disable specific versions
+11. New protocols
+
+11.1 RSYNC
+
+ There's no RFC for the protocol or an URI/URL format.  An implementation
+ should most probably use an existing rsync library, such as librsync.

+12. SSL
+
+12.1 Disable specific versions
 
  Provide an option that allows for disabling specific SSL versions, such as
  SSLv2 http://curl.haxx.se/bug/feature.cgi?id=1767276
 
-7.2 Provide mutex locking API
+12.2 Provide mutex locking API
 
  Provide a libcurl API for setting mutex callbacks in the underlying SSL
  library, so that the same application code can use mutex-locking
  independently of OpenSSL or GnutTLS being used.
 
-7.3 Evaluate SSL patches
+12.3 Evaluate SSL patches
 
  Evaluate/apply Gertjan van Wingerde's SSL patches:
  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2004-03/0087.html
 
-7.4 Cache OpenSSL contexts
+12.4 Cache OpenSSL contexts
 
  "Look at SSL cafile - quick traces look to me like these are done on every
  request as well, when they should only be necessary once per ssl context (or
  once per handle)". The major improvement we can rather easily do is to make
  sure we don't create and kill a new SSL "context" for every request, but
  instead make one for every connection and re-use that SSL context in the same
  style connections are re-used. It will make us use slightly more memory but
  it will libcurl do less creations and deletions of SSL contexts.
 
-7.5 Export session ids
+12.5 Export session ids
 
  Add an interface to libcurl that enables "session IDs" to get
  exported/imported. Cris Bailiff said: "OpenSSL has functions which can
  serialise the current SSL state to a buffer of your choice, and recover/reset
  the state from such a buffer at a later date - this is used by mod_ssl for
  apache to implement and SSL session ID cache".
 
-7.6 Provide callback for cert verification
+12.6 Provide callback for cert verification
 
  OpenSSL supports a callback for customised verification of the peer
  certificate, but this doesn't seem to be exposed in the libcurl APIs. Could
  it be? There's so much that could be done if it were!
 
-7.7 Support other SSL libraries
+12.7 Support other SSL libraries
 
  Make curl's SSL layer capable of using other free SSL libraries.  Such as
  MatrixSSL (http://www.matrixssl.org/).
 
-7.9 improve configure --with-ssl
+12.8 improve configure --with-ssl
 
  make the configure --with-ssl option first check for OpenSSL, then GnuTLS,
  then NSS...

  DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is a way to provide SSL
  keys and certs over DNS using DNSSEC as an alternative to the CA model.

+/*
+ * Nasty internal details ahead...
+ *
+ * File curl_memory.h must be included by _all_ *.c source files
+ * that use memory related functions strdup, malloc, calloc, realloc
+ * or free, and given source file is used to build libcurl library.
+ *
+ * There is nearly no exception to above rule. All libcurl source
+ * files in 'lib' subdirectory as well as those living deep inside
+ * 'packages' subdirectories and linked together in order to build
+ * libcurl library shall follow it.
+ *
+ * File lib/strdup.c is an exception, given that it provides a strdup
+ * clone implementation while using malloc. Extra care needed inside
+ * this one. TODO: revisit this paragraph and related code.
+ *
+ * The need for curl_memory.h inclusion is due to libcurl's feature
+ * of allowing library user to provide memory replacement functions,
+ * memory callbacks, at runtime with curl_global_init_mem()
+ *
+ * Any *.c source file used to build libcurl library that does not
+ * include curl_memory.h and uses any memory function of the five
+ * mentioned above will compile without any indication, but it will
+ * trigger weird memory related issues at runtime.
+ *
+ * OTOH some source files from 'lib' subdirectory may additionally be
+ * used directly as source code when using some curlx_ functions by
+ * third party programs that don't even use libcurl at all. When using
+ * these source files in this way it is necessary these are compiled
+ * with CURLX_NO_MEMORY_CALLBACKS defined, in order to ensure that no
+ * attempt of calling libcurl's memory callbacks is done from code
+ * which can not use this machinery.
+ *
+ * Notice that libcurl's 'memory tracking' system works chaining into
+ * the memory callback machinery. This implies that when compiling
+ * 'lib' source files with CURLX_NO_MEMORY_CALLBACKS defined this file
+ * disengages usage of libcurl's 'memory tracking' system, defining
+ * MEMDEBUG_NODEFINES and overriding CURLDEBUG purpose.
+ *
+ * CURLX_NO_MEMORY_CALLBACKS takes precedence over CURLDEBUG. This is
+ * done in order to allow building a 'memory tracking' enabled libcurl
+ * and at the same time allow building programs which do not use it.
+ *
+ * Programs and libraries in 'tests' subdirectories have specific
+ * purposes and needs, and as such each one will use whatever fits
+ * best, depending additionally wether it links with libcurl or not.
+ *
+ * Caveat emptor. Proper curlx_* separation is a work in progress
+ * the same as CURLX_NO_MEMORY_CALLBACKS usage, some adjustments may
+ * still be required. IOW don't use them yet, there are sharp edges.

   It isn't easy for an app to do this association. The lib should probably
   still resolve the second one properly to make sure that they actually _can_
   be considered for pipelining. Also, asking for explicit pipelining on handle
   X may be tricky when handle X get a closed connection.
