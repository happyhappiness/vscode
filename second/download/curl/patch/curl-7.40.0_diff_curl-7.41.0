-Daniel Stenberg (7 Jan 2015)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: version 7.40.0
+Daniel Stenberg (25 Feb 2015)
+- THANKS: added contributors from the 7.41.0 RELEASE-NOTES
 
-- darwinssl: fix session ID keys to only reuse identical sessions
-  
-  ...to avoid a session ID getting cached without certificate checking and
-  then after a subsequent _enabling_ of the check libcurl could still
-  re-use the session done without cert checks.

-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108A.html
-  Reported-by: Marc Hesse
+  This reverts commit 03fa576833643c67579ae216c4e7350fa9b5f2fe.
 
-- tests: make sure CRLFs can't be used in URLs passed to proxy
+- telnet.c: fix invalid use of custom read function if not being set
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108B.html
+  obj_count can be 1 if the custom read function is set or the stdin
+  handle is a reference to a pipe. Since the pipe should be handled
+  using the PeekNamedPipe-check below, the custom read function should
+  only be used if it is actually enabled.
 
-- url-parsing: reject CRLFs within URLs
+- telnet.c: fix handling of 0 being returned from custom read function
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108B.html
-  Reported-by: Andrey Labunets
+  According to [1]: "Returning 0 will signal end-of-file to the library
+  and cause it to stop the current transfer."
+  This change makes the Windows telnet code handle this case accordingly.

-- ldap: Fixed Unicode usage for all Win32 builds
+- [Julian Ospald brought this change]
+
+  configure: allow both --with-ca-bundle and --with-ca-path
   
-  Otherwise, the fixes in the previous commits would only be applicable
-  to IDN and SSPI based builds and not others such as OpenSSL with LDAP
-  enabled.
+  SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations by default (and if given non-Null
+  parameters) searches the CAfile first and falls back to CApath.  This
+  allows for CAfile to be a basis (e.g. installed by the package manager)
+  and CApath to be a user configured directory.
+  
+  This wasn't reflected by the previous configure constraint which this
+  patch fixes.

-- ldap: Pass write length in all Curl_client_write() calls
-  
-  As we get the length for the DN and attribute variables, and we know
-  the length for the line terminator, pass the length values rather than
-  zero as this will save Curl_client_write() from having to perform an
-  additional strlen() call.

+- build: Removed Visual Studio SuppressStartupBanner directive for VC8+
   
-  Fixed memory leaks from commit 086ad79970 as was noted in the commit
-  comments.
+  Visual Studio 2005 and above defaults to disabling the startup banner
+  for the Compiler, Linker and MIDL tools (with /NOLOGO). As such there
+  is no need to explicitly set the SuppressStartupBanner directive, as
+  this is a leftover from the VC7 and VC7.1 projects being upgraded to
+  VC8 and above.

-                        sign
+  For consistency with other conditionally compiled code in openssl.c,

+  HAVE_BORINGSSL outside of openssl.c when the OpenSSL header files are
+  not included.

-  parseurlandfillconn(): fix improper non-numeric scope_id stripping.
-  Fixes SF bug 1149: http://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1449/
+- THANKS: 14 new contributors from the 7.40.0 release notes
 
-- IPV6: address scope != scope id
-  There was a confusion between these: this commit tries to disambiguate them.
-  - Scope can be computed from the address itself.
-  - Scope id is scope dependent: it is currently defined as 1-based local
-    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
-    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
-    addresses.
-  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
-  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
-  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
-  to bind to an interface.
-  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
-  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
-  the interface index.
-  
-  This commit should fix SF bug #1451.

-- tool_urlglob: unify return codes to use CURLcode
+- tests: make sure CRLFs can't be used in URLs passed to proxy
   
-  There was a mix of GlobCode, CURLcode and ints and they were mostly
-  passing around CURLcode errors. This change makes the functions use only
-  CURLcode and removes the GlobCode type completely.

-  with . would not be escaped into .. and could be interpreted as the end
-  of transmission string instead.
-  
-  This only affected libcurl based applications that used a read function
-  and wasn't reproducible with the curl command-line tool.

-  libcurl: add UNIX domain sockets support
-  
-  The ability to do HTTP requests over a UNIX domain socket has been
-  requested before, in Apr 2008 [0][1] and Sep 2010 [2]. While a
-  discussion happened, no patch seems to get through. I decided to give it
-  a go since I need to test a nginx HTTP server which listens on a UNIX
-  domain socket.
-  
-  One patch [3] seems to make it possible to use the
-  CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION function to gain a UNIX domain socket.
-  Another person wrote a Go program which can do HTTP over a UNIX socket
-  for Docker[4] which uses a special URL scheme (though the name contains
-  cURL, it has no relation to the cURL library).
-  
-  This patch considers support for UNIX domain sockets at the same level
-  as HTTP proxies / IPv6, it acts as an intermediate socket provider and
-  not as a separate protocol. Since this feature affects network
-  operations, a new feature flag was added ("unix-sockets") with a
-  corresponding CURL_VERSION_UNIX_SOCKETS macro.
-  
-  A new CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH option is added and documented. This
-  option enables UNIX domain sockets support for all requests on the
-  handle (replacing IP sockets and skipping proxies).
+- sockfilt.c: Replace 100ms sleep with thread throttle
   
-  A new configure option (--enable-unix-sockets) and CMake option
-  (ENABLE_UNIX_SOCKETS) can disable this optional feature. Note that I
-  deliberately did not mark this feature as advanced, this is a
-  feature/component that should easily be available.
+  Improves performance of test cases 574 and 575 by 50%.

-  and 6 since the variable. Functions which receive this parameter
-  have their `$port` parameter renamed to `$port_or_path` to support a

+  the variables that store the return value, to avoid any confusion.
 
-  sws: try to remove socket and retry bind
-  
-  If sws is killed it might leave a stale socket file on the filesystem

-  removed and another bind is executed.

-  that enables checking for UNIX domain socket support.

-- smtp: Fixed dot stuffing being performed when no new data read

-  Whilst I had moved the dot stuffing code from being performed before
-  CRLF conversion takes place to after it, in commit 4bd860a001, I had
-  moved it outside the 'when something read' block of code when meant
-  it could perform the dot stuffing twice on partial send if nread
-  happened to contain the right values. It also meant the function could
-  potentially read past the end of buffer. This was highlighted by the
-  following warning:
+  Second patch to enable Windows support using Cygwin-based OpenSSH.
   
-  warning: `nread' might be used uninitialized in this function
+  Tested with CopSSH 5.0.0 free edition using an msys shell on Windows 7.

+  parseurlandfillconn(): fix improper non-numeric scope_id stripping.
+  Fixes SF bug 1149: http://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1449/
 
-  smb: Added configuration options for SMB
+- IPV6: address scope != scope id
+  There was a confusion between these: this commit tries to disambiguate them.
+  - Scope can be computed from the address itself.
+  - Scope id is scope dependent: it is currently defined as 1-based local
+    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
+    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
+    addresses.
+  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
+  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
+  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
+  to bind to an interface.
+  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
+  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
+  the interface index.
   
-  Added --enable-smb and --disable-smb configuration options for the
-  upcoming SMB/CIFS protocol support.
+  This commit should fix SF bug #1451.

-  symbol-scan.pl: do not require autotools
+  libcurl: add UNIX domain sockets support
+  
+  The ability to do HTTP requests over a UNIX domain socket has been
+  requested before, in Apr 2008 [0][1] and Sep 2010 [2]. While a
+  discussion happened, no patch seems to get through. I decided to give it
+  a go since I need to test a nginx HTTP server which listens on a UNIX
+  domain socket.
+  
+  One patch [3] seems to make it possible to use the
+  CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION function to gain a UNIX domain socket.
+  Another person wrote a Go program which can do HTTP over a UNIX socket
+  for Docker[4] which uses a special URL scheme (though the name contains
+  cURL, it has no relation to the cURL library).
+  
+  This patch considers support for UNIX domain sockets at the same level
+  as HTTP proxies / IPv6, it acts as an intermediate socket provider and
+  not as a separate protocol. Since this feature affects network
+  operations, a new feature flag was added ("unix-sockets") with a
+  corresponding CURL_VERSION_UNIX_SOCKETS macro.
+  
+  A new CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH option is added and documented. This
+  option enables UNIX domain sockets support for all requests on the
+  handle (replacing IP sockets and skipping proxies).
   
-  Makes test1119 pass when building with cmake.
+  A new configure option (--enable-unix-sockets) and CMake option
+  (ENABLE_UNIX_SOCKETS) can disable this optional feature. Note that I
+  deliberately did not mark this feature as advanced, this is a
+  feature/component that should easily be available.
   
-  configurehelp.pm is generated by configure (autotools). As cmake does
-  not provide a separate variable for the C preprocessor, default to cpp.
-  Before commit ef24ecde68a5f577a7f0f423a767620f09a0ab16 ("symbol-scan:
-  use configure script knowledge about how to run the C preprocessor"),
-  this tool would also use 'cpp'.

+  test1435: a simple test that checks whether a HTTP request can be

-  For symmetry with autotools, CURL_USE_ARES is renamed to ENABLE_ARES
-  (--enable-ares). Checks that test for the availability actually use
-  USE_ARES instead as that is the result of whether a-res is available or

-  Some versions of Microsoft's sspi.h don't define this.

+  Whilst I had moved the dot stuffing code from being performed before
+  CRLF conversion takes place to after it, in commit 4bd860a001, I had

-  compilation warning:
+  Commit curl-7_23_1-143-g8218064 changed the parameter of
+  responsive_http_server to accept types other than IPv6 (converting
+  from a boolean to a string), but only considered the lower-case "ipv6"
+  and not the "IPv6" variant. This caused all servers to start in IPv4
+  mode instead.
   
-  warning: 'struct digestdata' declared inside parameter list
+  This patch converts the remaining cases to "ipv6". While not strictly
+  necessary for the run*server variants, these got also converted for

-  There were several -Wunused warnings and one duplicate macro definition.
-  The EXTRA_DEFINES variable of the CurlCheckCSources macro was being
-  abused ("__unused1\n#undef inline\n#define __unused2", seriously?) to
-  insert extra C code. Avoid this broken abstraction and use cmake's
-  check_c_source_compiles directly (works fine with CMake 2.8, maybe
-  even cmake 2.6).
-  
-  After cleaning up all related variables (EXTRA_DEFINES,
-  HEADER_INCLUDES, auxiliary headers_hack), also remove a duplicate
-  add_headers_include macro and remove duplicate header additions before
-  the struct timeval check.
-  
-  Oh, and now the code is converted to use CheckCSourceRuns and

-  cmake: fix gethostby{addr,name}_r in CurlTests
-  
-  This patch cleans up the automatically-generated (?) code and fixes one
-  case that will always fail due to syntax error.
-  
-  HAVE_GETHOSTBYADDR_R_5_REENTRANT always failed because of a trailing
-  character ("int length;q"). Several parameter type and unused variable
-  warnings popped up. This causes a detection failure with -Werror.
+- [Jay Satiro brought this change]
+
+  examples: Wait recommended 100ms when no file descriptors are ready
   
-  Observe that the REENTRANT cases are exactly the same as their
-  non-REENTRANT cases except for a `_REENTRANT` macro definition.
-  Merge all these pieces and build one big main function with different
-  cases, but reusing variables where logical.
+  Prior to this change when no file descriptors were ready on platforms
+  other than Windows the multi examples would sleep whatever was in
+  timeout, which may or may not have been less than the minimum
+  recommended value [1] of 100ms.
   
-  For the cases where the parameters where NULL, I looked at
-  lib/hostip4.c to get an idea of the parameters types.

-  void-cast variables such as 'rc' to avoid -Wuninitialized errors.
+  When the connection code decides to close a socket it informs the multi
+  system via the Curl_multi_closed function. The multi system may, in
+  turn, invoke the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION function with
+  CURL_POLL_REMOVE. This happens after the socket has already been
+  closed. Reorder the code so that CURL_POLL_REMOVE is called before the
+  socket is closed.

-- Added MinGW support to build with nghttp2.
+  This means it was not possible to build libcurl without HTTP support
+  and use NTLM for other protocols such as IMAP, POP3 and SMTP. Rather
+  than introduce a new SASL pre-processor definition, removed the HTTP
+  prerequisite just like USE_SPNEGO and USE_KRB5.

+  Note: Winbind support still needs to be dependent on CURL_DISABLE_HTTP

+- [Jay Satiro brought this change]
 
-  GnuTLS: Implement public key pinning
+  SSL: PolarSSL default min SSL version TLS 1.0
+  
+  - Prior to this change no SSL minimum version was set by default at
+  runtime for PolarSSL. Therefore in most cases PolarSSL would probably
+  have defaulted to a minimum version of SSLv3 which is no longer secure.

+- opts-Makefile: put more man pages into dist and make hmtl+pdf
 
-  SSL: implement public key pinning
-  
-  Option --pinnedpubkey takes a path to a public key in DER format and
-  only connect if it matches (currently only implemented with OpenSSL).
-  
-  Provides CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY for curl_easy_setopt().
+- curl_multi_setopt.3: refer to stand-alone pages
   
-  Extract a public RSA key from a website like so:
-  openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 2>&1 < /dev/null | \
-  sed -n '/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p' | openssl x509 -noout -pubkey \
-  | openssl rsa -pubin -outform DER > google.com.der
+  ... instead of duplicating info.
 
-- multi_runsingle: fix possible memory leak
-

-  Curl_retry_request() returns failure so free it if need be.
+- opts: more multi options as stand-alone man pages
 
-- ares::Curl_resolver_cancel: skip checking for NULL conn
+- Makefile.am: two cmake files are gone
   
-  Coverity CID 1243581. 'conn' will never be NULL here, and if it would be
-  the subsequent statement would dereference it!

+  CurlCheckCSourceRuns.cmake files
 
-- parseconfig: skip a NULL check
-  
-  Coverity CID 1154198. This NULL check implies that the pointer _can_ be
-  NULL at this point, which it can't. Thus it is dead code. It tricks
-  static analyzers to warn about dereferencing the pointer since the code
-  seems to imply it can be NULL.

-- getparameter: remove dead code
+  There were several -Wunused warnings and one duplicate macro definition.
+  The EXTRA_DEFINES variable of the CurlCheckCSources macro was being
+  abused ("__unused1\n#undef inline\n#define __unused2", seriously?) to

-
-  ssh: improve key file search
+  HAVE_GETHOSTBYADDR_R_5_REENTRANT always failed because of a trailing
+  character ("int length;q"). Several parameter type and unused variable
+  warnings popped up. This causes a detection failure with -Werror.
   
-  For private keys, use the first match from: user-specified key file
-  (if provided), ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ./id_rsa, ./id_dsa
+  Observe that the REENTRANT cases are exactly the same as their
+  non-REENTRANT cases except for a `_REENTRANT` macro definition.
+  Merge all these pieces and build one big main function with different
+  cases, but reusing variables where logical.
   
-  Note that the previous code only looked for id_dsa files. id_rsa is
-  now generally preferred, as it supports larger key sizes.
+  For the cases where the parameters where NULL, I looked at
+  lib/hostip4.c to get an idea of the parameters types.
   
-  For public keys, use the user-specified key file, if provided.
-  Otherwise, try to extract the public key from the private key file.
-  This means that passing --pubkey is typically no longer required,
-  and makes the key-handling behavior more like OpenSSH.

+  separating multiple pre-processor definitions.
   
-  This patch fixes the "SSL3_WRITE_PENDING: bad write retry" error that
-  sometimes occurs when sending an email over SMTPS with OpenSSL. OpenSSL
-  appears to require the same pointer on a write that follows a retry
-  (CURLE_AGAIN) as discussed here:

+Guenter Knauf (26 Oct 2014)

+- http_negotiate: We prefer 'CURLcode result'
   
-  As a sort of step forward, this script will now first try to get the
-  data from the HTTPS URL using curl, and only if that fails it will
-  switch back to the HTTP transfer using perl's native LWP functionality.
-  To reduce the risk of this script being tricked.
+  Continuing commit 0eb3d15ccb more return code variable name changes.
+
+- http_negotiate: Fixed missing check for USE_SPNEGO
+
+- sspi: Synchronization of cleanup code between auth mechanisms
+
+- sspi: Renamed max token length variables
   
-  Using HTTPS to get a cert bundle introduces a chicken-and-egg problem so
-  we can't really ever completely disable HTTP, but chances are that most
-  users already have a ca cert bundle that trusts the mozilla.org site
-  that this script downloads from.
+  Code cleanup to try and synchronise code between the different SSPI
+  based authentication mechanisms.
+
+- sspi: Renamed expiry time stamp variables
   
-  A future version of this script will probably switch to require a
-  dedicated "insecure" command line option to allow downloading over HTTP
-  (or unverified HTTPS).
+  Code cleanup to try and synchronise code between the different SSPI
+  based authentication mechanisms.
 
-- LICENSE-MIXING: removed krb4 info
+- sspi: Only call CompleteAuthToken() when complete is needed
   
-  krb4 has been dropped since a while now
+  Don't call CompleteAuthToken() after InitializeSecurityContext() has
+  returned SEC_I_CONTINUE_NEEDED as this return code only indicates the
+  function should be called again after receiving a response back from
+  the server.
+  
+  This only affected the Digest and NTLM authentication code.

-  The low-speed logic for example could easily be made to set very many

+  ntlm: Fixed HTTP proxy authentication when using Windows SSPI
   
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() would simply cast the SPN variable
-  to a TCHAR when calling InitializeSecurityContext(). This meant that,
-  under Unicode builds, it would not be valid wide character string.
+  Removed ISC_REQ_* flags from calls to InitializeSecurityContext to fix
+  bug in NTLM handshake for HTTP proxy authentication.
   
-  Updated to use the recently introduced Curl_sasl_build_spn() function
-  which performs the correct conversion for us.
+  NTLM handshake for HTTP proxy authentication failed with error
+  SEC_E_INVALID_TOKEN from InitializeSecurityContext for certain proxy
+  servers on generating the NTLM Type-3 message.
+  
+  The flag ISC_REQ_CONFIDENTIALITY seems to cause the problem according

-- sasl: Introduced Curl_sasl_build_spn() for building a SPN
+Daniel Stenberg (12 Sep 2014)
+- [Ray Satiro brought this change]
+
+  newlines: fix mixed newlines to LF-only
   
-  Various parts of the libcurl source code build a SPN for inclusion in
-  authentication data. This information is either used by our own native
-  generation routines or passed to authentication functions in third-party
-  libraries such as SSPI. However, some of these instances use fixed
-  buffers rather than dynamically allocated ones and not all of those that
-  should, convert to wide character strings in Unicode builds.
+  I use the curl repo mainly on Windows with the typical Windows git
+  checkout which converts the LF line endings in the curl repo to CRLF
+  automatically on checkout. The automatic conversion is not done on files
+  in the repo with mixed line endings. I recently noticed some weird
+  output with projects/build-openssl.bat that I traced back to mixed line
+  endings, so I scanned the repo and there are files (excluding the
+  test data) that have mixed line endings.
   
-  Implemented a common function that generates a SPN and performs the
-  wide character conversion where necessary.
+  I used this command below to do the scan. Unfortunately it's not as easy
+  as git grep, at least not on Windows. This gets the names of all the
+  files in the repo's HEAD, gets each of those files raw from HEAD, checks
+  for mixed line endings of both LF and CRLF, and prints the name if
+  mixed. I excluded path tests/data/test* because those can have mixed
+  line endings if I understand correctly.
+  
+  for f in `git ls-tree --name-only --full-tree -r HEAD`;
+  do if [ -n "${f##tests/data/test*}" ];
+      then git show "HEAD:$f" | \
+          perl -0777 -ne 'exit 1 if /([^\r]\n.*\r\n)|(\r\n.*[^\r]\n)/';
+      if [ $? -ne 0 ];

-  conncache: fix compiler warning
-  
-  warning C4267: '=' : conversion from 'size_t' to 'long', possible loss
-  of data
-  
-  The member connection_id of struct connectdata is a long (always a
-  32-bit signed integer on Visual C++) and the member next_connection_id
-  of struct conncache is a size_t, so one of them should be changed to
-  match the other.

-  Don't abort Negotiate auth when the server has a response for us
-  
-  It's wrong to assume that we can send a single SPNEGO packet which will
-  complete the authentication. It's a *negotiation* — the clue is in the
-  name. So make sure we handle responses from the server.
+  Cmake: Added missing protocol-disable switches
   
-  Curl_input_negotiate() will already handle bailing out if it thinks the
-  state is GSS_S_COMPLETE (or SEC_E_OK on Windows) and the server keeps
-  talking to us, so we should avoid endless loops that way.
+  They already have their defines in config.h. This makes it possible to

-  Use SPNEGO for HTTP Negotiate
-  
-  This is the correct way to do SPNEGO. Just ask for it
+  Cmake: Require at least CMake 2.8.
   
-  Now I correctly see it trying NTLMSSP authentication when a Kerberos ticket
-  isn't available. Of course, we bail out when the server responds with the
-  challenge packet, since we don't expect that. But I'll fix that bug next...
-
-- [David Woodhouse brought this change]
+  CMake 2.6 is already a bit old. Many bugs have been fixed since
+  its release. We use 2.8 in our company and we have no intention
+  of polluting our environment with old software, so 2.6 would
+  not be tested. This shouldn't be a problem since all one need
+  to build CMake from source is C and C++ compiler.
 
-  Remove all traces of FBOpenSSL SPNEGO support
-  
-  This is just fundamentally broken. SPNEGO (RFC4178) is a protocol which
-  allows client and server to negotiate the underlying mechanism which will
-  actually be used to authenticate. This is *often* Kerberos, and can also
-  be NTLM and other things. And to complicate matters, there are various
-  different OIDs which can be used to specify the Kerberos mechanism too.
-  
-  A SPNEGO exchange will identify *which* GSSAPI mechanism is being used,
-  and will exchange GSSAPI tokens which are appropriate for that mechanism.
-  
-  But this SPNEGO implementation just strips the incoming SPNEGO packet
-  and extracts the token, if any. And completely discards the information
-  about *which* mechanism is being used. Then we *assume* it was Kerberos,
-  and feed the token into gss_init_sec_context() with the default
-  mechanism (GSS_S_NO_OID for the mech_type argument).
-  
-  Furthermore... broken as this code is, it was never even *used* for input
-  tokens anyway, because higher layers of curl would just bail out if the
-  server actually said anything *back* to us in the negotiation. We assume
-  that we send a single token to the server, and it accepts it. If the server
-  wants to continue the exchange (as is required for NTLM and for SPNEGO
-  to do anything useful), then curl was broken anyway.
+- disconnect: don't touch easy-related state on disconnects
   
-  So the only bit which actually did anything was the bit in
-  Curl_output_negotiate(), which always generates an *initial* SPNEGO
-  token saying "Hey, I support only the Kerberos mechanism and this is its
-  token".
+  This was done to make sure NTLM state that is bound to a connection
+  doesn't survive and gets used for the subsequent request - but
+  disconnects can also be done to for example make room in the connection
+  cache and thus that connection is not strictly related to the easy
+  handle's current operation.
   
-  You could have done that by manually just prefixing the Kerberos token
-  with the appropriate bytes, if you weren't going to do any proper SPNEGO
-  handling. There's no need for the FBOpenSSL library at all.
+  The http authentication state is still kept in the easy handle since all
+  http auth _except_ NTLM is connection independent and thus survive over
+  multiple connections.
   
-  The sane way to do SPNEGO is just to *ask* the GSSAPI library to do
-  SPNEGO. That's what the 'mech_type' argument to gss_init_sec_context()
-  is for. And then it should all Just Work™.

-  The AES-GCM ciphers were added to GnuTLS as late as ver. 3.0.1 but
-  the code path in which they're referenced here is only ever used for
-  somewhat older GnuTLS versions. This caused undeclared identifier errors
-  when compiling against those.
+- smtp: Added support for GSSAPI (Kerberos V5) authentication via Windows SSPI
 
-- gnutls: explicitly added SRP to the priority string
-  
-  This seems to have become necessary for SRP support to work starting
-  with GnuTLS ver. 2.99.0. Since support for SRP was added to GnuTLS
-  before the function that takes this priority string, there should be no
-  issue with backward compatibility.

-  When an error has been detected, skip the final forced call to the
-  progress callback by making sure to pass the current return code
-  variable in the Curl_done() call in the CURLM_STATE_DONE state.
+  Bringing back the old functionality that was mistakenly removed when the
+  connection cache was remade. When creating a new connection, all the
+  existing ones are checked and those that are known to be dead get
+  disconnected for real and removed from the connection cache. It helps
+  the cache from holding on to very many stale connections and aids in
+  keeping down the number of system sockets in wait states.
   
-  This avoids the "extra" callback that could occur even if you returned
-  error from the progress callback.

   It is thus pointless to do "curl -XGET [URL]" as GET would be used
   anyway. In the same vein it is pointless to do "curl -X POST -d data
   [URL]"... But you can make a fun and somewhat rare request that sends a
   request-body in a GET request with something like "curl -X GET -d data
   [URL]"
 
-  Note that -X doesn't change curl's behavior. It only modifies the actual
-  string sent in the request.
+  Note that -X doesn't actually change curl's behavior as it only modifies the

   Accordingly, by using -XPOST on a command line that for example would follow
   a 303 redirect, you will effectively prevent curl from behaving
   correctly. Be aware.

+ *
+ * This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
+ * no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
+ * unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
+ * configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
+ * Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
+ * the properties of the two independent implementations.
+ *
+ * The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
+ * It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
+ * optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid

+ * This is an OpenSSL-compatible implementation of the RSA Data Security, Inc.

+ *
+ * (This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)
+ *
+ * This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
+ * no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
+ * unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
+ * configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
+ * Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
+ * the properties of the two independent implementations.
+ *
+ * The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
+ * It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
+ * optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
+ * compile-time configuration.
