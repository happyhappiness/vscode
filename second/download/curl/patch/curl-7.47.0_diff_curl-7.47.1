+- unit1604: Fix unit setup return code

+- tool_doswin: Improve sanitization processing
+  
+  - Add unit test 1604 to test the sanitize_file_name function.
+  
+  - Use -DCURL_STATICLIB when building libcurltool for unit testing.
+  
+  - Better detection of reserved DOS device names.
+  
+  - New flags to modify sanitize behavior:
+  
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_COLONS: Allow colons
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_PATH: Allow path separators and colons
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_RESERVED: Allow reserved device names
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_TRUNCATE: Allow truncating a long filename
+  
+  - Restore sanitization of banned characters from user-specified outfile.
+  
+  Prior to this commit sanitization of a user-specified outfile was
+  temporarily disabled in 2b6dadc because there was no way to allow path
+  separators and colons through while replacing other banned characters.
+  Now in such a case we call the sanitize function with
+  SANITIZE_ALLOW_PATH which allows path separators and colons to pass
+  through.

-- free: instead of Curl_safefree()
-  
-  Since we just started make use of free(NULL) in order to simplify code,
-  this change takes it a step further and:
-  
-  - converts lots of Curl_safefree() calls to good old free()
-  - makes Curl_safefree() not check the pointer before free()
-  
-  The (new) rule of thumb is: if you really want a function call that
-  frees a pointer and then assigns it to NULL, then use Curl_safefree().
-  But we will prefer just using free() from now on.

-  connect: Fix happy eyeballs logic for IPv4-only builds
-  
-  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/168
-  
-  (trynextip)
-  - Don't try the "other" protocol family unless IPv6 is available. In an
-  IPv4-only build the other family can only be IPv6 which is unavailable.
-  
-  This change essentially stops IPv4-only builds from attempting the
-  "happy eyeballs" secondary parallel connection that is supposed to be
-  used by the "other" address family.
-  
-  Prior to this change in IPv4-only builds that secondary parallel
-  connection attempt could be erroneously used by the same family (IPv4)
-  which caused a bug where every address after the first for a host could
-  be tried twice, often in parallel. This change fixes that bug. An
-  example of the bug is shown below.
-  
-  Assume MTEST resolves to 3 addresses 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 and 127.0.0.4:
-  
-  * STATE: INIT => CONNECT handle 0x64f4b0; line 1046 (connection #-5000)
-  * Rebuilt URL to: http://MTEST/
-  * Added connection 0. The cache now contains 1 members
-  * STATE: CONNECT => WAITRESOLVE handle 0x64f4b0; line 1083
-  (connection #0)
-  *   Trying 127.0.0.2...
-  * STATE: WAITRESOLVE => WAITCONNECT handle 0x64f4b0; line 1163

-  closesocket: call multi socket cb on close even with custom close
-  
-  In function Curl_closesocket() in connect.c the call to
-  Curl_multi_closed() was wrongly omitted if a socket close function
-  (CURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETFUNCTION) is registered.
-  
-  That would lead to not removing the socket from the internal hash table
-  and not calling the multi socket callback appropriately.

-- [Tobias Stoeckmann brought this change]
-
-  hostip: Fix signal race in Curl_resolv_timeout.
-  
-  A signal handler for SIGALRM is installed in Curl_resolv_timeout. It is
-  configured to interrupt system calls and uses siglongjmp to return into
-  the function if alarm() goes off.
-  
-  The signal handler is installed before curl_jmpenv is initialized.
-  This means that an already installed alarm timer could trigger the
-  newly installed signal handler, leading to undefined behavior when it
-  accesses the uninitialized curl_jmpenv.
-  
-  Even if there is no previously installed alarm available, the code in
-  Curl_resolv_timeout itself installs an alarm before the environment is
-  fully set up. If the process is sent into suspend right after that, the
-  signal handler could be called too early as in previous scenario.
-  
-  To fix this, the signal handler should only be installed and the alarm
-  timer only be set after sigsetjmp has been called.

-- http2: detect prematures close without data transfered

 this option may provide you with rather unexpected file names.

 <p class="level1">(HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this option will make it discard all "session cookies". This will basically have the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical browsers always discard session cookies when they're closed down. 
 <p class="level0"><a name="-J"></a><span class="nroffip">-J, --remote-header-name</span> 
 <p class="level1">(HTTP) This option tells the <a class="emphasis" href="#-O">-O, --remote-name</a> option to use the server-specified Content-Disposition filename instead of extracting a filename from the URL. 
+<p class="level1">If the server specifies a file name and a file with that name already exists in the current working directory it will not be overwritten and an error will occur. If the server doesn't specify a file name then this option has no effect. 
 <p class="level1">There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected file names. 
+<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">WARNING</span>: Exercise judicious use of this option, especially on Windows. A rogue server could send you the name of a DLL or other file that could possibly be loaded automatically by Windows or some third party software.

 <p class="level1">(SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by default. This makes all connections considered "insecure" fail unless <a class="emphasis" href="#-k">-k, --insecure</a> is used.

 <p class="level1">Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The config file is a text file in which command line arguments can be written which then will be used as if they were written on the actual command line. 
 <p class="level1">Options and their parameters must be specified on the same config file line, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign. Long option names can optionally be given in the config file without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals characters can be used as separators. If the option is specified with one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals character between the option and its parameter. 
 <p class="level1">If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the parameter must be enclosed within quotes. Within double quotes, the following escape sequences are available: \\, \", \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ignored. If the first column of a config line is a '&#35;' character, the rest of the line will be treated as a comment. Only write one option per physical line in the config file. 
 <p class="level1">Specify the filename to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read the file from stdin. 
 <p class="level1">Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify it using the <a class="emphasis" href="#--url">--url</a> option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar to this: 
-<p class="level1">url = "<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/</a>"

 <p class="level1">When curl is invoked, it always (unless <a class="emphasis" href="#-q">-q</a> is used) checks for a default config file and uses it if found. The default config file is checked for in the following places in this order: 
 <p class="level1">1) curl tries to find the "home dir": It first checks for the CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment variables. Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on Unix-like systems (which returns the home dir given the current user in your system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA variable, or as a last resort the '%USERPROFILE%\Application Data'. 
 <p class="level1">2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On Unix-like systems, it will simply try to load .curlrc from the determined home dir.

 81. When using -J (with -O), automatically resumed downloading together with
   "-C -" fails. Without -J the same command line works! This happens because
   the resume logic is worked out before the target file name (and thus its
   pre-transfer size) has been figured out!

 79. SMTP. When sending data to multiple recipients, curl will abort and return
   failure if one of the recipients indicate failure (on the "RCPT TO"
   command). Ordinary mail programs would proceed and still send to the ones
   that can receive data. This is subject for change in the future.

 75. NTLM authentication involving unicode user name or password only works

   backend. The original problem was mentioned in:

 73. if a connection is made to a FTP server but the server then just never
   sends the 220 response or otherwise is dead slow, libcurl will not
   acknowledge the connection timeout during that phase but only the "real"
   timeout - which may surprise users as it is probably considered to be the
   connect phase to most people. Brought up (and is being misunderstood) in:

 67. When creating multipart formposts. The file name part can be encoded with
   something beyond ascii but currently libcurl will only pass in the verbatim
   string the app provides. There are several browsers that already do this
   encoding. The key seems to be the updated draft to RFC2231:
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-reschke-rfc2231-in-http-02
 
 66. When using telnet, the time limitation options don't work.
-  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=846
+  https://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=846
 
 65. When doing FTP over a socks proxy or CONNECT through HTTP proxy and the
   multi interface is used, libcurl will fail if the (passive) TCP connection
   for the data transfer isn't more or less instant as the code does not
   properly wait for the connect to be confirmed. See test case 564 for a first
   shot at a test case.
 
 63. When CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY is used, the handle cannot reliably be re-used
   for any further requests or transfers. The work-around is then to close that
   handle with curl_easy_cleanup() and create a new. Some more details:
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2009-04/0300.html
+  https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2009-04/0300.html
 
 61. If an upload using Expect: 100-continue receives an HTTP 417 response,
   it ought to be automatically resent without the Expect:.  A workaround is
   for the client application to redo the transfer after disabling Expect:.
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2008-02/0043.html
+  https://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2008-02/0043.html
 
 60. libcurl closes the connection if an HTTP 401 reply is received while it
   is waiting for the the 100-continue response.

+  https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-08/0462.html
 
 58. It seems sensible to be able to use CURLOPT_NOBODY and
   CURLOPT_FAILONERROR with FTP to detect if a file exists or not, but it is
-  not working: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-07/0295.html
+  not working: https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-07/0295.html
 
 56. When libcurl sends CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE commands when connected to a SFTP
   server using the multi interface, the commands are not being sent correctly
   and instead the connection is "cancelled" (the operation is considered done)
   prematurely. There is a half-baked (busy-looping) patch provided in the bug
   report but it cannot be accepted as-is. See
-  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=748
+  https://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=748
 
 55. libcurl fails to build with MIT Kerberos for Windows (KfW) due to KfW's
   library header files exporting symbols/macros that should be kept private
   to the KfW library. See ticket #5601 at http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/
 
 52. Gautam Kachroo's issue that identifies a problem with the multi interface
   where a connection can be re-used without actually being properly
   SSL-negotiated:
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-01/0277.html
+  https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-01/0277.html
 
 49. If using --retry and the transfer timeouts (possibly due to using -m or
   -y/-Y) the next attempt doesn't resume the transfer properly from what was
   downloaded in the previous attempt but will truncate and restart at the
   original position where it was at before the previous failed attempt. See
-  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-01/0080.html and Mandriva bug report
+  https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-01/0080.html and Mandriva bug report
   https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=22565
 
 48. If a CONNECT response-headers are larger than BUFSIZE (16KB) when the
   connection is meant to be kept alive (like for NTLM proxy auth), the
   function will return prematurely and will confuse the rest of the HTTP
   protocol code. This should be very rare.
 
 43. There seems to be a problem when connecting to the Microsoft telnet server.
-  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=649
+  https://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=649
 
 41. When doing an operation over FTP that requires the ACCT command (but not
   when logging in), the operation will fail since libcurl doesn't detect this
   and thus fails to issue the correct command:

 35. Both SOCKS5 and SOCKS4 proxy connections are done blocking, which is very
   bad when used with the multi interface.
 
 34. The SOCKS4 connection codes don't properly acknowledge (connect) timeouts.
   Also see #12. According to bug #1556528, even the SOCKS5 connect code does

 31. "curl-config --libs" will include details set in LDFLAGS when configure is
   run that might be needed only for building libcurl. Further, curl-config
   --cflags suffers from the same effects with CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS.
 
 26. NTLM authentication using SSPI (on Windows) when (lib)curl is running in
   "system context" will make it use wrong(?) user name - at least when compared
-  to what winhttp does. See http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=535

   acknowledged after the actual TCP connect (during the SOCKS "negotiate"
   phase).
 
 10. To get HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication to work fine, you need to
   provide a (fake) user name (this concerns both curl and the lib) because the
   code wrongly only considers authentication if there's a user name provided.

 8. Doing resumed upload over HTTP does not work with '-C -', because curl
   doesn't do a HEAD first to get the initial size. This needs to be done
   manually for HTTP PUT resume to work, and then '-C [index]'.
 
 6. libcurl ignores empty path parts in FTP URLs, whereas RFC1738 states that

   remain even when this bug is fixed).
 
 5. libcurl doesn't treat the content-length of compressed data properly, as
   it seems HTTP servers send the *uncompressed* length in that header and
   libcurl thinks of it as the *compressed* length. Some explanations are here:

 compile OpenSSL.

 For NSS, valid examples of cipher lists include 'rsa_rc4_128_md5',

 this option then all known ciphers are disabled and only those passed in are
 enabled.

 A common technique is to use the write callback to store the incoming data
 into a dynamically growing allocated buffer, and then this
 \fICURLOPT_WRITEDATA(3)\fP is used to point to a struct or the buffer to store
 data in. Like in the getinmemory example:
