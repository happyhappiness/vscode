+  schannel: fix wildcard cert name validation on Win CE
   
-  ... and now it avoids using the libcurl toupper() function
+  Fixes a few issues in manual wildcard cert name validation in
+  schannel support code for Win32 CE:
+  - when comparing the wildcard name to the hostname, the wildcard
+    character was removed from the cert name and the hostname
+    was checked to see if it ended with the modified cert name.
+    This allowed cert names like *.com to match the connection
+    hostname. This violates recommendations from RFC 6125.
+  - when the wildcard name in the certificate is longer than the
+    connection hostname, a buffer overread of the connection
+    hostname buffer would occur during the comparison of the
+    certificate name and the connection hostname.

+  Curl_getconnectinfo: avoid checking if the connection is closed
   
-  As they are after all part of the public API. Saves space and reduces
-  complexity. Remove the strcase defines from the curlx_ family.
+  It doesn't benefit us much as the connection could get closed at
+  any time, and also by checking we lose the ability to determine
+  if the socket was closed by reading zero bytes.

+- curl.1: generated with gen.pl
   
-  follow-up to 4f8d0b6f02aa7043. Since the darwinssl code breaks
-  otherwise. If you build without darwinssl 10.5 works fine.
+  This is the first time we replace the manually edited curt.1 with the
+  generated one created by gen.pl and the individual option documentation
+  pages.
+  
+  Do not edit this file, edit the individual pages and regenerate this
+  output.
+  
+  This file will be generated by the build system soon and then removed
+  from git.
 
-- unit1301: keep testing curl_strequal
+- cmdline-opts: added some missing info
+
+- CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT.3: language
+
+- HTTPS-PROXY docs: update/polish
+
+- cmdline-opts/page-header: mention it is generated
   
-  as that is still part of the API, fix from 8fe4bd084412f30
+  ... to avoid people from trying to edit the pending curl.1 version that
+  gets generated by gen.pl
 
-- ldap: fix include
+- preproxy: renamed what was added as SOCKS_PROXY
   
-  Fix bug from 811a693b80
+  CURLOPT_SOCKS_PROXY -> CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY
+  
+  Added the corresponding --preroxy command line option. Sets a SOCKS
+  proxy to connect to _before_ connecting to a HTTP(S) proxy.
 
-- url: remove unconditional idn2.h include
+- curl: normal socks proxies still use CURLOPT_PROXY
   
-  Mistake brought by 9c91ec778104a
+  ... the newly introduced CURLOPT_SOCKS_PROXY is special and should be
+  asked for specially. (Needs new code.)
+  
+  Unified proxy type to a single variable in the config struct.
 
-- curl_strequal: part of public API/ABI, needs to be kept
+- CURLOPT_SOCKS_PROXYTYPE: removed
   
-  These two public functions have been mentioned as deprecated since a
-  very long time but since they are still part of the API and ABI we need
-  to keep them around.
+  This was added as part of the SOCKS+HTTPS proxy merge but there's no
+  need to support this as we prefer to have the protocol specified as a
+  prefix instead.
 
-- strcase: s/strequal/strcasecompare
+- curl_multi_socket.3: fix typo
+
+- checksrc: warn for assignments within if() expressions
   
-  some more follow-ups to 811a693b80
+  ... they're already frowned upon in our source code style guide, this
+  now enforces the rule harder.
 
-- ldap: fix strcase use
+- checksrc: stricter no-space-before-paren enforcement

+  openssl: don't use OpenSSL's ERR_PACK.
   
-  CVE-2016-8615
+  ERR_PACK is an internal detail of OpenSSL. Also, when using it, a
+  function name must be specified which is overly specific: the test will
+  break whenever OpenSSL internally change things so that a different
+  function creates the error.

-  Reported-by: Cure53
+  Closes #1157
 
-- strcasecompare: all case insensitive string compares ignore locale now
-  
-  We had some confusions on when each function was used. We should not act
-  differently on different locales anyway.
+Dan Fandrich (5 Dec 2016)
+- test2032: Mark test as flaky
 
-- strcasecompare: is the new name for strequal()
-  
-  ... to make it less likely that we forget that the function actually
-  does case insentive compares. Also replaced several invokes of the
-  function with a plain strcmp when case sensitivity is not an issue (like
-  comparing with "-").
+Jay Satiro (3 Dec 2016)
+- [Jeremy Pearson brought this change]
 
-- ftp: check for previous patch must be case sensitive!
+  libcurl-multi.3: typo

-- base64: check for integer overflow on large input
+- http_proxy: simplify CONNECT response reading
   
-  CVE-2016-8617
-  
-  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102C.html
-  Reported-by: Cure53
+  Since it now reads responses one byte a time, a loop could be removed
+  and it is no longer limited to get the whole response within 16K, it is
+  now instead only limited to 16K maximum header line lengths.
 
-- krb5: avoid realloc(0)
+- tests: fix CONNECT test cases to be more strict
   
-  If the requested size is zero, bail out with error instead of doing a
-  realloc() that would cause a double-free: realloc(0) acts as a free()
-  and then there's a second free in the cleanup path.
+  ... as they broke with the cleaned up CONNECT handling
+
+- CONNECT: read responses one byte at a time
   
-  CVE-2016-8619
+  ... so that it doesn't read data that is actually coming from the
+  remote. 2xx responses have no body from the proxy, that data is from the
+  peer.
   
-  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102E.html
-  Reported-by: Cure53
+  Fixes #1132
 
-- aprintf: detect wrap-around when growing allocation
-  
-  On 32bit systems we could otherwise wrap around after 2GB and allocate 0
-  bytes and crash.
+- CONNECT: reject TE or CL in 2xx responses
   
-  CVE-2016-8618
+  A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header
+  fields in a 2xx (Successful) response to CONNECT. (RFC 7231 section
+  4.3.6)
   
-  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102D.html
-  Reported-by: Cure53
+  Also fixes the three test cases that did this.
 
-- range: reject char globs with missing end like '[L-]'
+- URL parser: reject non-numerical port numbers

+Michael Kaufmann (30 Nov 2016)
+- CURLOPT_CONNECT_TO: Skip non-matching "connect-to" entries properly
   
-  CVE-2016-8620

-  - Warn if OpenSSL is not present.
+  Adds access to the effectively used protocol/scheme to both libcurl and
+  curl, both in string and numeric (CURLPROTO_*) form.
   
-  - Use a UTF-8 stream to make the ca-bundle data.
+  Note that the string form will be uppercase, as it is just the internal
+  string.
   
-  - Save the UTF-8 ca-bundle stream as binary so that no BOM is added.
+  As these strings are declared internally as const, and all other strings
+  returned by curl_easy_getinfo() are de-facto const as well, string
+  handling in getinfo.c got const-ified.
   
-  ---
-  
-  This is a follow-up to d2c6d15 which switched mk-ca-bundle.vbs output to
-  ANSI due to corrupt UTF-8 output, now fixed.
-  
-  This change completes making the default certificate bundle output of

-
-Jay Satiro (25 Oct 2016)
-- mk-ca-bundle: Update the vbscript version
+  An HTTPS proxy receives all transactions over an SSL/TLS connection.
+  Once a secure connection with the proxy is established, the user agent
+  uses the proxy as usual, including sending CONNECT requests to instruct
+  the proxy to establish a [usually secure] TCP tunnel with an origin
+  server. HTTPS proxies protect nearly all aspects of user-proxy
+  communications as opposed to HTTP proxies that receive all requests
+  (including CONNECT requests) in vulnerable clear text.
   
-  Bring the VBScript version more in line with the perl version:
+  With HTTPS proxies, it is possible to have two concurrent _nested_
+  SSL/TLS sessions: the "outer" one between the user agent and the proxy
+  and the "inner" one between the user agent and the origin server
+  (through the proxy). This change adds supports for such nested sessions
+  as well.
   
-  - Change timestamp to UTC.
+  A secure connection with a proxy requires its own set of the usual SSL
+  options (their actual descriptions differ and need polishing, see TODO):
   
-  - Change URL retrieval to HTTPS-only by default.
+    --proxy-cacert FILE        CA certificate to verify peer against
+    --proxy-capath DIR         CA directory to verify peer against
+    --proxy-cert CERT[:PASSWD] Client certificate file and password
+    --proxy-cert-type TYPE     Certificate file type (DER/PEM/ENG)
+    --proxy-ciphers LIST       SSL ciphers to use
+    --proxy-crlfile FILE       Get a CRL list in PEM format from the file
+    --proxy-insecure           Allow connections to proxies with bad certs
+    --proxy-key KEY            Private key file name
+    --proxy-key-type TYPE      Private key file type (DER/PEM/ENG)
+    --proxy-pass PASS          Pass phrase for the private key
+    --proxy-ssl-allow-beast    Allow security flaw to improve interop
+    --proxy-sslv2              Use SSLv2
+    --proxy-sslv3              Use SSLv3
+    --proxy-tlsv1              Use TLSv1
+    --proxy-tlsuser USER       TLS username
+    --proxy-tlspassword STRING TLS password
+    --proxy-tlsauthtype STRING TLS authentication type (default SRP)
   
-  - Comment out the options that disabled SSL cert checking by default.
+  All --proxy-foo options are independent from their --foo counterparts,
+  except --proxy-crlfile which defaults to --crlfile and --proxy-capath
+  which defaults to --capath.
   
-  - Assume OpenSSL is present, get SHA256. And add a flag to toggle it.
+  Curl now also supports %{proxy_ssl_verify_result} --write-out variable,
+  similar to the existing %{ssl_verify_result} variable.
   
-  - Fix cert issuer name output.
+  Supported backends: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and NSS.
   
-  The cert issuer output is now ansi, converted from UTF-8. Prior to this
-  it was corrupt UTF-8. It turns out though we can work with UTF-8 the
-  FSO object that writes ca-bundle can't write UTF-8, so there will have
-  to be some alternative if UTF-8 is needed (like an ADODB.Stream).
+  * A SOCKS proxy + HTTP/HTTPS proxy combination:
   
-  - Disable the certificate text info feature.
+  If both --socks* and --proxy options are given, Curl first connects to
+  the SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS
+  proxy.
   
-  The certificate text info doesn't work properly with any recent OpenSSL.
+  TODO: Update documentation for the new APIs and --proxy-* options.
+  Look for "Added in 7.XXX" marks.

-  ... since if it fails to init the entire array and then tries to clean

-- select: switch to macros in uppercase
+- URL-parser: for file://[host]/ URLs, the [host] must be localhost
   
-  Curl_select_ready() was the former API that was replaced with
-  Curl_select_check() a while back and the former arg setup was provided
-  with a define (in order to leave existing code unmodified).
+  Previously, the [host] part was just ignored which made libcurl accept
+  strange URLs misleading users. like "file://etc/passwd" which might've
+  looked like it refers to "/etc/passwd" but is just "/passwd" since the
+  "etc" is an ignored host name.
   
-  Now we instead offer SOCKET_READABLE and SOCKET_WRITABLE for the most
-  common shortcuts where only one socket is checked. They're also more
-  visibly macros.
+  Reported-by: Mike Crowe
+  Assisted-by: Kamil Dudka
 
-- select: use more proper macro-looking names
-  
-  ... so that it becomes more obvious in the code what is what. Also added
-  a typecast for one of the calculations.

-
-  speed caps: not based on average speeds anymore
-  
-  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
-  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
-  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
-  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
-  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
-  bursts" (as told in man page).
-  
-  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
-  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
-  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
-  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
-  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
-  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
-  
-  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
-  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
-  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
-  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
-  case of sudden speed burst).

-  ftp: fix wrong poll on the secondary socket
-  
-  When we're uploading using FTP and the server issues a tiny pause
-  between opening the connection to the client's secondary socket, the
-  client's initial poll() times out, which leads to second poll() which
-  does not wait for POLLIN on the secondary socket. So that poll() also
-  has to time out, creating a long (200ms) pause.
-  
-  This patch adds the correct flag to the secondary socket, making the
-  second poll() correctly wait for the connection there too.

-  curl: allow "pkcs11:" prefix for client certificates
-  
-  RFC7512 provides a standard method to reference certificates in PKCS#11
-  tokens, by means of a URI starting 'pkcs11:'.
-  
-  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
-  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
-  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
-  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.
-  
-  This doesn't work with cURL because of the way that the colon is used
-  to separate the certificate argument from the passphrase. So instead of
+- configure: set min version flags for builds on mac
   
-     curl -E 'pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  This helps building binaries that can work on multiple macOS versions.
   
-  I instead need to invoke cURL with the colon escaped, like this:
+  Help-by: Martin Storsjö
   
-     curl -E 'pkcs11\:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  Fixes #1069
+
+- curl_multi_add_handle: set timeouts in closure handles
   
-  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
-  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
-  differences for different applications.
+  The closure handle only ever has default timeouts set. To improve the
+  state somewhat we clone the timeouts from each added handle so that the
+  closure handle always has the same timeouts as the most recently added
+  easy handle.
   
-  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
-  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
-  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
-  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
-  the URI itself.
+  Fixes #739
+
+- configure/CURL_CHECK_FUNC_POLL: disable poll completely on mac
   
-  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
-  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
-  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
-  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
+  ... so that the same libcurl build easier can run on any version.
   
-  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
-  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
-  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
-  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

+- curl: set INTERLEAVEDATA too

-- HTTP: retry failed HEAD requests too
+  This fixes a merge error in commit 7f3df80 caused by commit 332e8d6.
   
-  Mark's new document about HTTP Retries
-  (https://mnot.github.io/I-D/httpbis-retry/) made me check our code and I
-  spotted that we don't retry failed HEAD requests which seems totally
-  inconsistent and I can't see any reason for that separate treatment.
+  Additionally, this changes Curl_verify_windows_version for Windows App
+  builds to assume to always be running on the target Windows version.
+  There seems to be no way to determine the Windows version from a
+  UWP app. Neither GetVersion(Ex), nor VerifyVersionInfo, nor the
+  Version Helper functions are supported.
   
-  So, no separate treatment for HEAD starting now. A HTTP request sent
-  over a reused connection that gets cut off before a single byte is
-  received will be retried on a fresh connection.

-  rtsp: accept any RTSP session id
-  
-  Makes libcurl work in communication with gstreamer-based RTSP
-  servers. The original code validates the session id to be in accordance
-  with the RFC. I think it is better not to do that:
-  
-  - For curl the actual content is a don't care.
-  
-  - The clarity of the RFC is debatable, is $ allowed or only as \$, that
-    is imho not clear
+  url: skip to-be-closed connections when pipelining
   
-  - Gstreamer seems to url-encode the session id but % is not allowed by
-  the RFC
+  No longer attempt to use "doomed" to-be-closed connections when
+  pipelining. Prior to this change connections marked for deletion (e.g.
+  timeout) would be erroneously used, resulting in sporadic crashes.
   
-  - less code
+  As originally reported and fixed by Carlo Wood (origin unknown).

-  order to make debugging work, and explains the possible debug levels.
+  ... it no longer takes printf() arguments since it was only really taken
+  advantage by one user and it was not written and used in a safe
+  way. Thus the 'f' is removed from the function name and the proto is
+  changed.
+

-- CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY: now enabled by default

-  After a few wasted hours hunting down the reason for slowness during a

-  set, I think we have enough motivation to toggle the default for this
-  option. We now enable TCP_NODELAY by default and allow applications to
-  switch it off.
+  The previous use of snprintf() could make libcurl silently truncate some
+  input data and not report that back on overly large input, which could
+  make data get sent over the network in a bad format.
   
-  This also makes --tcp-nodelay unnecessary, but --no-tcp-nodelay can be
-  used to disable it.

+Michael Kaufmann (22 Sep 2016)
+- New libcurl option to keep sending on error
   
-  Many applications assume the actual contents of the public types and use
-  that do for example forward declarations (saving them from including our
-  public header) which then breaks when we switch from void * to a struct
-  *.
+  Add the new option CURLOPT_KEEP_SENDING_ON_ERROR to control whether
+  sending the request body shall be completed when the server responds
+  early with an error status code.
   
-  I'm not convinced we were wrong, but since this practise seems
-  widespread enough I'm willing to (partly) step down.
+  This is suitable for manual NTLM authentication.
   
-  Now libcurl uses the struct itself when it is built and it allows
-  applications to use the struct type if CURL_STRICTER is defined at the
-  time of the #include.

+  openssl: fix CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT
   
-  Prior to this change we called Curl_ssl_getsessionid and
-  Curl_ssl_addsessionid regardless of whether session ID reusing was
-  enabled. According to comments that is in case session ID reuse was
-  disabled but then later enabled.
+  CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT does not get the certificate verification
+  result when SSL_connect fails because of a certificate verification
+  error.
   
-  The old way was not intuitive and probably not something users expected.
-  When a user disables session ID caching I'd guess they don't expect the
-  session ID to be cached anyway in case the caching is later enabled.
+  This fix saves the result of SSL_get_verify_result so that it is
+  returned by CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT.

-- curl-compilers.m4: improve detection of GCC's -fvisibility= flag
-  
-  Some builds of GCC produce output on both stdout and stderr when --help
-  --verbose is used.  The 2>&1 redirection caused them to be arbitrarily
-  interleaved with each other because of stream buffering.  Consequently,
-  grep failed to match the fvisibility= string in the mixed output, even
-  though the string was present in GCC's standard output.
-  
-  This led to silently disabling symbol hiding in some builds of curl.

-- tests: fix the HTTP/2 tests
-  
-  The HTTP/2 tests brought with commit bf05606ef1f were using the internal
-  name 'http2' for the HTTP/2 server, while in fact that name was already
-  used for the second instance of the HTTP server. This made tests using
-  the second instance (like test 2050) fail after a HTTP/2 test had run.
-  
-  The server is now known as HTTP/2 internally and within the <server>
-  section in test cases. 1700, 1701 and 1702 were updated accordingly.

-- openssl: fix cert check with non-DNS name fields present
+  speed caps: not based on average speeds anymore
   
-  Regression introduced in 5f5b62635 (released in 7.48.0)
+  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
+  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
+  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
+  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
+  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
+  bursts" (as told in man page).
   
-  Reported-by: Fabian Ruff
-  Fixes #875
+  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
+  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
+  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
+  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
+  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
+  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
+  
+  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
+  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
+  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
+  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
+  case of sudden speed burst).
+  
+  Closes #971

+
+  ftp: fix wrong poll on the secondary socket
   
-  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
-  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
-  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
-  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
-  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
-  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
-  This commit:
-   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
-     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
-   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
-     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
-   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
-     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
-     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
-     this race.
+  When we're uploading using FTP and the server issues a tiny pause
+  between opening the connection to the client's secondary socket, the
+  client's initial poll() times out, which leads to second poll() which
+  does not wait for POLLIN on the secondary socket. So that poll() also
+  has to time out, creating a long (200ms) pause.
   
-  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/815
-  Fixes #815
-  Closes #847
+  This patch adds the correct flag to the secondary socket, making the
+  second poll() correctly wait for the connection there too.

-  loadlibrary: Only load system DLLs from the system directory
+  curl: allow "pkcs11:" prefix for client certificates
   
-  Inspiration provided by: Daniel Stenberg and Ray Satiro
+  RFC7512 provides a standard method to reference certificates in PKCS#11
+  tokens, by means of a URI starting 'pkcs11:'.
   
-  Bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20160530.html
+  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
+  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
+  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
+  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.
   
-  Ref: Windows DLL hijacking with curl, CVE-2016-4802
+  This doesn't work with cURL because of the way that the colon is used
+  to separate the certificate argument from the passphrase. So instead of
+  
+     curl -E 'pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  
+  I instead need to invoke cURL with the colon escaped, like this:
+  
+     curl -E 'pkcs11\:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  
+  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
+  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
+  differences for different applications.
+  
+  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
+  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
+  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
+  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
+  the URI itself.
+  
+  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
+  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
+  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
+  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
+  
+  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
+  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
+  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
+  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

+- http2: always wait for readable socket
   
-  Because the old OpenSSL link now redirects to their master documentation
-  (currently 1.1.0), which does not document the required actions for
-  OpenSSL <= 1.0.2.
+  Since the server can at any time send a HTTP/2 frame to us, we need to
+  wait for the socket to be readable during all transfers so that we can
+  act on incoming frames even when uploading etc.

-  "%0*d%s", 2, 9, "foo"

+- multi: make Curl_expire() work with 0 ms timeouts
+  
+  Previously, passing a timeout of zero to Curl_expire() was a magic code
+  for clearing all timeouts for the handle. That is now instead made with
+  the new Curl_expire_clear() function and thus a 0 timeout is fine to set
+  and will trigger a timeout ASAP.
+  
+  This will help removing short delays, in particular notable when doing
+  HTTP/2.
 
-  darwinssl: fix certificate verification disable on OS X 10.8
+- transfer: return without select when the read loop reached maxcount
   
-  The new way of disabling certificate verification doesn't work on
-  Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) so we need to use the old way in that version
-  too. I've tested this solution on versions 10.7.5, 10.8, 10.9, 10.10.2
-  and 10.11.
+  Regression added in 790d6de48515. The was then added to avoid one
+  particular transfer to starve out others. But when aborting due to
+  reading the maxcount, the connection must be marked to be read from
+  again without first doing a select as for some protocols (like SFTP/SCP)
+  the data may already have been read off the socket.

-  TLS: SSL_peek is not a const operation
+  travis: fix OSX build by re-installing libtool
   
-  Calling SSL_peek can cause bytes to be read from the raw socket which in
-  turn can upset the select machinery that determines whether there's data
-  available on the socket.
+  Apparently due to a broken homebrew install
   
-  Since Curl_ossl_check_cxn only tries to determine whether the socket is
-  alive and doesn't actually need to see the bytes SSL_peek seems like
-  the wrong function to call.

+  win32: fix a potential memory leak in Curl_load_library
   
-  We're able to occasionally reproduce a connect timeout due to this
-  bug. What happens is that Curl doesn't know to call SSL_connect again
-  after the peek happens since data is buffered in the SSL buffer and thus
-  select won't fire for this socket.
+  If a call to GetSystemDirectory fails, the `path` pointer that was

-  TLS: move the ALPN/NPN enable bits to the connection
+- include: revert 9adf3c4 and make public types void * again
   
-  Only protocols that actually have a protocol registered for ALPN and NPN
-  should try to get that negotiated in the TLS handshake. That is only
-  HTTPS (well, http/1.1 and http/2) right now. Previously ALPN and NPN
-  would wrongly be used in all handshakes if libcurl was built with it
-  enabled.
+  Many applications assume the actual contents of the public types and use
+  that do for example forward declarations (saving them from including our
+  public header) which then breaks when we switch from void * to a struct
+  *.
   
-  Reported-by: Jay Satiro
+  I'm not convinced we were wrong, but since this practise seems
+  widespread enough I'm willing to (partly) step down.
+  
+  Now libcurl uses the struct itself when it is built and it allows
+  applications to use the struct type if CURL_STRICTER is defined at the
+  time of the #include.

-  connect: fix invalid "Network is unreachable" errors

-  (intermittently) even if the ipv4 socket connects successfully.
+  cmake: Fix for schannel support

-  OpenSSL 1.1.0-pre seems to return NULL(?) for a whole lot of those
-  numbers so make sure the function handles this.
+  Some builds of GCC produce output on both stdout and stderr when --help
+  --verbose is used.  The 2>&1 redirection caused them to be arbitrarily

+- http2-tests: test1700 is the first real HTTP/2 test

-  AC_CHECK_FUNC(gethostbyname...) will no longer spuriously succeed after
-  the first configure run with caching.
+  It requires that 'nghttpx' is in the PATH, and it will run the tests
+  using nghttpx as a front-end proxy in front of the standard HTTP/1 test
+  server. This uses HTTP/2 over plain TCP.
   
-  `ac_cv_func_strcasecmp` is curious, see #770.
+  If you like me have nghttpx installed in a custom path, you can run test 1700
+  like this:
   
-  `eval "ac_cv_func_$func=yes"` can still cause problems as it works in
-  tandem with AC_CHECK_FUNCS and then potentially modifies its result. It
-  would be best to rewrite this test to use a new CURL_CHECK_FUNCS macro,
-  which works the same as AC_CHECK_FUNCS but relies on caching the values
-  of curl_cv_func_* variables, without modifiying ac_cv_func_*.

-- vtls.h: remove a space before semicolon
+  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
+  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
+  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
+  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
+  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
+  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
+  This commit:
+   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
+     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
+   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
+     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
+   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
+     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
+     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
+     this race.

+Jay Satiro (23 May 2016)
+- contributors: Show GitHub username if real name unknown
   
-  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
-  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into
-  http_conn.drain_total.  We only shutdown session if that value is 0.
+  Prior to this change if a GitHub contributor's real name was unknown
+  they would be omitted from the list.
   
-  With this commit, when stream was closed before reading response
-  header fields, error code CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM is returned even if
-  HTTP/2 level error is NO_ERROR.  This signals the upper layer that
-  stream was closed by error just like TCP connection close in HTTP/1.

-  curl.1: change example for -F
+  http2: Add space between colon and header value
   
-  It's a bad idea to send your passwords anywhere, especially over HTTP.
-  Modified example to send a picture instead.
+  curl's representation of HTTP/2 responses involves transforming the
+  response to a format that is similar to HTTP/1.1. Prior to this change,
+  curl would do this by separating header names and values with only a
+  colon, without introducing a space after the colon.
   
-  Fixes #752
-
-- KNOWN_BUGS: reorganized and cleaned up
+  While this is technically a valid way to represent a HTTP/1.1 header
+  block, it is much more common to see a space following the colon. This
+  change introduces that space, to ensure that incautious tools are safely
+  able to parse the header block.
   
-  Now sorted into categories and organized in the same style we do the
-  TODO document. It will make each issue linked properly on the
-  https://curl.haxx.se/docs/knownbugs.html web page.
+  This also ensures that the difference between the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
+  response layout is as minimal as possible.
   
-  The sections should make it easier to find issues and issues related to
-  areas of the reader's specific interest.

-- http2: fix connection reuse when PING comes after last DATA
-  
-  It turns out the google GFE HTTP/2 servers send a PING frame immediately
-  after a stream ends and its last DATA has been received by curl. So if

+  (intermittently) even if the ipv4 socket connects successfully.
+  
+  This happens because there's a for-loop that iterates on the sockets but
+  the error variable is not resetted when the ipv4 is checked and is ok.
+  
+  This patch fixes this problem by setting error to 0 when checking the
+  second socket and not having a result yet.

+- tool_cb_hdr: Fix --remote-header-name with schemeless URL
   
-  Although this should never happen due to the relationship between the
-  'mech' and 'resp' variables, and the way they are allocated together,
-  it does cause problems for code analysis tools:
+  - Move the existing scheme check from tool_operate.
   
-  V595 The 'mech' pointer was utilized before it was verified against
-       nullptr. Check lines: 376, 381. curl_sasl.c 376
+  In the case of --remote-header-name we want to parse Content-disposition
+  for a filename, but only if the scheme is http or https. A recent
+  adjustment 0dc4d8e was made to account for schemeless URLs however it's
+  not 100% accurate. To remedy that I've moved the scheme check to the
+  header callback, since at that point the library has already determined
+  the scheme.

+  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
+  
+  This commit ensures that streams which was closed in on_stream_close
+  callback gets passed to http2_handle_stream_close.  Previously, this
+  might not happen.  To achieve this, we increment drain property to
+  forcibly call recv function for that stream.
+  
+  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
+  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into
+  http_conn.drain_total.  We only shutdown session if that value is 0.
+  
+  With this commit, when stream was closed before reading response
+  header fields, error code CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM is returned even if
+  HTTP/2 level error is NO_ERROR.  This signals the upper layer that
+  stream was closed by error just like TCP connection close in HTTP/1.

+  HTTP2: Add a space character after the status code
   
-  Since gcc 5, the processor output can get split up on multiple lines
-  that made the configure script fail to figure out values from
-  definitions. The fix is to use cpp -P, and this fix now first checks if
-  cpp -P is necessary and then if cpp -P works before it uses that to
-  extract defined values.
+  The space character after the status code is mandatory, even if the

-- formdata.c: Fixed compilation warning
-  
-  formdata.c:390: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
-  
-  Introduced in commit ca5f9341ef this happens because a char*, which is
-  32-bits wide in 32-bit land, is being cast to a curl_off_t which is
-  64-bits wide where 64-bit integers are supported by the compiler.
-  
-  This doesn't happen in 64-bit land as a pointer is the same size as a
-  curl_off_t.

+- curl_sasl: Fixed potential null pointer utilisation
   
-  libcurl previously had a more liberal approach which causes significant
-  problems when introducing new cookie parameters, like the suggested new
-  cookie priority draft.
+  Although this should never happen due to the relationship between the
+  'mech' and 'resp' variables, and the way they are allocated together,
+  it does cause problems for code analysis tools:
   
-  The previous logic read all n/v pairs from left-to-right and the first
-  name used that wassn't a known parameter name would be used as the
-  cookie name, thus accepting "Set-Cookie: Max-Age=2; person=daniel" to be
-  a cookie named 'person' while an RFC 6265 compliant parser should
-  consider that to be a cookie named 'Max-Age' with an (unknown) parameter
-  'person'.
+  V595 The 'mech' pointer was utilized before it was verified against
+       nullptr. Check lines: 376, 381. curl_sasl.c 376

+  and SSLv3 are disabled by default at build time, but we can use both.
   
-  ... as when pipelining is used, we read things into a unified buffer and
-  we don't do that with HTTP/2. This could then easily make programs that
-  set CURLMOPT_PIPELINING = CURLPIPE_HTTP1|CURLPIPE_MULTIPLEX to get data
-  intermixed or plain broken between HTTP/2 streams.

-  openssl: remove most BoringSSL #ifdefs.
-  
-  As of https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/#/c/6980/, almost all of
-  BoringSSL #ifdefs in cURL should be unnecessary:
-  
-  - BoringSSL provides no-op stubs for compatibility which replaces most
-    #ifdefs.

+- build-wolfssl: Update VS properties for wolfSSL v3.9.0
   
-  - DES_set_odd_parity has been in BoringSSL for nearly a year now. Remove
-    the compatibility codepath.
+  - Do not use wolfSSL's sample user-setting files.
   
-  - With a small tweak to an extend_key_56_to_64 call, the NTLM code
-    builds fine.
+  wolfSSL starting in v3.9.0 has added their own sample user settings that
+  are applied by default, but we don't use them because we have our own
+  settings.
   
-  - Switch OCSP-related #ifdefs to the more generally useful
-    OPENSSL_NO_OCSP.
+  - Do not use wolfSSL's Visual Studio Unicode character setting.
   
-  The only #ifdefs which remain are Curl_ossl_version and the #undefs to
-  work around OpenSSL and wincrypt.h name conflicts. (BoringSSL leaves
-  that to the consumer. The in-header workaround makes things sensitive to
-  include order.)
+  wolfSSL Visual Studio projects use the Unicode character set however our
+  settings and options imitate mingw build which does not use the Unicode
+  character set. This does not appear to have any effect at the moment but
+  better safe than sorry.
   
-  This change errs on the side of removing conditionals despite many of
-  the restored codepaths being no-ops. (BoringSSL generally adds no-op
-  compatibility stubs when possible. OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER #ifdefs are
-  bad enough!)
   
-  Closes #640

-- dotdot: allow an empty input string too
+  Introduced in commit ca5f9341ef this happens because a char*, which is

+  64-bits wide where 64-bit integers are supported by the compiler.
   
-  It isn't used by the code in current conditions but for safety it seems
-  sensible to at least not crash on such input.
+  This doesn't happen in 64-bit land as a pointer is the same size as a
+  curl_off_t.
   
-  Extended unit test 1395 to verify this too as well as a plain "/" input.
+  This fix doesn't address the fact that a 64-bit value cannot be used
+  for CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN when set in a form array and compiled on a
+  32-bit platforms, it does at least suppress the compilation warning.

-  
-  - Switch from verifying a pinned public key in a callback during the
-  certificate verification to inline after the certificate verification.
-  
-  The callback method had three problems:
-  
-  1. If a pinned public key didn't match, CURLE_SSL_PINNEDPUBKEYNOTMATCH
-  was not returned.
-  
-  2. If peer certificate verification was disabled the pinned key
-  verification did not take place as it should.
-  
-  3. (related to #2) If there was no certificate of depth 0 the callback
-  would not have checked the pinned public key.
-  
-  Though all those problems could have been fixed it would have made the
-  code more complex. Instead we now verify inline after the certificate
-  verification in mbedtls_connect_step2.

   what you can do to help them fix the problem.

   please convert your program over to plain C and follow the steps outlined
   above.
+
+2. Bug fixing procedure
+
+2.1 What happens on first filing
+
+  When a new issue is posted in the issue tracker or on the mailing list, the
+  team of developers first need to see the report. Maybe they took the day
+  off, maybe they're off in the woods hunting. Have patience. Allow at least a
+  few days before expecting someone to have responded.
+
+  In the issue tracker you can expect that some labels will be set on the
+  issue to help categorize it.
+
+2.2 First response
+
+  If your issue/bug report wasn't perfect at once (and few are), chances are
+  that someone will ask follow-up questions. Which version did you use? Which
+  options did you use? How often does the problem occur? How can we reproduce
+  this problem? Which protocols does it involve? Or perhaps much more specific
+  and deep diving questions. It all depends on your specific issue.
+
+  You should then respond to these follow-up questions and provide more info
+  about the problem, so that we can help you figure it out. Or maybe you can
+  help us figure it out. An active back-and-forth communication is important
+  and the key for finding a cure and landing a fix.
+
+2.3 Not reproducible
+
+  For problems that we can't reproduce and can't understand even after having
+  gotten all the info we need and having studied the source code over again,
+  are really hard to solve so then we may require further work from you who
+  actually see or experience the problem.
+
+2.4 Unresponsive
+
+  If the problem haven't been understood or reproduced, and there's nobody
+  responding to follow-up questions or questions asking for clarifications or
+  for discussing possible ways to move forward with the task, we take that as
+  a strong suggestion that the bug is not important.
+
+  Unimportant issues will be closed as inactive sooner or later as they can't
+  be fixed. The inactivity period (waiting for responses) should not be
+  shorter than two weeks but may extend months.
+
+2.5 Lack of time/interest
+
+  Bugs that are filed and are understood can unfortunately end up in the
+  "nobody cares enough about it to work on it" category. Such bugs are
+  perfectly valid problems that *should* get fixed but apparently aren't. We
+  try to mark such bugs as "KNOWN_BUGS material" after a time of inactivity
+  and if no activity is noticed after yet some time those bugs are added to
+  KNOWN_BUGS and are closed in the issue tracker.
+
+2.6 KNOWN_BUGS
+
+  This is a list of known bugs. Bugs we know exist and that have been pointed
+  out but that haven't yet been fixed. The reasons for why they haven't been
+  fixed can involve anything really, but the primary reason is that nobody has
+  considered these problems to be important enough to spend the necesary time
+  and effort to have them fixed.
+
+  The KNOWN_BUGS are always up for grabs and we will always love the ones who
+  bring one of them back to live and offers solutions to them.
+
+  The KNOWN_BUGS document has a sibling document known as TODO.
+
+2.7 TODO
+
+  Issues that are filed or reported that aren't really bugs but more missing
+  features or ideas for future improvements and so on are marked as
+  'enhancement' or 'feature-request' and will be added to the TODO document
+  instead and the issue is closed. We don't keep TODO items in the issue
+  tracker.
+
+  The TODO document is full of ideas and suggestions of what we can add or fix
+  one day. You're always encouraged and free to grab one of those items and
+  take up a discussion with the curl development team on how that could be
+  implemented or provided in the project so that you can work on ticking it
+  odd that document.
+
+  If the issue is rather a bug and not a missing feature or functionality, it
+  is listed in KNOWN_BUGS instead.
+
+2.8 Closing off stalled bugs
+
+  The issue and pull request trackers on https://github.com/curl/curl will
+  only hold "active" entries (using a non-precise defintion of what active
+  actually is, but they're at least not completely dead). Those that are
+  abandonded or in other ways dormant will be closed and sometimes added to
+  TODO and KNOWN_BUGS instead.
+
+  This way, we only have "active" issues open on github. Irrelevant issues and
+  pull requests will not distract developes or casual visitors.

 .SH OPTIONS
 Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an
 additional value next to them.
 
 The short "single-dash" form of the options, -d for example, may be used with
 or without a space between it and its value, although a space is a recommended
-separator. The long "double-dash" form, --data for example, requires a space
+separator. The long "double-dash" form, \fI-d, --data\fP for example, requires a space
 between it and its value.
 
 Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used
 immediately next to each other, like for example you can specify all the
 options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.
 
 In general, all boolean options are enabled with --\fBoption\fP and yet again
 disabled with --\fBno-\fPoption. That is, you use the exact same option name
 but prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we mostly only list and show
 the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was added in
 7.19.0. Previously most options were toggled on/off on repeated use of the
 same command line option.)
-.IP "-#, --progress-bar"
-Make curl display progress as a simple progress bar instead of the standard,
-more informational, meter.
-.IP "-:, --next"
-Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and associated
-options. This allows you to send several URL requests, each with their own
-specific options, for example, such as different user names or custom requests
-for each. (Added in 7.36.0)
-.IP "-0, --http1.0"
-(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its internally
-preferred: HTTP 1.1.
-.IP "--http1.1"
-(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1. This is the internal default
-version. (Added in 7.33.0)
-.IP "--http2"
-(HTTP) Tells curl to issue its requests using HTTP 2. This requires that the
-underlying libcurl was built to support it. (Added in 7.33.0)
-.IP "--http2-prior-knowledge"
-(HTTP) Tells curl to issue its non-TLS HTTP requests using HTTP/2 without
-HTTP/1.1 Upgrade. It requires prior knowledge that the server supports HTTP/2
-straight away. HTTPS requests will still do HTTP/2 the standard way with
-negotiated protocol version in the TLS handshake.
-
-HTTP/2 support in general also requires that the underlying libcurl was built
-to support it. (Added in 7.49.0)
-.IP "--no-npn"
-Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default if libcurl was built
-with an SSL library that supports NPN. NPN is used by a libcurl that supports
-HTTP 2 to negotiate HTTP 2 support with the server during https sessions.
+.IP "--anyauth"
+(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the most
+secure one the remote site claims to support. This is done by first doing a
+request and checking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing an extra
+network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a specific authentication
+method, which you can do with \fI--basic\fP, \fI--digest\fP, \fI--ntlm\fP, and \fI--negotiate\fP.
+
+Using \fI--anyauth\fP is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin, since it may
+require data to be sent twice and then the client must be able to rewind. If
+the need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload operation will
+fail.

-.IP "--no-alpn"
-Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by default if libcurl was built
-with an SSL library that supports ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports
-HTTP 2 to negotiate HTTP 2 support with the server during https sessions.

-(Added in 7.36.0)
-.IP "-1, --tlsv1"
-(SSL)
-Forces curl to use TLS version 1.x when negotiating with a remote TLS server.
-You can use options \fI--tlsv1.0\fP, \fI--tlsv1.1\fP, and \fI--tlsv1.2\fP to
-control the TLS version more precisely (if the SSL backend in use supports such
-a level of control).
-.IP "-2, --sslv2"
-(SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiating with a remote SSL
-server. Sometimes curl is built without SSLv2 support. SSLv2 is widely
-considered insecure (see RFC 6176).
-.IP "-3, --sslv3"
-(SSL) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when negotiating with a remote SSL
-server. Sometimes curl is built without SSLv3 support. SSLv3 is widely
-considered insecure (see RFC 7568).
-.IP "-4, --ipv4"
-This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses only, and not for
-example try IPv6.
-.IP "-6, --ipv6"
-This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses only, and not for
-example try IPv4.
+See also \fI--proxy-anyauth\fP and \fI--basic\fP and \fI--digest\fP.
 .IP "-a, --append"
-(FTP/SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the target file
-instead of overwriting it. If the remote file doesn't exist, it will be
-created.  Note that this flag is ignored by some SFTP servers (including
-OpenSSH).
-.IP "-A, --user-agent <agent string>"
-(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly
-done CGIs fail if this field isn't set to "Mozilla/4.0". To encode blanks in
-the string, surround the string with single quote marks. This can also be set
-with the \fI-H, --header\fP option of course.
+(FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the target file instead of
+overwriting it. If the remote file doesn't exist, it will be created.  Note
+that this flag is ignored by some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).
+.IP "--basic"
+(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the remote host. This is the
+default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use it to override a
+previously set option that sets a different authentication method (such as
+\fI--ntlm\fP, \fI--digest\fP, or \fI--negotiate\fP).
 
-If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
-.IP "--anyauth"
-(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the
-most secure one the remote site claims to support. This is done by first
-doing a request and checking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing an
-extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a specific

-Note that using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,
-since it may require data to be sent twice and then the client must be able to
-rewind. If the need should arise when uploading from stdin, the upload
-operation will fail.
-.IP "-b, --cookie <name=data>"
-(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data
-previously received from the server in a "Set-Cookie:" line.  The data should
-be in the format "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".
-
-If no '=' symbol is used in the line, it is treated as a filename to use to
-read previously stored cookie lines from, which should be used in this session
-if they match. Using this method also activates the cookie engine which will
-make curl record incoming cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this
-in combination with the \fI-L, --location\fP option. The file format of the
-file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or
-the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.
+Used together with \fI-u, --user\fP.
 
-The file specified with \fI-b, --cookie\fP is only used as input. No cookies
-will be written to the file. To store cookies, use the \fI-c, --cookie-jar\fP
-option.
+See also \fI--proxy-basic\fP.
+.IP "--cacert <CA certificate>"
+(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The file
+may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM
+format. Normally curl is built to use a default file for this, so this option
+is typically used to alter that default file.
+
+curl recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is
+set, and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This option
+overrides that variable.
+
+The windows version of curl will automatically look for a CA certs file named
+\'curl-ca-bundle.crt\', either in the same directory as curl.exe, or in the
+Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your PATH.
+
+If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module
+(libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this option to work properly.
 
-Exercise caution if you are using this option and multiple transfers may occur.
-If you use the NAME1=VALUE1; format, or in a file use the Set-Cookie format and
-don't specify a domain, then the cookie is sent for any domain (even after
-redirects are followed) and cannot be modified by a server-set cookie. If the
-cookie engine is enabled and a server sets a cookie of the same name then both
-will be sent on a future transfer to that server, likely not what you intended.
-To address these issues set a domain in Set-Cookie (doing that will include
-sub-domains) or use the Netscape format.
+(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then this
+option is supported for backward compatibility with other SSL engines, but it
+should not be set. If the option is not set, then curl will use the
+certificates in the system and user Keychain to verify the peer, which is the
+preferred method of verifying the peer's certificate chain.
 
 If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
-.IP "-B, --use-ascii"
-(FTP/LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be enforced by using
-an URL that ends with ";type=A". This option causes data sent to stdout to be
-in text mode for win32 systems.
-.IP "--basic"
-(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the remote host. This
-is the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use it to
-override a previously set option that sets a different authentication method
-(such as \fI--ntlm\fP, \fI--digest\fP, or \fI--negotiate\fP).
+.IP "--capath <dir>"
+(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the
+peer. Multiple paths can be provided by separating them with ":" (e.g.
+\&"path1:path2:path3"). The certificates must be in PEM format, and if curl is
+built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been processed using the
+c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using \fI--capath\fP can allow
+OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections much more efficiently than using
+\fI--cacert\fP if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.
 
-Used together with \fI-u, --user\fP and \fI-x, --proxy\fP.
+If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored, and if it is
+used several times, the last one will be used.
+.IP "--cert-status"
+(TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server certificate by using the
+Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS extension.
 
-See also \fI--proxy-basic\fP.
-.IP "-c, --cookie-jar <file name>"
-(HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a
-completed operation. Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified
-file as well as all cookies received from remote server(s). If no cookies are
-known, no data will be written. The file will be written using the Netscape
-cookie file format. If you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the
-cookies will be written to stdout.
+If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid (e.g. expired)
+response, if the response suggests that the server certificate has been revoked,
+or no response at all is received, the verification fails.
 
-This command line option will activate the cookie engine that makes curl
-record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is to use the \fI-b,
---cookie\fP option.
+This is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS backends.
 
-If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl operation
-won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v will get a warning
-displayed, but that is the only visible feedback you get about this possibly
-lethal situation.
+Added in 7.41.0.
+.IP "--cert-type <type>"
+(TLS) Tells curl what certificate type the provided certificate is in. PEM, DER and
+ENG are recognized types.  If not specified, PEM is assumed.
 
-Since 7.43.0 cookies that were imported in the Set-Cookie format without a
-domain name are not exported by this option.
+If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
 
-If this option is used several times, the last specified file name will be
-used.
-.IP "-C, --continue-at <offset>"
-Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset
-is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped, counting from the beginning
-of the source file before it is transferred to the destination.  If used with
-uploads, the FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.
+See also \fI-E, --cert\fP and \fI--key\fP and \fI--key-type\fP.
+.IP "-E, --cert <certificate[:password]>"
+(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified client certificate file when getting a file
+with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based protocol. The certificate must be in
+PKCS#12 format if using Secure Transport, or PEM format if using any other
+engine.  If the optional password isn't specified, it will be queried for on

+If curl is built against the NSS SSL library then this option can tell
+curl the nickname of the certificate to use within the NSS database defined
+by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the
+NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be
+loaded. If you want to use a file from the current directory, please precede
+it with "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.  If the

+recognized as password delimiter.  If the nickname contains "\\", it needs to
+be escaped as "\\\\" so that it is not recognized as an escape character.
+
+(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then the

+save the uncompressed document.  If this option is used and the server sends
+an unsupported encoding, curl will report an error.
+.IP "-K, --config <file>"
+Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The config file is a
+text file in which command line arguments can be written which then will be
+used as if they were written on the actual command line.
+
+Options and their parameters must be specified on the same config file line,
+separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign. Long option names can
+optionally be given in the config file without the initial double dashes and
+if so, the colon or equals characters can be used as separators. If the option
+is specified with one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals character
+between the option and its parameter.
+
+If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the parameter must be enclosed
+within quotes. Within double quotes, the following escape sequences are
+available: \\\\, \\", \\t, \\n, \\r and \\v. A backslash preceding any other
+letter is ignored. If the first column of a config line is a '#' character,
+the rest of the line will be treated as a comment. Only write one option per
+physical line in the config file.
+
+Specify the filename to \fI-K, --config\fP as '-' to make curl read the file from stdin.
+
+Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify
+it using the \fI--url\fP option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own
+line. So, it could look similar to this:
+
+url = "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/"
+
+When curl is invoked, it always (unless \fI-q, --disable\fP is used) checks for a
+default config file and uses it if found. The default config file is checked
+for in the following places in this order:
+
+1) curl tries to find the "home dir": It first checks for the CURL_HOME and
+then the HOME environment variables. Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on
+Unix-like systems (which returns the home dir given the current user in your
+system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA variable, or as a last
+resort the '%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data'.
+
+2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one
+in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On Unix-like systems, it will
+simply try to load .curlrc from the determined home dir.
+
+.nf
+# --- Example file ---
+# this is a comment
+url = "example.com"
+output = "curlhere.html"
+user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

+This option can be used multiple times to load multiple config files.
 .IP "--connect-timeout <seconds>"
 Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl's connection to take.  This only
 limits the connection phase, so if curl connects within the given period it
 will continue - if not it will exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option
 accepts decimal values.

+For a request to the given HOST:PORT pair, connect to
+CONNECT-TO-HOST:CONNECT-TO-PORT instead.  This option is suitable to direct
+requests at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a cluster of
+servers.  This option is only used to establish the network connection. It
+does NOT affect the hostname/port that is used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI,
+certificate verification) or for the application protocols.  "host" and "port"
+may be the empty string, meaning "any host/port".  "connect-to-host" and
+"connect-to-port" may also be the empty string, meaning "use the request's
+original host/port".
+
+This option can be used many times to add many connect rules.
+
+See also \fI--resolve\fP and \fI-H, --header\fP. Added in 7.49.0.
+.IP "-C, --continue-at <offset>"
+Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset
+is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped, counting from the beginning
+of the source file before it is transferred to the destination.  If used with
+uploads, the FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.
+
+Use "-C -" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the
+transfer. It then uses the given output/input files to figure that out.
+
+If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
+
+See also \fI-r, --range\fP.
+.IP "-c, --cookie-jar <filename>"
+(HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a completed
+operation. Curl writes all cookies from its in-memory cookie storage to the
+given file at the end of operations. If no cookies are known, no data will be
+written. The file will be written using the Netscape cookie file format. If
+you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the cookies will be written to
+stdout.
+
+This command line option will activate the cookie engine that makes curl
+record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is to use the \fI-b, --cookie\fP
+option.
+
+If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl operation
+won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using \fI-v, --verbose\fP will get a warning
+displayed, but that is the only visible feedback you get about this possibly
+lethal situation.
+
+If this option is used several times, the last specified file name will be
+used.
+.IP "-b, --cookie <data>"
+(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It is supposedly
+the data previously received from the server in a "Set-Cookie:" line.  The
+data should be in the format "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".
+
+If no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated as a filename
+to read previously stored cookie from. This option also activates the cookie
+engine which will make curl record incoming cookies, which may be handy if
+you're using this in combination with the \fI-L, --location\fP option or do multiple URL
+transfers on the same invoke.
+
+The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers
+(Set-Cookie style) or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.
+
+The file specified with \fI-b, --cookie\fP is only used as input. No cookies will be
+written to the file. To store cookies, use the \fI-c, --cookie-jar\fP option.
+
+Exercise caution if you are using this option and multiple transfers may
+occur.  If you use the NAME1=VALUE1; format, or in a file use the Set-Cookie
+format and don't specify a domain, then the cookie is sent for any domain
+(even after redirects are followed) and cannot be modified by a server-set
+cookie. If the cookie engine is enabled and a server sets a cookie of the same
+name then both will be sent on a future transfer to that server, likely not
+what you intended.  To address these issues set a domain in Set-Cookie (doing
+that will include sub domains) or use the Netscape format.
 
 If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
+
+Users very often want to both read cookies from a file and write updated
+cookies back to a file, so using both \fI-b, --cookie\fP and \fI-c, --cookie-jar\fP in the same
+command line is common.

-is used to seed the random engine for SSL connections. See also the
-\fI--random-file\fP option.
+Sets a range of environment variables, using the names the \fI-w, --write-out\fP option
+supports, to allow easier extraction of useful information after having run
+curl.
+
+\fI--environment\fP requires that the underlying libcurl was built to support RISC OS.
 .IP "--expect100-timeout <seconds>"
 (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a 100-continue
 response when curl emits an Expects: 100-continue header in its request. By
 default curl will wait one second. This option accepts decimal values! When
 curl stops waiting, it will continue as if the response has been received.
 
-(Added in 7.47.0)
-.IP "--cert-type <type>"
-(SSL) Tells curl what certificate type the provided certificate is in. PEM,
-DER and ENG are recognized types.  If not specified, PEM is assumed.
+See also \fI--connect-timeout\fP. Added in 7.47.0.
+.IP "--fail-early"
+Fail and exit on first detected error.
+
+When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line, it will
+attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By default, it will ignore
+errors if there are more URLs given and the last URL's success will determine
+the error code curl returns. So early failures will be "hidden" by subsequent
+successful transfers.
+
+Using this option, curl will instead return an error on the first transfers
+that fails, independent on the amount of more URLs that are given on the
+command line. This way, no transfer failures go undetected by scripts and
+similar.
 
-If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
-.IP "--cacert <CA certificate>"
-(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The
-file may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM
-format. Normally curl is built to use a default file for this, so this option
-is typically used to alter that default file.
+This option will apply for all given URLs even if you use \fI-:, --next\fP.
 
-curl recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is
-set, and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This option
-overrides that variable.
-
-The windows version of curl will automatically look for a CA certs file named
-\'curl-ca-bundle.crt\', either in the same directory as curl.exe, or in the
-Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your PATH.
-
-If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module
-(libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this option to work properly.
-
-(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then this
-option is supported for backward compatibility with other SSL engines, but it
-should not be set. If the option is not set, then curl will use the
-certificates in the system and user Keychain to verify the peer, which is the
-preferred method of verifying the peer's certificate chain.
-
-If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
-.IP "--capath <CA certificate directory>"
-(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the
-peer. Multiple paths can be provided by separating them with ":" (e.g.
-\&"path1:path2:path3"). The certificates must be in PEM format, and if curl is
-built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been processed using the
-c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using \fI--capath\fP can allow
-OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections much more efficiently than using
-\fI--cacert\fP if the \fI--cacert\fP file contains many CA certificates.
-
-If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored, and if it is
-used several times, the last one will be used.
-.IP "--pinnedpubkey <pinned public key (hashes)>"
-(SSL) Tells curl to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to verify the
-peer. This can be a path to a file which contains a single public key in PEM or
-DER format, or any number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by
-\'sha256//\' and separated by \';\'
-
-When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate
-indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from this certificate and
-if it does not exactly match the public key provided to this option, curl will
-abort the connection before sending or receiving any data.
-

-If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
-.IP "--cert-status"
-(SSL) Tells curl to verify the status of the server certificate by using the
-Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS extension.
-
-If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid (e.g. expired)
-response, if the response suggests that the server certificate has been revoked,
-or no response at all is received, the verification fails.

+.IP "-f, --fail"
+(HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly done to
+better enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases
+when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document
+stating so (which often also describes why and more). This flag will prevent

+.IP "--form-string <name=string>"
+(HTTP) Similar to \fI-F, --form\fP except that the value string for the named parameter is used
+literally. Leading \&'@' and \&'<' characters, and the \&';type=' string in
+the value have no special meaning. Use this in preference to \fI-F, --form\fP if
+there's any possibility that the string value may accidentally trigger the
+\&'@' or \&'<' features of \fI-F, --form\fP.

 .IP "-F, --form <name=content>"
-(HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the
-submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type
+(HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit
+button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type
 multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388. This enables uploading of binary
 files etc. To force the 'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with
 an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
 the symbol <. The difference between @ and < is then that @ makes a file get
 attached in the post as a file upload, while the < makes a text field and just
 get the contents for that text field from a file.
 
 Example: to send an image to a server, where \&'profile' is the name of the
 form-field to which portrait.jpg will be the input:
 
-\fBcurl\fP -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi
+ curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi
 
 To read content from stdin instead of a file, use - as the filename. This goes
 for both @ and < constructs. Unfortunately it does not support reading the
 file from a named pipe or similar, as it needs the full size before the
 transfer starts.
 
 You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using 'type=', in a manner
 similar to:
 
-\fBcurl\fP -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" example.com
+ curl -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" example.com
 
 or
 
-\fBcurl\fP -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" example.com
+ curl -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" example.com
 
 You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload part by setting
 filename=, like this:
 
-\fBcurl\fP -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" example.com
+ curl -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" example.com
 
 If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by double-quotes like:
 
-\fBcurl\fP -F "file=@\\"localfile\\";filename=\\"nameinpost\\"" example.com
+ curl -F "file=@\\"localfile\\";filename=\\"nameinpost\\"" example.com
 
 or
 
-\fBcurl\fP -F 'file=@"localfile";filename="nameinpost"' example.com
+ curl -F 'file=@"localfile";filename="nameinpost"' example.com
 
 Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any double-quote
 or backslash within the filename must be escaped by backslash.
 
 See further examples and details in the MANUAL.
 
 This option can be used multiple times.

+If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
 .IP "-o, --output <file>"
 Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch
 multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number in the <file>
 specifier. That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL
 being fetched. Like in:
 
-  curl http://{one,two}.example.com -o "file_#1.txt"
+ curl http://{one,two}.example.com -o "file_#1.txt"
 
 or use several variables like:
 
-  curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"
+ curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"
 
 You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have. For
 example, if you specify two URLs on the same command line, you can use it like
 this:
 
   curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

 See also the \fI--create-dirs\fP option to create the local directories
 dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash) will force the
 output to be done to stdout.
-.IP "-O, --remote-name"
-Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file
-part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)
 
-The file will be saved in the current working directory. If you want the file
-saved in a different directory, make sure you change the current working
-directory before invoking curl with this option.
-
-The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing
-else, and if it already exists it will be overwritten. If you want the server
-to be able to choose the file name refer to \fI-J, --remote-header-name\fP
-which can be used in addition to this option. If the server chooses a file name
-and that name already exists it will not be overwritten.

-.IP "-p, --proxytunnel"
-When an HTTP proxy is used (\fI-x, --proxy\fP), this option will cause non-HTTP
-protocols to attempt to tunnel through the proxy instead of merely using it to
-do HTTP-like operations. The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy
-CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the

-.IP "-P, --ftp-port <address>"
-(FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when connecting with
-FTP. This switch makes curl use active mode. In practice, curl then tells the
-server to connect back to the client's specified address and port, while
-passive mode asks the server to setup an IP address and port for it to connect
-to. <address> should be one of:
-.RS
-.IP interface

-
-Starting in 7.19.5, you can append \&":[start]-[end]\&" to the right of the
-address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you specify a
-port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as well,

+peer. This can be a path to a file which contains a single public key in PEM
+or DER format, or any number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by
+\'sha256//\' and separated by \';\'
+
+When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate
+indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from this certificate and
+if it does not exactly match the public key provided to this option, curl will
+abort the connection before sending or receiving any data.

+Use the specified proxy before connecting to the ordinary proxy. Hence pre
+proxy. A pre proxy must be a SOCKS speaking proxy.

+The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify
+alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or
+socks5h:// to request the specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol
+specified will make curl default to SOCKS4.
+
+If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed to be
+1080.
+
+User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are URL decoded
+by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters such as @ by using %40
+or pass in a colon with %3a.

+known size, it will instead output one '#' character for every 1024 bytes
+transferred.

 shell-style to embed spaces or special characters.  Following is the list of
 all supported SFTP quote commands:

+(HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also be set
+with the \fI-H, --header\fP flag of course.  When used with \fI-L, --location\fP you can append
+";auto" to the \fI-e, --referer\fP URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL
+when it follows a Location: header. The \&";auto" string can be used alone,

+.IP "-J, --remote-header-name"
+(HTTP) This option tells the \fI-O, --remote-name\fP option to use the server-specified
+Content-Disposition filename instead of extracting a filename from the URL.
+
+If the server specifies a file name and a file with that name already exists
+in the current working directory it will not be overwritten and an error will
+occur. If the server doesn't specify a file name then this option has no
+effect.
+
+There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided file name, so

+
+The file will be saved in the current working directory. If you want the file
+saved in a different directory, make sure you change the current working
+directory before invoking curl with this option.
+
+The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL,
+nothing else, and if it already exists it will be overwritten. If you want the
+server to be able to choose the file name refer to \fI-J, --remote-header-name\fP which
+can be used in addition to this option. If the server chooses a file name and

+.IP "-R, --remote-time"
+When used, this will make curl attempt to figure out the timestamp of the
+remote file, and if that is available make the local file get that same
+timestamp.
+.IP "-X, --request <command>"
+(HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the
+HTTP server.  The specified request method will be used instead of the method
+otherwise used (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for
+details and explanations. Common additional HTTP requests include PUT and
+DELETE, but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and
+more.
+
+Normally you don't need this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD, POST and PUT
+requests are rather invoked by using dedicated command line options.
+
+This option only changes the actual word used in the HTTP request, it does not
+alter the way curl behaves. So for example if you want to make a proper HEAD
+request, using -X HEAD will not suffice. You need to use the \fI-I, --head\fP option.
+
+The method string you set with \fI-X, --request\fP will be used for all requests, which
+if you for example use \fI-L, --location\fP may cause unintended side-effects when curl
+doesn't change request method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and
+similar.

+with FTP.

 .IP "--resolve <host:port:address>"
 Provide a custom address for a specific host and port pair. Using this, you
 can make the curl requests(s) use a specified address and prevent the
 otherwise normally resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of
 /etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The port number should be
 the number used for the specific protocol the host will be used for. It means
 you need several entries if you want to provide address for the same host but
 different ports.

-When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one second and then
-for all forthcoming retries it will double the waiting time until it reaches
-10 minutes which then will be the delay between the rest of the retries.  By

+part in the specified URL, curl will append the local file name. NOTE that you
 must use a trailing / on the last directory to really prove to Curl that there
 is no file name or curl will think that your last directory name is the remote
 file name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to fail. If
 this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will be used.

 Alternately, the file name "." (a single period) may be specified instead
 of "-" to use stdin in non-blocking mode to allow reading server output
 while stdin is being uploaded.

-alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or
-socks5h:// to request the specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol
-specified, http:// and all others will be treated as HTTP proxies. (The
-protocol support was added in curl 7.21.7)
-
-If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed to be

-
-This option overrides existing environment variables that set the proxy to
-use. If there's an environment variable setting a proxy, you can set proxy to
-\&"" to override it.
-
-All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will transparently be
-converted to HTTP. It means that certain protocol specific operations might
-not be available. This is not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as
-one with the \fI-p, --proxytunnel\fP option.
