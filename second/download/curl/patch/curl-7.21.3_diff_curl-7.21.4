+Version 7.21.4 (17 Feb 2011)
+
+Guenter Knauf (17 Feb 2011)
+- Set -fpcc-struct-return only for gcc compiler.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (17 Feb 2011)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: credits since 7.21.3
+  
+  I went through all the names mentioned as authors and in commit messages
+  since 7.21.3, and this list inserted now is sorted on first name.
+
+- nss_load_key: fix unused variable warning
+
+- gmtime: remove define
+  
+  It turns out some systems rely on the gmtime or gmtime_r to be defined
+  already in the system headers and thus my "precaution" redefining of
+  them only caused trouble. They are now removed.
+
+Guenter Knauf (13 Feb 2011)
+- Added -m32 to CFLAGS to compile with x86_64 gcc.
+
+- Updated OpenSSL version, added links to docu.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (10 Feb 2011)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 3bb1291fbd4
+
+- --keepalive-time: warn if not supported properly
+  
+  Since the feature requires support for TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL to
+  function as documented, it now warns if that support is missing when the
+  option is used.
+
+Dan Fandrich (10 Feb 2011)
+- Call ERR_peek_error instead of ERR_peek_last_error
+  
+  The latter isn't available in older OpenSSL versions, and is
+  less useful since it returns the most recent error instead of
+  the first one encountered.
+
+Julien Chaffraix (10 Feb 2011)
+- netrc: Enable setting up the filename in unit tests.
+  
+  Unset the environment variable so that we can specify different
+  filenames in the unit test.
+
+- test1304: Added some unit tests for Curl_parsenetrc.
+  
+  Moved some definitons into the header file so that we can reuse them.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Feb 2011)
+- [Quinn Slack brought this change]
+
+  CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED: removed
+  
+  On second thought, I think CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED should be eliminated. It
+  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
+  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
+  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems
+  appropriate; its error string already includes "passwords" as a possible
+  cause. Having a separate TLS auth error code might also cause people to
+  think that a TLS auth failure means the wrong username or password was
+  entered, when it could also be a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack.
+
+- [Quinn Slack brought this change]
+
+  TLS-SRP: new options documented
+
+- CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION: return proper error code
+  
+  When the callback returns an error, this function must make sure to return
+  CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK properly and not CURLE_OK as before to allow the
+  callback to properly abort the operation.
+
+- curl.1: typo in -v description
+  
+  Reported by: Ian D Allen
+  Bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl/+bug/714895

+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3175422
+
+Julien Chaffraix (7 Feb 2011)
+- netrc: Removed dead code.
+  
+  The main has not been updated from some time and is out of sync with
+  the code. The code is now tested by several test cases so no need for
+  a seperate code path.
+
+- netrc: Tightened up the type checks.
+  
+  The state should not be anonymous so that we can check if the values
+  are fine. Added 2 unreachables states to the switch as a result of this
+  change.
+
+- imap: Fixed typo in a comment.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Feb 2011)
+- Curl_gmtime: avoid future mistakes
+  
+  Document Curl_gmtime() and define away the old functions so that they
+  won't be used internally again by mistake.
+
+- Curl_gmtime: added a portable gmtime
+  
+  Instead of polluting many places with #ifdefs, we create a single place
+  for this function, and also check return code properly so that a NULL
+  pointer returned won't cause problems.
+
+Guenter Knauf (3 Feb 2011)
+- mk-ca-bundle.vbs: use new cacert url
+  
+  The official Mozilla page at http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/
+  points out a new place as the "proper" place to get Mozilla's CA certs from
+  so this script is now updated to use that instead.
+  
+  Reported by: Daniel Mentz
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Feb 2011)
+- mk-ca-bundle.pl: use new cacert url
+  
+  The official Mozilla page at
+  http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/ points out a new place

+- [Bjoern Sikora brought this change]
+
+  ssluse: improved error message on SSL_CTX_new failures
+  
+  "SSL: couldn't create a context" really isn't that helpful, now it'll
+  also extract an explanation from OpenSSL and append to the right.
+
+- [Nicholas Maniscalco brought this change]
+
+  multi: fix CURLM_STATE_TOOFAST for multi_socket
+  
+  The code in the toofast state needs to first recalculate the values
+  before it uses them again since it may have been a while since it last
+  did it when it reaches this point.
+
+- unit1300: code style cleanup
+
+- [Amr Shahin brought this change]
+
+  adding unit tests for Curl_llist_remove
+
+Patrick Monnerat (31 Jan 2011)
+- Include TLSAUTH options in ILE/RPG binding.
+
+Kamil Dudka (31 Jan 2011)
+- [Dave Reisner brought this change]
+
+  file: add support for CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION
+
+- [Dave Reisner brought this change]
+
+  transfer: add Curl_meets_timecondition()
+  
+  This will be used by file_do() and Curl_readwrite() as a unified method
+  of checking to see if a remote document meets the supplied
+  CURLOPT_TIMEVAL and CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION.
+  
+  Signed-off-by: Dave Reisner <d@falconindy.com>
+
+Daniel Stenberg (29 Jan 2011)
+- FAQ: clarified/expanded 6.7 a bit
+  
+  "6.7 What are my obligations when using libcurl in my commercial apps?"
+  got the piece about what exactly "in all copies" mean to a user of the
+  code.
+  
+  This interpretation is based on what other MIT-like licenses have made
+  more explicit.
+
+- COPYING: update the year to 2011
+  
+  The generic copyright year range now includes 2011
+
+- [Pierre Joye brought this change]
+
+  Windows build: alternative makefile
+  
+  This is a separate makefile for MSVC builds. It is deliberately put in
+  another dir than src/ and lib/ to allow a different build experience
+  than the previous - at least during a period. Eventually we should
+  unify.
+
+- test: add test 580 to the dist
+
+Dan Fandrich (27 Jan 2011)
+- Some minor edits including updates to function names
+
+Daniel Stenberg (27 Jan 2011)
+- ares: memory leak fix
+  
+  The double name resolve trick used with c-ares could leave allocated
+  memory in 'temp_ai' if the operation was aborted in the middle.
+
+- ares_query_completed_cb: don't touch invalid data
+  
+  When this callback is called due to the destruction of the ares handle,
+  the connection pointer passed in as an argument may no longer pointing
+  to valid data and this function doesn't need to do anything with it
+  anyway so we make sure it doesn't.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-01/0333.html
+  Reported by: Vsevolod Novikov
+
+Kamil Dudka (27 Jan 2011)
+- nss: avoid memory leaks and failure of NSS shutdown
+  
+  ... in case more than one CA is loaded.
+  
+  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/670802
+
+Dan Fandrich (26 Jan 2011)
+- Mention that sftp quote commands can be quoted
+
+Daniel Stenberg (25 Jan 2011)
+- tests: more multiple headers checks
+
+- HTTP: memory leak on multiple Location:
+  
+  The HTTP parser allocated memory on each received Location: header
+  without properly freeing old data. Starting now, the code only considers
+  the first Location: header and will blissfully ignore subsequent ones.
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3165129
+  Reported by: Martin Lemke
+
+- FAQ: clarify 5.13 how to stop a transfer
+
+Guenter Knauf (22 Jan 2011)
+- Fixed C++ style comment not allowed in ISO C90.
+
+Dan Fandrich (21 Jan 2011)

+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Jan 2011)
+- runtests.pl: make -s not show skipped tests

+- [Darshan Mody brought this change]
+
+  Fixed compile using OpenSSL versions < 0.9.4a
+
+Daniel Stenberg (19 Jan 2011)
+- main: make the tlsauth options always present
+  
+  ... to not make the connection between the tool and the libcurl used
+  tighter than necessary, the tlsauth options are now always present but
+  if the used libcurl doesn't have TLSAUTH support it will return failure.
+  
+  Also, replaced strncmp() with strequal to get case insensitive matching.
+
+- symbols-in-versions: add the new TLSAUTH-SRP symbols
+
+- configure: TLS-SRP wasn't added as a feature
+  
+  Test case 1014 failed since TLS-SRP was correctly set to the features
+  variable so curl-config --features didn't output it.
+
+- dist: add new certs to tarball
+
+- [Quinn Slack brought this change]
+
+  TLS-SRP: support added when using GnuTLS
+
+- CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER: more clarifications
+  
+  The default value is 1.
+  
+  curl _uses_ a default CA bundle, it doesn't install one.
+  
+  Drop the references to 7.10 as that is now >8 years old!
+
+- TheArtOfHttpScripting: extended

+
+- Some Borland C++ makefile tweaks.
+
+- Borland C++ doesnt have struct sockaddr_storage.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Jan 2011)
+- connect: use UDP correctly
+  
+  The idea that the protocol and socktype is part of name resolving in the
+  libc functions is nuts. We keep the name resolver functions assume
+  TCP/STREAM and we make sure that when we want to connect to a UDP
+  service we use the correct UDP/DGRAM set instead. This bug was because
+  the ->protocol field was not always set correctly.
+  
+  This bug was only affecting ipv6-disabled non-cares non-threaded builds.

+  the previous cmake commit
+
+Dan Fandrich (5 Jan 2011)
+- Made unit_setup() return an error code to abort the test early
+  
+  This makes it possible to skip the call to unit_stop() in such
+  cases.  Also use Curl_safefree() in unit test 1302 so it will
+  pass the memory torture test.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (6 Jan 2011)
+- SSH: speedcheck clobbered existing error
+  
+  The just added speedcheck must not ruin the error code if already set
+  due to a problem.
+
+- [Brad King brought this change]
+
+  CMake: Use upstream CheckTypeSize module
+  
+  The CheckTypeSize module that comes with CMake 2.6.2 and above does
+  everything we need and also supports cross-compiling.  Avoid duplicating
+  an older version of it here.  This also fixes a cross-compiling error
+  because the old line
+  
+    include ("${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}/CheckTypeSize.cmake")
+  
+  failed because CMAKE_MODULE_PATH is a search path and not a directory.
+  
+  Signed-off-by: Brad King <brad.king@kitware.com>
+
+- SSH: acknowledge speedcheck
+  
+  Check for speedcheck limits during the state machine traversals
+
+- tests: <info> tag corrections
+
+- unittest: 1303 tests Curl_timeleft
+  
+  I came up with 33 different ways to call it and verify that it returns the
+  correct return code.
+
+- curlcheck.h: add fail()
+  
+  fail is a new function/macro that a test case can use to indicate a test
+  failure for cases when the standard macros are not sufficient.
+
+- Curl_timeleft: s/conn/data in first argument
+  
+  As the function doesn't really use the connectdata struct but only the
+  SessionHanadle struct I modified what argument it wants.
+
+Dan Fandrich (4 Jan 2011)
+- Fixed path to allow out-of-tree builds
+
+Kamil Dudka (4 Jan 2011)
+- nss: avoid CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY given a file name without any slash

+- ignore: all executable unit test cases

+
+- unittest: test base64 encode/decode

+- curlcheck.h: avoid using NULL pointers
+
+- curlcheck.h: add verify_memory
+  
+  This check verifies that a pointer contains the correct data.
+
+- curlcheck.h: add newlines in error messages
+
+- unittest: verify curl_strequal
+
+- get_cert_chain: support larger data sets
+  
+  512 bytes turned out too short for some data, so now we allocate a
+  larger buffer instead
+  
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2011-01/0002.html
+
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 83e9fb21aabbec2
+
+- curlcheck.h: add fail_if() fix code
+  
+  The UNITTEST_START and UNITTEST_STOP defines needed to do a new brace
+  level so that test cases can declare variables fine and still remain
+  fine C89 code.
+
+- unittests: basic docs
+
+- ignore: unit test files
+
+- unittests: a dedicated feature in tests
+  
+  The test runner script now knows if unittests can run and the unit test
+  setup file says it is one. I also made runtests.pl deal with no
+  <command> tag set, so that the description file can get even simpler.
+
+- unittesting: build a separate static lib
+  
+  When configure --enable-debug has been used, all files in lib/ are now
+  built twice and a separate static library crafted for unit-testing will
+  be linked. The unit tests in the tests/unit subdir will use that
+  library.
+
+- unittest: framework for unit-testing
+  
+  This is the first approach at doing fairly clean and easy to write and
+  debug unit tests.
+
+- SSH: avoid PATH_MAX with alloc
+  
+  We cannot assume that PATH_MAX will be enough for the remote path name
+  so allocating room for it is the only sensible approach.
+
+- TODO: get rid of PATH_MAX
+
+- Curl_nss_connect: avoid PATH_MAX
+  
+  Since some systems don't have PATH_MAX and it isn't that clever to
+  assume a fixed maximum path length, the code now allocates buffer space
+  instead of using stack.
+  
+  Reported by: Samuel Thibault
+  Bug: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=608521
+
+- SFTP: make pwd output result to header callback
+  
+  Sending "pwd" as a QUOTE command only sent the reply to the
+  DEBUGFUNCTION. Now it also sends an FTP-like header to the header
+  callback to allow similar operations as with FTP, and apps can re-use
+  the same parser.
+
+- pubkey_show: allocate buffer to fit any-size result
+  
+  The loop condition was wrong so keys larger than 340 bits would overflow
+  the local stack-based buffer.
+
+- CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH: sftp support
+
+- [Luke Amery brought this change]
+
+  ssh: honour the CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH curl_getinfo option

+Daniel Stenberg (27 Dec 2010)
+- c-ares: fix cancelled resolves
+  
+  When built IPv6-enabled, we could do Curl_done() with one of the two
+  resolves having returned already, so when ares_cancel() is called the
+  resolve callback ends up doing funny things (sometimes resulting in a
+  segfault) since it would try to actually store the previous resolve even
+  though we're shutting down the resolve.
+  
+  This bug was introduced in commit 8ab137b2bc9630ce so it hasn't been
+  included in any public release.

+
+  Typo / spelling fixes.
+
+- [Brad Hards brought this change]
+
+  Use angle address, as for the rest of the example.
+  
+  Also spelling fix for RECIPIENT #define.
+
+- [Brad Hards brought this change]
+
+  Add angle brackets to addresses in easy SMTP examples, as for smtp-multi example.
+
+- cookies: tricked dotcounter fixed
+  
+  Providing multiple dots in a series in the domain field (domain=..com) could
+  trick the cookie engine to wrongly accept the cookie believing it to be
+  fine. Since the tailmatching would then match all .com sites, the cookie would
+  then be sent to all of them.
+  
+  The code now requires at least one letter between each dot for them to be
+  counted. Edited test case 61 to verify this.
+
+- multi: connect fail => use next IP address
+  
+  When using the multi interface and connecting to a host name that
+  resolves to multiple IP addresses, there was no logic that made it
+  continue to the next IP if connecting to the first address times
+  out. This is now corrected.
+
+- smtp-multi: put recipient within <brackets>
+  
+  Even if libcurl might to do it for us, it is more correct.
+
+- ossl_seed: no more RAND_screen
+  
+  RAND_screen() is slow, not thread-safe and not needed anymore since OpenSSL
+  uses the thread-safe win32 CryptoAPI nowadays.
+
+- multi: inhibit some verbose outputs
+  
+  The info about pipe status and expire cleared are clearly debug-related
+  and not anything mere mortals will or should care about so they are now
+  ifdef'ed DEBUGBUILD
+
+- SMTP tests: updated MAIL FROM use
+  
+  They were all wrong previously since none used the <brackets> they
+  should for MAIL FROM. Now libcurl adds them itself if the app doesn't so
+  they end up wrong less easy.
+
+- CURLOPT_MAIL_FROM: document the bracket situation
+
+- [Brad Hards brought this change]
+
+  SMTP: add brackets for MAIL FROM
+  
+  Similar to what is done already for RCPT TO, the code now checks for and
+  adds angle brackets (<>) around the email address that is provided for
+  CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT unless the app has done so itself.

-
-- - When downloading compressed content over HTTP and the app as asked libcurl
-    to automatically uncompress it with the CURLOPT_ENCODING option, libcurl
-    could wrongly provide the callback with more data than what the maximum
-    documented amount. An application could thus get tricked into badness if the

-- SIGTERM is the signal to trap here, SIGKILL can't be caught.

-
-- Allow killsockfilters() to take a 5th optional parameter that when provided
-  indicates that only one of the two possible sockfilter processes should be
-  killed.  Valid values for this parameter are 'main' and 'data'.

-
-Daniel Stenberg (20 Jan 2010)
-- modified test case 8 to also make sure that we deal with cookies using
-  identical names but different paths properly
-
-- - As was pointed out on the http-state mailing list, the order of cookies in a
-    HTTP Cookie: header _needs_ to be sorted on the path length in the cases
-    where two cookies using the same name are set more than once using
-    (overlapping) paths. Realizing this, identically named cookies must be
-    sorted correctly. But detecting only identically named cookies and take care
-    of them individually is harder than just to blindly and unconditionally sort
-    all cookies based on their path lengths. All major browsers also already do
-    this, so this makes our behavior one step closer to them in the cookie area.
-  
-    Test case 8 was the only one that broke due to this change and I updated it
-    accordingly.
-
-- oops, I forgot to cvs add this before my previous commit (Dan Fandrich
-  pointed it out to me)
-
-- - David McCreedy brought a fix and a new test case (129) to make libcurl work
-    again when downloading files over FTP using ASCII and it turns out that the
-    final size of the file is not the same as the initial size the server
-    reported. This is very common since servers don't take the newline
-    conversions into account.

-- "260 - IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support" done!
-
-- avoid "Use of uninitialized value $l in concatenation"
-
-Yang Tse (19 Jan 2010)
-- Fail harder when curl coredumps trying to verify http and ftp servers.

-  Add some debug messages to see what's going on with valgrind logs.
-
-- prevent %runcert hash growth when clearing items

-- Constantine Sapuntzakis enhancements to make memory tracking log file writing
-  of messages atomic, on systems where an fwrite of a memory buffer is atomic.

-- - Suppressed side effect of OpenSSL configure checks, which prevented NSS from
-    being properly detected under certain circumstances. It had been caused by
-    strange behavior of pkg-config when handling PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR. pkg-config

+   and associated tools. PATH environment variable must include the path to
+   bin subdirectory of your compiler installation, eg: c:\Borland\BCC55\bin
+
+   It is advisable to set environment variable BCCDIR to the base path of
+   the compiler installation.
+
+     set BCCDIR=c:\Borland\BCC55
+
+   In order to build a plain vanilla version of curl and libcurl run the

+
+   To build curl and libcurl with zlib and OpenSSL support set environment

+   run command:
+
+     make borland-ssl-zlib
+
+   libcurl library will be built in 'lib' subdirectory while curl tool
+   is built in 'src' subdirectory. In order to use libcurl library it is
+   advisable to modify compiler's configuration file bcc32.cfg located
+   in c:\Borland\BCC55\bin to reflect the location of libraries include
+   paths for example the '-I' line could result in something like:

+   bcc3.cfg '-L' line could also be modified to reflect the location of
+   of libcurl library resulting for example:

-   are present in the /path_to_curl/lib directory. (Check the src

+   subdirectory run following command from mentioned subdirectory:
 
-   command line:
-   make -f /path_to_curl/lib/Makefile-ssl.b32

This option is OpenSSL-specific and does nothing if libcurl is built to use GnuTLS. NSS-powered libcurl provides the option only for backward compatibility. 
 <p class="level0"><a name="CURLOPTCRLFILE"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLOPT_CRLFILE</span> 
 <p class="level1">Pass a char * to a zero terminated string naming a file with the concatenation of CRL (in PEM format) to use in the certificate validation that occurs during the SSL exchange. 
 <p class="level1">When curl is built to use NSS or GnuTLS, there is no way to influence the use of CRL passed to help in the verification process. When libcurl is built with OpenSSL support, X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK and X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL are both set, requiring CRL check against all the elements of the certificate chain if a CRL file is passed. 
 <p class="level1">This option makes sense only when used in combination with the <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</a> option. 
 <p class="level1">A specific error code (CURLE_SSL_CRL_BADFILE) is defined with the option. It is returned when the SSL exchange fails because the CRL file cannot be loaded. A failure in certificate verification due to a revocation information found in the CRL does not trigger this specific error. (Added in 7.19.0) 
-<p class="level0"><a name="CURLOPTCERTINFO"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLOPT_CERTINFO</span> 
-<p class="level1">Pass a long set to 1 to enable libcurl's certificate chain info gatherer. With this enabled, libcurl (if built with OpenSSL) will extract lots of information and data about the certificates in the certificate chain used in the SSL connection. This data is then possible to extract after a transfer using <a class="emphasis" href="./curl_easy_getinfo.html">curl_easy_getinfo(3)</a> and its option <span Class="emphasis">CURLINFO_CERTINFO</span>. (Added in 7.19.1) 
-<p class="level0"><a name="CURLOPTRANDOMFILE"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE</span> 
-<p class="level1">Pass a char * to a zero terminated file name. The file will be used to read from to seed the random engine for SSL. The more random the specified file is, the more secure the SSL connection will become. 
-<p class="level0"><a name="CURLOPTEGDSOCKET"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET</span> 
-<p class="level1">Pass a char * to the zero terminated path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. It will be used to seed the random engine for SSL. 
 <p class="level0"><a name="CURLOPTSSLVERIFYHOST"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</span> 
 <p class="level1">Pass a long as parameter. 
 <p class="level1">This option determines whether libcurl verifies that the server cert is for the server it is known as. 
 <p class="level1">When negotiating a SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity. 
 <p class="level1">When <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTSSLVERIFYHOST">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</a> is 2, that certificate must indicate that the server is the server to which you meant to connect, or the connection fails. 
 <p class="level1">Curl considers the server the intended one when the Common Name field or a Subject Alternate Name field in the certificate matches the host name in the URL to which you told Curl to connect. 
 <p class="level1">When the value is 1, the certificate must contain a Common Name field, but it doesn't matter what name it says.  (This is not ordinarily a useful setting). 
 <p class="level1">When the value is 0, the connection succeeds regardless of the names in the certificate. 
-<p class="level1">The default, since 7.10, is 2. 
-<p class="level1">This option controls checking the server's claimed identity.  The server could be lying.  To control lying, see <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</a>. 
+<p class="level1">The default value for this option is 2.

 <p class="level0"><a name="CURLOPTSSLCIPHERLIST"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</span> 
 <p class="level1">Pass a char *, pointing to a zero terminated string holding the list of ciphers to use for the SSL connection. The list must be syntactically correct, it consists of one or more cipher strings separated by colons. Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators but colons are normally used, !, - and + can be used as operators. 
 <p class="level1">For OpenSSL and GnuTLS valid examples of cipher lists include 'RC4-SHA', &acute;SHA1+DES&acute;, 'TLSv1' and 'DEFAULT'. The default list is normally set when you compile OpenSSL. 
 <p class="level1">You'll find more details about cipher lists on this URL: <span Class="emphasis"><a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html">http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</a></span> 
 <p class="level1">For NSS, valid examples of cipher lists include 'rsa_rc4_128_md5', &acute;rsa_aes_128_sha&acute;, etc. With NSS you don't add/remove ciphers. If one uses this option then all known ciphers are disabled and only those passed in are enabled.

 When using multiple threads you should set the CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL option to 1
 for all handles. Everything will or might work fine except that timeouts are
 not honored during the DNS lookup - which you can work around by building
 libcurl with c-ares support. c-ares is a library that provides asynchronous
 name resolves. On some platforms, libcurl simply will not function properly
 multi-threaded unless this option is set.

 <p class="level0">There will always be times when the transfer fails for some reason. You might have set the wrong libcurl option or misunderstood what the libcurl option actually does, or the remote server might return non-standard replies that confuse the library which then confuses your program. 
 <p class="level0">There's one golden rule when these things occur: set the CURLOPT_VERBOSE option to 1. It'll cause the library to spew out the entire protocol details it sends, some internal info and some received protocol data as well (especially when using FTP). If you're using HTTP, adding the headers in the received output to study is also a clever way to get a better understanding why the server behaves the way it does. Include headers in the normal body output with CURLOPT_HEADER set 1. 
 <p class="level0">Of course, there are bugs left. We need to know about them to be able to fix them, so we're quite dependent on your bug reports! When you do report suspected bugs in libcurl, please include as many details as you possibly can: a protocol dump that CURLOPT_VERBOSE produces, library version, as much as possible of your code that uses libcurl, operating system name and version, compiler name and version etc.

  HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and
  password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're
  doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by
  default) is *plain* *text* based, which means it sends username and password
  only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on
  the network between you and the remote server.
 
  To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication:
 
-        curl --user name:password http://www.secrets.com
+        curl --user name:password http://www.example.com
 
  The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers
  returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even

  must be able to record and send back cookies the way the web application
  expects them. The same way browsers deal with them.
 
  The simplest way to send a few cookies to the server when getting a page with
  curl is to add them on the command line like:
 
-        curl --cookie "name=Daniel" http://www.cookiesite.com
+        curl --cookie "name=Daniel" http://www.example.com
 
  Cookies are sent as common HTTP headers. This is practical as it allows curl
  to record cookies simply by recording headers. Record cookies with curl by
  using the --dump-header (-D) option like:
 
-        curl --dump-header headers_and_cookies http://www.cookiesite.com
+        curl --dump-header headers_and_cookies http://www.example.com
 
  (Take note that the --cookie-jar option described below is a better way to
  store cookies.)
 
  Curl has a full blown cookie parsing engine built-in that comes to use if you
  want to reconnect to a server and use cookies that were stored from a
  previous connection (or handicrafted manually to fool the server into
  believing you had a previous connection). To use previously stored cookies,
  you run curl like:
 
-        curl --cookie stored_cookies_in_file http://www.cookiesite.com
+        curl --cookie stored_cookies_in_file http://www.example.com
 
  Curl's "cookie engine" gets enabled when you use the --cookie option. If you
  only want curl to understand received cookies, use --cookie with a file that
- doesn't exist. Example, if you want to let curl understand cookies from a page 
- and follow a location (and thus possibly send back cookies it received), you
- can invoke it like:
+ doesn't exist. Example, if you want to let curl understand cookies from a

-        curl --cookie nada --location http://www.cookiesite.com
+        curl --cookie nada --location http://www.example.com
 
  Curl has the ability to read and write cookie files that use the same file
  format that Netscape and Mozilla do. It is a convenient way to share cookies
- between browsers and automatic scripts. The --cookie (-b) switch automatically
- detects if a given file is such a cookie file and parses it, and by using the
- --cookie-jar (-c) option you'll make curl write a new cookie file at the end of

  11.1 Certificates
 
   In the HTTPS world, you use certificates to validate that you are the one
   you claim to be, as an addition to normal passwords. Curl supports client-
   side certificates. All certificates are locked with a pass phrase, which you
   need to enter before the certificate can be used by curl. The pass phrase
   can be specified on the command line or if not, entered interactively when
   curl queries for it. Use a certificate with curl on a HTTPS server like:
 
-        curl --cert mycert.pem https://that.secure.server.com
+        curl --cert mycert.pem https://secure.example.com
 
   curl also tries to verify that the server is who it claims to be, by
   verifying the server's certificate against a locally stored CA cert
   bundle. Failing the verification will cause curl to deny the connection. You
   must then use --insecure (-k) in case you want to tell curl to ignore that
   the server can't be verified.

  Doing fancy stuff, you may need to add or change elements of a single curl
  request.
 
  For example, you can change the POST request to a PROPFIND and send the data
  as "Content-Type: text/xml" (instead of the default Content-Type) like this:
 
-        curl --data "<xml>" --header "Content-Type: text/xml" --request PROPFIND url.com
+         curl --data "<xml>" --header "Content-Type: text/xml" \
+              --request PROPFIND url.com
 
  You can delete a default header by providing one without content. Like you
  can ruin the request by chopping off the Host: header:
 
-        curl --header "Host:" http://mysite.com
+        curl --header "Host:" http://www.example.com
 
  You can add headers the same way. Your server may want a "Destination:"
  header, and you can add it:
 
-        curl --header "Destination: http://moo.com/nowhere" http://url.com
