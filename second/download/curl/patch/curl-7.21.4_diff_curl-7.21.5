+# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
+#
+# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
+# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
+# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
+#
+# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
+# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
+#
+# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
+#
+# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
+# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
+# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
+# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.
+
+# This is to help aclocal find these macros, as it can't see m4_define.

-Version 7.21.4 (17 Feb 2011)
+Version 7.21.5 (17 Apr 2011)
 
-Guenter Knauf (17 Feb 2011)
-- Set -fpcc-struct-return only for gcc compiler.
+Daniel Stenberg (17 Apr 2011)
+- base64.c: removed wrong comment
 
-Daniel Stenberg (17 Feb 2011)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: credits since 7.21.3
+- INTERNALS: clean up
   
-  I went through all the names mentioned as authors and in commit messages
-  since 7.21.3, and this list inserted now is sorted on first name.
-
-- nss_load_key: fix unused variable warning
+  Clarified the release procedure
 
-- gmtime: remove define
+- TODO-RELEASE: push the remaining ones to next release
   
-  It turns out some systems rely on the gmtime or gmtime_r to be defined
-  already in the system headers and thus my "precaution" redefining of
-  them only caused trouble. They are now removed.
-
-Guenter Knauf (13 Feb 2011)
-- Added -m32 to CFLAGS to compile with x86_64 gcc.
-
-- Updated OpenSSL version, added links to docu.
+  As we're closing in on the release, I give up on the remaining ones but
+  I leave them in here for now to try to fix for next release.
+  
+  I removed the 281 issue about warnings from the statical analyzer scans,
+  as they seem to be mostly false positives at this point.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (10 Feb 2011)
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 3bb1291fbd4
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with c246f63a71
 
-- --keepalive-time: warn if not supported properly
+- Curl_ssl_shutdown: restore send/recv pointers
   
-  Since the feature requires support for TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL to
-  function as documented, it now warns if that support is missing when the
-  option is used.
-
-Dan Fandrich (10 Feb 2011)
-- Call ERR_peek_error instead of ERR_peek_last_error
+  When going back from SSL, put the send/recv function pointers back to
+  the plain versions.
   
-  The latter isn't available in older OpenSSL versions, and is
-  less useful since it returns the most recent error instead of
-  the first one encountered.
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-04/0070.html
+  Reported by: Mehmet Bozkurt
 
-Julien Chaffraix (10 Feb 2011)
-- netrc: Enable setting up the filename in unit tests.
-  
-  Unset the environment variable so that we can specify different
-  filenames in the unit test.
+Guenter Knauf (16 Apr 2011)
+- Changed email per Gisle's request.
 
-- test1304: Added some unit tests for Curl_parsenetrc.
+Daniel Stenberg (14 Apr 2011)
+- curl.1: error code update
   
-  Moved some definitons into the header file so that we can reuse them.
+  Error 4 has got a meaning
+  
+  Error 48 has got a slightly different meaning now
 
-Daniel Stenberg (9 Feb 2011)
-- [Quinn Slack brought this change]
+- FAQ: c-ares does ipv6 pretty well now
 
-  CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED: removed
-  
-  On second thought, I think CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED should be eliminated. It
-  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
-  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
-  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems
-  appropriate; its error string already includes "passwords" as a possible
-  cause. Having a separate TLS auth error code might also cause people to
-  think that a TLS auth failure means the wrong username or password was
-  entered, when it could also be a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack.
+- [Andrei Benea brought this change]
 
-- [Quinn Slack brought this change]
+  Fix a buffer overflow in pubkey_show().
 
-  TLS-SRP: new options documented
+Guenter Knauf (14 Apr 2011)
+- Replaced var manipulations with perlish hacks.
 
-- CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION: return proper error code
+Dan Fandrich (12 Apr 2011)
+- Updated minimum binary sizes
+
+Daniel Stenberg (12 Apr 2011)
+- configure: libssh2 link fix without pkg-config
   
-  When the callback returns an error, this function must make sure to return
-  CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK properly and not CURLE_OK as before to allow the
-  callback to properly abort the operation.
+  The script didn't properly add the -lssh2 link option when it enabled
+  libssh2 linking where pkg-config isn't found.
+  
+  Reported by: Saqib Ali
+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-04/0054.html
 
-- curl.1: typo in -v description
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with f01df197981
+
+- checkconnection: don't call with NULL pointer
   
-  Reported by: Ian D Allen
-  Bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl/+bug/714895
+  When checking if an existing RTSP connection is alive or not, the
+  checkconnection function might be called with a SessionHandle pointer
+  being NULL and then referenced causing a crash. This happened only using
+  the multi interface.

+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3280739
 
-Julien Chaffraix (7 Feb 2011)
-- netrc: Removed dead code.
+- curl.1: spell out the -O target directory
   
-  The main has not been updated from some time and is out of sync with
-  the code. The code is now tested by several test cases so no need for
-  a seperate code path.
+  When using -O the file will be saved in the current directory, and this
+  is now spelled out clearly.
 
-- netrc: Tightened up the type checks.
+- OpenSSL: no-sslv2 aware
   
-  The state should not be anonymous so that we can check if the values
-  are fine. Added 2 unreachables states to the switch as a result of this
-  change.
+  Allow openSSL without SSL2 to be used. This fix is inspired by the fix
+  provided by Cristian RodrÌguez.
+  
+  Reported by: Cristian RodrÌguez
 
-- imap: Fixed typo in a comment.
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_RESOLVE typo version
+  
+  Reported by: Hongli Lai
 
-Daniel Stenberg (7 Feb 2011)
-- Curl_gmtime: avoid future mistakes
+Kamil Dudka (8 Apr 2011)
+- nss: allow to use multiple client certificates for a single host
   
-  Document Curl_gmtime() and define away the old functions so that they
-  won't be used internally again by mistake.
+  In case a client certificate is used, invalidate SSL session cache
+  at the end of a session.  This forces NSS to ask for a new client
+  certificate when connecting second time to the same host.
+  
+  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/689031
 
-- Curl_gmtime: added a portable gmtime
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Apr 2011)
+- mk-ca-bundle.pl: show full URL in output
   
-  Instead of polluting many places with #ifdefs, we create a single place
-  for this function, and also check return code properly so that a NULL
-  pointer returned won't cause problems.
+  When I decided to search for a potential error with the cacert bundle it
+  struck me I wanted to see the full source URL in the output...
 
-Guenter Knauf (3 Feb 2011)
-- mk-ca-bundle.vbs: use new cacert url
+Dan Fandrich (7 Apr 2011)
+- Added mention of FTP proxies
+
+Daniel Stenberg (7 Apr 2011)
+- [Gisle Vanem brought this change]

+  src/Makefile.b32: updates
   
-  The official Mozilla page at http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/
-  points out a new place as the "proper" place to get Mozilla's CA certs from
-  so this script is now updated to use that instead.
+  * Rename the object object directory from 'objs' to 'BCC_obj' to be in
+   sync with my previous patch for lib/Makefile.b32.

+    -w-pia   8060 Possibly incorrect assignment
+    -w-pin  8061 Initialization is only partially bracketed

-  http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/ points out a new place

+   and 'rd'. When having MingW/Msys programs 'mkdir.exe' and 'rmdir.exe' in
+  $PATH, this confuses Borland's make and the result (the cleaning etc.) would
+   not be as expected.
   
-  Reported by: Daniel Mentz
+  * Removed the preprocessing step; no need for PP_CMD and the .int files.
+   curl.exe builds fine w/o and the makefile gets simpler.
+  
+  * Added a target for creating a compressed hugehelp.c if WITH_ZLIB is  defined.
+  It assumes groff, gzip and perl is available if such an "advanced"  users
+  requests it. Okay? BTW. My groff and Perl needs unix-slashes ('/').
+   Other perls should handle both forms ('/' and '\').

-  ssluse: improved error message on SSL_CTX_new failures
+  lib/Makefile.b32: updates
   
-  "SSL: couldn't create a context" really isn't that helpful, now it'll
-  also extract an explanation from OpenSSL and append to the right.
+  * Rename the object object directory from 'objs' to 'BCC_obj'. I feel
+   it should be named properly. Ref. Makefile.Watcom where it's called
+   'WC_Win32.obj'.
+  
+  * Turn off these warnings to keep the build totally silent (with CBuilder-6

+    -w-pia   8060 Possibly incorrect assignment
+    -w-pin  8061 Initialization is only partially bracketed

+  I'm sure the warnings could be fixed the "proper" way or with some added

-  "6.7 What are my obligations when using libcurl in my commercial apps?"
-  got the piece about what exactly "in all copies" mean to a user of the
-  code.
+  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN replaces return code 4 that has been obsoleted for
+  several years. It is used for returning error when something is
+  attempted to be used but the feature/option was not enabled or
+  explictitly disabled at build-time. Getting this error mostly means that
+  libcurl needs to be rebuilt.
   
-  This interpretation is based on what other MIT-like licenses have made
-  more explicit.
+  CURLE_FAILED_INIT is now saved and used strictly for init
+  failures. Getting this problem means something went seriously wrong,
+  like a resource shortage or similar.
+  
+  CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION is the option formerly known as
+  CURLE_UNKNOWN_TELNET_OPTION (and the old name is still present,
+  separately defined to be removed in a very distant future). This error
+  code is meant to be used to return when an option is given to libcurl
+  that isn't known. This problem would mostly indicate a problem in the
+  program that uses libcurl.

-- Made unit_setup() return an error code to abort the test early

-  This makes it possible to skip the call to unit_stop() in such
-  cases.  Also use Curl_safefree() in unit test 1302 so it will
-  pass the memory torture test.
+  The protocol handler struct got a 'flags' field for special information
+  and characteristics of the given protocol.
+  
+  This now enables us to move away central protocol information such as
+  CLOSEACTION and DUALCHANNEL from single defines in a central place, out
+  to each protocol's definition. It also made us stop abusing the protocol
+  field for other info than the protocol, and we could start cleaning up
+  other protocol-specific things by adding flags bits to set in the
+  handler struct.
+  
+  The "protocol" field connectdata struct was removed as well and the code
+  now refers directly to the conn->handler->protocol field instead. To
+  make things work properly, the code now always store a conn->given
+  pointer that points out the original handler struct so that the code can
+  learn details from the original protocol even if conn->handler is
+  modified along the way - for example when switching to go over a HTTP
+  proxy.

+- ssh_statemach_act: set cselect for sftp upload
   
-  fail is a new function/macro that a test case can use to indicate a test
-  failure for cases when the standard macros are not sufficient.
+  For uploads we want to use the _sending_ function even when the socket
+  turns out readable as the underlying libssh2 sftp send function will
+  deal with both accordingly. This is what the cselect_bits magic is for.
+  
+  Fixes test 582.

-  number of alive handles again and thus it could go negative.
+  "6.7 What are my obligations when using libcurl in my commercial apps?"

-- Curl_wait_for_resolv: correct timeout
-

-- CURLOPT_RESOLVE: added
+Yang Tse (28 Dec 2010)
+- test harness: take in account that Windows does not support LD_PRELOAD
   
-  CURLOPT_RESOLVE is a new option that sends along a curl_slist with
-  name:port:address sets that will populate the DNS cache with entries so
-  that request can be "fooled" to use another host than what otherwise
-  would've been used. Previously we've encouraged the use of Host: for
-  that when dealing with HTTP, but this new feature has the added bonus
-  that it allows the name from the URL to be used for TLS SNI and server
-  certificate name checks as well.
+  configure.ac: Test harness libhostname library will not be built for Windows.
   
-  This is a first change. Surely more will follow to make it decent.
+  runtests.pl: LD_PRELOAD mechanism will not be used to load libhostname
+  library on operating systems which lack LD_PRELOAD support.

-  LDAP: detect non-binary attributes properly

-  If the query result has a binary attribute, the binary attribute is
-  base64 encoded. But all following non binary attributes are also base64
-  encoded which is wrong.
+  Add angle brackets to addresses in easy SMTP examples, as for smtp-multi example.
+
+- cookies: tricked dotcounter fixed
   
-  This is a test (LDAP server is public).
+  Providing multiple dots in a series in the domain field (domain=..com) could
+  trick the cookie engine to wrongly accept the cookie believing it to be
+  fine. Since the tailmatching would then match all .com sites, the cookie would
+  then be sent to all of them.
   
-  curl
-  ldap://x500.bund.de:389/o=Bund,c=DE?userCertificate,certificateSerialNumber?sub
-  ?cn=*Woehleke*
+  The code now requires at least one letter between each dot for them to be
+  counted. Edited test case 61 to verify this.
 
-- xattr: add configure check and #ifdefs
+- multi: connect fail => use next IP address
   
-  setxattr is a glibc call to set extended attributes, so configure now
-  checks for it and the code is adapted to only build when the
-  functionality is present.
-
-- [Stefan Tomanek brought this change]
+  When using the multi interface and connecting to a host name that
+  resolves to multiple IP addresses, there was no logic that made it
+  continue to the next IP if connecting to the first address times
+  out. This is now corrected.
 
-  save metadata to extended file attributes
+- smtp-multi: put recipient within <brackets>
   
-  It is often convinient to track back the source of a once downloaded
-  file; this patch makes curl store the source URL and other metadata
-  alongside the retrieved file by using the extended attributes (if
-  supported by the file system and enabled by --xattr).
+  Even if libcurl might to do it for us, it is more correct.
 
-- test: remove test 580
-  
-  Test 580 is removed again for two reasons:
-  
-  1) Some compilers aren't satisfied by just a data variable called 'test'
-  when first.o wants a function called 'test'. The Solaris compiler says
-  "ld: warning: symbol `test' has differing types:" while the AIX compiler
-  downright rejects it.
+- ossl_seed: no more RAND_screen
   
-  2) Test case 1119 that was added after this test is way more complete
-  and cover everything test 580 does and more without introducing the same
-  problems.
+  RAND_screen() is slow, not thread-safe and not needed anymore since OpenSSL
+  uses the thread-safe win32 CryptoAPI nowadays.

+  SMTP: add brackets for MAIL FROM
   
-  If you use a custom Host: name in a request to a SSL server, libcurl
-  will now use that given name when it verifies the server certificate to
-  be correct rather than using the host name used in the actual URL.
+  Similar to what is done already for RCPT TO, the code now checks for and
+  adds angle brackets (<>) around the email address that is provided for
+  CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT unless the app has done so itself.

-- runtests: allow tests written as perl scripts

-  If a command is set type="perl", it can now specify a perl program that will
-  be run instead of an ordinary curl or built tool.
+  Make the c-ares resolver code ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses when
+  IPv6 is enabled.
   
-  A perl test automatically disables memory and valgrind debugging.
-
-- symbol-scan: verifies symbols-in-versions
+  This is a workaround for the missing ares_getaddrinfo() and is a lot
+  easier to implement.
   
-  This new script scans for all enums and #defines used by the curl/curl.h
-  and curl/multi.h headers. Then it reads all symbols mentioned in
-  symbols-in-vesions and make sure that there's no entries missing in
-  there. It then proceeds to verify that the entries that
-  symbols-in-vesions mentions but aren't found in the sources are truly
-  documented as removed.
+  Note that as long as c-ares returns IPv4 addresses when IPv6 addresses
+  were requested but missing, this will cause a host's IPv4 addresses to
+  occur twice in the DNS cache.
   
-  This script is used in the new test case 1119
+  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-12/0041.html
 
-- symbols-in-versions: added 119 missing symbols
-  
-  I've developed a script I call symbol-scan.pl that scans the curl.h and
-  multi.h header files and compare the symbols it finds in there with the
-  symbols symbols-in-versions documents and outputs a report on the
-  differences.  Using this I've dug through the history to fill up
-  symbols-in-versions with all the symbols my script found mismatches for.
-  
-  I will commit symbol-scan.pl separatly and think of a way to put it to
-  use in the build/tests so that we from now on will get this in-sync
-  check automatically.

-- formdata: provide error message
-  
-  When failing to build form post due to an error, the code now does a

-- URL-parsing: consider ? a divider
-  
-  The URL parser got a little stricter as it now considers a ? to be a

-  problem that made me do this change was the reported problem with an URL
-  like: www.example.com?email=name@example.com This form of URL is not
-  really a legal URL (due to the missing slash after the host name) but is
-  widely accepted by all major browsers and libcurl also already accepted
-  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
+  Docs: add simple SMTP example
   
-  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the
-  ?  letter as part of user-name or password when given in the URL, which
-  it used to accept (and is tested in test 191). That letter is however
-  mentioned in RFC3986 to be required to be percent encoded since it is
-  used as a divider.

-  If the filename contains a backslash, only use filename portion. The

-  separators probably want that path removed for convenience.
+  The generic timeout code must not check easy handles that are already

-  As the change in 5f0ae7a0626cbe709 added a precaution against negative
-  file sizes that for some reason managed to get returned, this change now
-  introduces the same check at the second place in the code where the file
-  size from the libssh2 stat call is used.
-  
-  This check might not be suitable for a 32 bit curl_off_t, but libssh2.h

-  CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL) is used for ldap queries like
-  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/... You are unable to successfully execute the

-  and proxy is totally ignored. This is true for both openLDAP and

-  Step to reproduce the error:
-  Just launch "curl --proxytunnel --proxy 192.168.1.1:8080
-  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/dc=... "
+  CURLOPT_RESOLVE is a new option that sends along a curl_slist with
+  name:port:address sets that will populate the DNS cache with entries so
+  that request can be "fooled" to use another host than what otherwise
+  would've been used. Previously we've encouraged the use of Host: for
+  that when dealing with HTTP, but this new feature has the added bonus
+  that it allows the name from the URL to be used for TLS SNI and server
+  certificate name checks as well.
   
-  This fix adds an invocation to Curl_proxyCONNECT against the provided
-  proxy address and on successful "CONNECT" it tunnels ldap query to the
-  final ldap server through the HTTP proxy. As far as I know Microsoft
-  LDAP APIs don't permit tunnelling in any way so the patch provided is
-  for OpenLDAP only.  The patch has been developed against OpenLDAP 2.4.23
-  and has been tested with Microsoft ISA Server 2006 and works properly

+  These haven't worked in at least 8 years due to missing source
+  files, and most active RiscOS developers these days apparently

-  Fixed a bug in socket_action introduced recently when looping over timed
-  out handles: it wouldn't assign the 'data' variable and thus it wouldn't
-  properly take care of handles.
+  Signed-off-by: James Bursa <james@zamez.org>
+
+- Lightened the stack in wc_statemach to permit deeper recursion
   
-  In the update_timer function, the code now checks if the timeout has
-  been removed and then it tells the application. Previously it would
-  always let the remaining timeout(s) just linger to expire later on.
+  Also, added a few hints to help compilers to perform tail call

-  Curl_expire() set to 0 expires ALL timeouts so it should only be called
-  if we truly and really want to remove all timeouts for the handle.
+  In libssh2 1.2.8, libssh2_session_handshake() replaces
+  libssh2_session_startup() to fix the previous portability problem with
+  the socket type that was too small for win64 and thus easily could cause
+  crashes and more.
 
-- resolve_server: simplify code
+- SSH: avoid using the libssh2_ prefix
   
-  Make use of the helper function Curl_timeleft() instead of duplicating
-  code.
+  It is a bad idea to use the public prefix used by another library and
+  now we realize that libssh2 introduces a symbol in the upcoming version
+  1.2.8 that conflicts with our static function named libssh2_free.
 
-- multi: make sure the next timeout is used when one expires
+- formdata: provide error message
   
-  Each easy handle has a list of timeouts, so as soon as the main timeout
-  for a handle expires, we must make sure to get the next entry from the
-  list and re-add the handle to the splay tree.
+  When failing to build form post due to an error, the code now does a
+  proper failf(). Previously libcurl would report an error like "failed
+  creating formpost data" when a file wasn't possible to open which was

-- CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY: don't use with CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH

+  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
+  
+  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the

-- http: handle trailer headers in all chunked responses
+  CMake: Build fix.
   
-  HTTP allows that a server sends trailing headers after all the chunks

-  headers. The "Trailer:" header is only a SHOULD there and as we need to
-  handle the situation even without that header I made libcurl ignore
-  Trailer: completely.
+  Do not match the trailing '\n' in the regular expression as this would

+- SFTP: more ignoring negative file sizes

+  As the change in 5f0ae7a0626cbe709 added a precaution against negative

-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-08/0242.html
+  This check might not be suitable for a 32 bit curl_off_t, but libssh2.h

-- cmdline: make -F type= accept ;charset=

-  The -F option allows some custom parameters within the given string, and
-  those strings are separated with semicolons. You can for example specify

-  field. However, the use of semicolons like that made it not work fine if
-  you specified one within the content-type, like for:
-  "name=daniel;type=text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
-  ... as the second one would be seen as a separator and "charset" is no
-  parameter curl knows anything about so it was just silently discarded.
+- SMTP: debug output for no known auth mechanisms supported
   
-  The new logic now checks if the semicolon and following keyword looks
-  like a parameter it knows about and if it isn't it is assumed to be

-Guenter Knauf (20 Aug 2010)
-- Added mk-ca-bundle.vbs script.
+  Having a closing brace too many caused a silent error to occur, which

+  was shown. It does now!
   
-  The script works exactly same as the Perl one except for one thing:
-  when the text descriptions generated with openssl are included then
-  the md5 fingerprints are missing; seems openssl has either a bug or
-  a feature which prints the md5 fingerprint output to stdout instead
-  of writing them to specified file; this script could here do the same
-  as what the Perl scripr does (redirect stdout into file) but this
-  makes the script take up double the time because it needs to launch
-  cmd.exe 140 times (fo each openssl call). So I think for now we just
-  ommit the md5 fingerprints, and see if openssl will be fixed.

-- multi: two fixes done
+- [Dan Fandrich brought this change]
 
-- multi: use timeouts properly for MAX_RECV/SEND_SPEED
+  sws: Added writedelay HTTP server command
   
-  When detecting that the send or recv speed, the multi interface changes
-  state to TOOFAST and previously there was no timeout set that would
-  force a recheck but it would rely on the application to somehow call
-  libcurl anyway. This now sets a timeout for a suitable future time to
-  check again if the average transfer speed is then below the threshold
-  again.
+  This delays between write operations, hopefully making it easier
+  to spot problems where libcurl doesn't flush the socket properly
+  before waiting for the next response.
 
-- multi: support timeouts
-  
-  Curl_expire() is now expanded to hold a list of timeouts for each easy
-  handle. Only the closest in time will be the one used as the primary
-  timeout for the handle and will be used for the splay tree (which sorts
-  and lists all handles within the multi handle).
-  
-  When the main timeout has triggered/expired, the next timeout in time
-  that is kept in the list will be moved to the main timeout position and
-  used as the key to splay with. This way, all timeouts that are set with
-  Curl_expire() internally will end up as a proper timeout. Previously any
-  Curl_expire() that set a _later_ timeout than what was already set was
-  just silently ignored and thus missed.
-  
-  Setting Curl_expire() with timeout 0 (zero) will cancel all previously
-  added timeouts.
+- TODO-RELEASE: no bug in ftp_nextconnect
   
-  Corrects known bug #62.
+  The issue named "266 - Bug in ftp_nextconnect?" was deemed to not be a
+  bug and instead resulted in clarified docs.
 
-- Curl_llist_insert_next: allow insertion first in the list
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY implies dir list
   
-  When we specify the "insert after" entry as NULL, this function now
-  inserts the new entry first in the list.
+  Make it explicit that setting CURLOPT_DIRLISTONLY to 1 will make libcurl
+  to list the directory.
 
-- multi: make curl_multi_info_read perform O(1)
-  
-  Instead of looping over all attached easy handles, this now keeps a list
-  of messages in the multi handle. It allows curl_multi_info_read() to
-  perform O(1) no matter how many easy handles that are handled. This is
-  of importance since this function may be polled very frequently by apps
-  using the multi interface.

-  - added rule for hugehelp.c.cvs so that it will be created when not

-  The curl-config now features a --built-shared command line option that
-  will output 'yes' or 'no' depending if the build process was asked to
-  build shared library/libraries or not.
+  As of curl-7.21.1 tunnelling ldap queries through HTTP Proxies is not
+  supported. Actually if --proxytunnel command-line option (or equivalent
+  CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL) is used for ldap queries like
+  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/... You are unable to successfully execute the
+  query. In facts ldap_*_bind is executed directly against the ldap server
+  and proxy is totally ignored. This is true for both openLDAP and
+  Microsoft LDAP API.
   
-  It is primarily made to offer more details to the test suite to know
-  what kind of stunts it can expect to work.
+  Step to reproduce the error:
+  Just launch "curl --proxytunnel --proxy 192.168.1.1:8080
+  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/dc=... "
+  
+  This fix adds an invocation to Curl_proxyCONNECT against the provided
+  proxy address and on successful "CONNECT" it tunnels ldap query to the
+  final ldap server through the HTTP proxy. As far as I know Microsoft
+  LDAP APIs don't permit tunnelling in any way so the patch provided is

+Dan Fandrich (11 Sep 2010)
+- Link curl and the test apps with -lrt explicitly when necessary
   
-  curl_multi perform has two phases: run through every easy handle calling
-  multi_runsingle and remove expired timers (timer removal).
+  When curl calls a function from that library then it needs to
+  explicitly link to the library instead of piggybacking on
+  libcurl's own dependency.  Without this, GNU ld with the
+  --no-add-needed flag fails when linking (which Fedora now does
+  by default).
   
-  If a small timer (e.g. 1-10ms) is set during multi_runsingle, then it's
-  possible that the timer has passed by when the timer removal runs. The
-  timer which was just added is then removed. This will potentially cause
-  the timer list to be empty and cause the next call to curl_multi_timeout
-  to return -1. Ideally, curl_multi_timeout should return 0 in this case.

-  Since uploading from stdin is very likely to not work with anyauth and

-  the user about it. Multi-phase negotiate almost certainly will involve
-  sending data and thus libcurl will need to rewind the stream to send

-- http: don't enable chunked during authentication negotiations
-  
-  As mentioned in bug report #2956968, the HTTP code wouldn't send the
-  first empty chunk during the auth negotiation phase of the HTTP request
-  sending, so the server would wait for data to come and libcurl would
-  wait for data to arrive... I've made the code not enable chunked

+- multi: fixes for timing out handles
   
-  it makes the --libcurl output easier to follow.
+  Add a timeout check for handles in the state machine so that they will
+  timeout in all states disregarding what actions that may or may not
+  happen.
+  
+  Fixed a bug in socket_action introduced recently when looping over timed
+  out handles: it wouldn't assign the 'data' variable and thus it wouldn't
+  properly take care of handles.
+  
+  In the update_timer function, the code now checks if the timeout has
+  been removed and then it tells the application. Previously it would
+  always let the remaining timeout(s) just linger to expire later on.
 
-- --libcurl: hide setopt() calls setting default options
+- threaded resolver: no more expire 0 calls
   
-  And additionally, don't show function or object pointers actual value
-  since they make no sense to anyone. Show 'functionpointer' and
-  'objectpointer' instead.
+  Curl_expire() set to 0 expires ALL timeouts so it should only be called
+  if we truly and really want to remove all timeouts for the handle.
 
-- --libcurl: use *_LARGE options with typecasted constants
+- resolve_server: simplify code
   
-  In the generated code --libcurl makes, all calls to curl_easy_setopt()
-  that use *_LARGE options now have the value typecasted to curl_off_t, so
-  that it works correctly for 32bit systems with 64bit curl_off_t type.
+  Make use of the helper function Curl_timeleft() instead of duplicating
+  code.
 
-- multi: CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET doesn't work after remove_handle
+- multi: make sure the next timeout is used when one expires
   
-  When curl_multi_remove_handle() is called and an easy handle is returned
-  to the connection cache held in the multi handle, then we cannot allow
-  CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to extract it since that will more or less encourage
-  that the user uses the socket while it can get used by libcurl again.
+  Each easy handle has a list of timeouts, so as soon as the main timeout
+  for a handle expires, we must make sure to get the next entry from the
+  list and re-add the handle to the splay tree.
   
-  Without this fix, we'd get a segfault in Curl_getconnectinfo() trying to
-  dereference the NULL pointer in 'data->state.connc'.
+  This was attempted previously but was done poorly in my commit
+  232ad6549a68450.

+  expire for the multi interface if they are set for the handle. This is a

+- HISTORY: mention the gopher story
+
+Dan Fandrich (25 Aug 2010)
+- Tweaked some test data files
   
-  In order to get it working, curl_global_init() must be called with
-  CURL_GLOBAL_SSL or CURL_GLOBAL_ALL.  That's necessary because NSS needs
-  to be initialized globally and we do so only when the NSS library is
-  actually required by protocol.  The mentioned call of curl_global_init()
-  is responsible for creating of the initialization mutex.
-  
-  There was also slightly changed the NSS initialization scenario, in
-  particular, loading of the NSS PEM module.  It used to be loaded always
-  right after the NSS library was initialized.  Now the library is
-  initialized as soon as any SSL or NTLM is required, while the PEM module
-  is prevented from being loaded until the SSL is actually required.
+  Fixed some issues that caused xmllint failures, added features
+  and keywords, fixed some quotes and removed some <strip> sections
+  that unnecessarily limited test checking.

-- multi_socket: re-use of same socket without notifying app
-  
-  When a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses and the first one
-  tried doesn't work, the socket for the second attempt may get dropped on
-  the floor, causing the request to eventually time out. The issue is that
-  when using kqueue (as on mac and bsd platforms) instead of select, the
-  kernel removes the first fd from kqueue when it is closed (in trynextip,
-  connect.c:503). Trynextip() then goes on to open a new socket, which
-  gets assigned the same number as the one it just closed. Later in
-  multi.c, socket_cb is not called because the fd is already in
-  multi->sockhash, so the new socket is never added to kqueue.
-  
-  The correct fix is to ensure that socket_cb is called to remove the fd
-  when trynextip() closes the socket, and again to re-add it after
-  singleipsocket(). I'm not sure how to cleanly do that, but the attached
-  patch works around the problem in an admittedly kludgy way by delaying
-  the close to ensure that the newly-opened socket gets a different fd.

-  OpenSSL: fix spurious SSL connection aborts
-  
-  Was seeing spurious SSL connection aborts using libcurl and
-  OpenSSL. I tracked it down to uncleared error state on the
-  OpenSSL error stack - patch attached deals with that.
-  
-  Rough idea of problem:
-  
-  Code that uses libcurl calls some library that uses OpenSSL but
-  don't clear the OpenSSL error stack after an error.
-  
-  ssluse.c calls SSL_read which eventually gets an EWOULDBLOCK from
-  the OS. Returns -1 to indicate an error
-  
-  ssluse.c calls SSL_get_error. First thing, SSL_get_error calls
-  ERR_get_error to check the OpenSSL error stack, finds an old
-  error and returns SSL_ERROR_SSL instead of SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or
-  SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.
+- multi: two fixes done
+
+- multi: use timeouts properly for MAX_RECV/SEND_SPEED
   
-  ssluse.c returns an error and aborts the connection
+  When detecting that the send or recv speed, the multi interface changes
+  state to TOOFAST and previously there was no timeout set that would
+  force a recheck but it would rely on the application to somehow call
+  libcurl anyway. This now sets a timeout for a suitable future time to
+  check again if the average transfer speed is then below the threshold
+  again.
+
+- multi: support timeouts
   
-  Solution:
+  Curl_expire() is now expanded to hold a list of timeouts for each easy
+  handle. Only the closest in time will be the one used as the primary
+  timeout for the handle and will be used for the splay tree (which sorts
+  and lists all handles within the multi handle).
   
-  Clear the openssl error stack before calling SSL_* operation if
-  we're going to call SSL_get_error afterwards.
+  When the main timeout has triggered/expired, the next timeout in time
+  that is kept in the list will be moved to the main timeout position and
+  used as the key to splay with. This way, all timeouts that are set with
+  Curl_expire() internally will end up as a proper timeout. Previously any
+  Curl_expire() that set a _later_ timeout than what was already set was
+  just silently ignored and thus missed.
   
-  Notes:
+  Setting Curl_expire() with timeout 0 (zero) will cancel all previously
+  added timeouts.
   
-  This is much more likely to happen with multi because it's easier
-  to intersperse other calls to the OpenSSL library in the same
-  thread.

-  getinfo: added *_PRIMARY_PORT, *_LOCAL_IP and *_LOCAL_PORT
+- multi: make curl_multi_info_read perform O(1)
+  
+  Instead of looping over all attached easy handles, this now keeps a list
+  of messages in the multi handle. It allows curl_multi_info_read() to
+  perform O(1) no matter how many easy handles that are handled. This is
+  of importance since this function may be polled very frequently by apps
+  using the multi interface.

-- SSH: corrected the inability to respect the timeout
+- runtests: clear old setenv remainders before test
   
-  Jason McDonald posted bug report #3006786 when he found that the
-  SFTP code didn't timeout properly in several places in the code
-  even if a timeout was set properly.
+  Due to the layout of the singletest function there are situations where
+  it returns before it clears the environment variables that were
+  especially set for the single specific test case. That could lead to
+  subsequent tests getting executed with environment variables sticking
+  around from a previous test which could lead to badness.
   
-  Based on his suggested patch, I wrote a different implementation
-  that I think addressed the issue better and also uses the connect
-  timeout for the initial part of the SSH/SFTP done during the
-  "protocol connect" phase.
+  This change makes sure to clear all custom variables that may be laying
+  around from a previous round, before running a test case.

-- multi_socket: handles timer inaccuracy better for timeouts
-  
-  Igor Novoseltsev reported a problem with the multi socket API and
-  using timeouts and timers. It boiled down to a problem with
-  libcurl's use of GetTickCount() interally to figure out the
-  current time, while Igor's own application code used another
-  function call.
+- warning: silence the compiler
   
-  It made his app call the socket API timeout function a bit
-  _before_ libcurl would consider the timeout to trigger, and that
-  could easily lead to timeouts or stalls in the app. It seems
-  GetTickCount() in general often has no better resolution than
-  16ms and switching to the alternative function
-  QueryPerformanceCounter has its share of problems:
-  http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=106
+  warning: conversion to 'long int' from 'time_t' may alter its value
   
-  We address this problem by simply having libcurl treat timers
-  that already has occured or will occur within 40ms subject for
-  treatment. I'm confident that there are other implementations and
-  operating systems with similarly in accurate timer functions so
-  it makes sense to have applied generically and I don't believe we
-  sacrifice much by adding a 40ms inaccuracy on these timeouts.
+  ... on win64 when time_t is 64bit and long is 32bit.

+  ->protocol field isn't right since when an FTP:// URL is sent over a
+  HTTP proxy, the protocol is HTTP but the URL was handled by the FTP code
+  and thus slash_removed is set TRUE for this case.

-- TFTP: send legal timeout value
-  
-  Eric Mertens posted bug #3003705: when we made TFTP use the
-  correct timeout option when sent to the server (fixed May 18th
-  2010) it became obvious that libcurl used invalid timeout values
-  (300 by default while the RFC allows nothing above 255). While of
-  course it is obvious that as TFTP has worked thus far without
-  being able to set timeout at all, just removing the setting
-  wouldn't make any difference in behavior. I decided to still keep
-  it (but fix the problem) as it now actually allows for easier
-  (future) customization of the timeout.

+Daniel Stenberg (25 Jul 2010)
+- curl-config: --built-shared returns shared info
   
-  John-Mark Bell filed bug #3000052 that identified a problem (with
-  an associated patch) with the OpenSSL handshake state machine
-  when the multi interface is used:
+  The curl-config now features a --built-shared command line option that
+  will output 'yes' or 'no' depending if the build process was asked to
+  build shared library/libraries or not.
   
-  Performing an https request using a curl multi handle and using
-  select or epoll to wait for events results in a hang. It appears
-  that the cause is the fix for bug #2958179, which makes
-  ossl_connect_common unconditionally return from the step 2 loop
-  when fetching from a multi handle.
+  It is primarily made to offer more details to the test suite to know
+  what kind of stunts it can expect to work.
+
+- add_buffer_send: fix compiler warning
   
-  When ossl_connect_step2 has completed, it updates
-  connssl->connecting_state to ssl_connect_3. ossl_connect_common
-  will then return to the caller, as a multi handle is in
-  use. Eventually, the client code will call curl_multi_fdset to
-  obtain an updated fdset to select or epoll on. For https
-  requests, curl_multi_fdset will cause https_getsock to be called.
-  https_getsock will only return a socket handle if the
-  connecting_state is ssl_connect_2_reading or
-  ssl_connect_2_writing.  Therefore, the client will never obtain a
-  valid fdset, and thus not drive the multi handle, resulting in a
-  hang.

-  work with FTPS fine.
+  curl_multi perform has two phases: run through every easy handle calling

-  This commit fixes the FTPS regression introduced in change d64bd82.
+  If a small timer (e.g. 1-10ms) is set during multi_runsingle, then it's
+  possible that the timer has passed by when the timer removal runs. The
+  timer which was just added is then removed. This will potentially cause
+  the timer list to be empty and cause the next call to curl_multi_timeout
+  to return -1. Ideally, curl_multi_timeout should return 0 in this case.
+  
+  One way to fix this is to move the struct timeval now = Curl_tvnow(); to
+  the top of curl_multi_perform. The change does that.

-  Kalle Vahlman's patch applied a while ago broke how the findtool

+- upload: warn users trying to upload from stdin with anyauth
   
-  I noticed when it found 'libtool' in the current directory but

+  Since uploading from stdin is very likely to not work with anyauth and
+  its multi-phase probing for what authentication to actually use, alert

-- multi interface: missed storing connection time
+- --libcurl: list the tricky options instead of using [REMARK]
   
-  Dirk Manske reported a regression. When connecting with the multi
-  interface, there were situations where libcurl wouldn't store
-  connect time correctly as it used to (and is documented to) do.
+  I think the [REMARK] and commented function calls cluttered the code a
+  bit too much and made the generated code ugly to read. Now we instead
+  track the remarks one specially and just lists them at the end of the
+  generated code more as additional information.
+
+- curl: avoid setting libcurl options to its default
   
-  Using his fine sample program we could repeat it, and I wrote up
-  test case 573 using that code. The problem does not easily show
-  itself using the local test suite though.
+  it makes the --libcurl output easier to follow.
+
+- --libcurl: hide setopt() calls setting default options
   
-  The fix, also as suggested by Dirk, is a bit on the ugly side as
-  it adds yet another call to Curl_verboseconnect() and setting the
-  TIMER_CONNECT time.  That situation is subject for some closer
-  inspection in the future.
+  And additionally, don't show function or object pointers actual value
+  since they make no sense to anyone. Show 'functionpointer' and
+  'objectpointer' instead.
 
-- verboseconnect: so the verbose checking within the function
+- --libcurl: use *_LARGE options with typecasted constants
   
-  As the function is used more than once and libcurl can be built
-  without it, do the conditional check within the verboseconnect()
-  function itself.
+  In the generated code --libcurl makes, all calls to curl_easy_setopt()
+  that use *_LARGE options now have the value typecasted to curl_off_t, so
+  that it works correctly for 32bit systems with 64bit curl_off_t type.
 
-- changelogs: split the I/O handling
+- multi: CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET doesn't work after remove_handle
+  
+  When curl_multi_remove_handle() is called and an easy handle is returned
+  to the connection cache held in the multi handle, then we cannot allow
+  CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to extract it since that will more or less encourage
+  that the user uses the socket while it can get used by libcurl again.
+  
+  Without this fix, we'd get a segfault in Curl_getconnectinfo() trying to
+  dereference the NULL pointer in 'data->state.connc'.

+- http_ntlm: add support for NSS
   
-  Howard Chu brought the bulk work of this patch that properly
-  moves out the sending and recving of data to the parts of the
-  code that are properly responsible for the various ways of doing
-  so.
+  When configured with '--without-ssl --with-nss', NTLM authentication
+  now uses NSS crypto library for MD5 and DES.  For MD4 we have a local
+  implementation in that case.  More details are available at
+  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/603783
   
-  Daniel Stenberg assisted with polishing a few bits and fixed some
-  minor flaws in the original patch.
+  In order to get it working, curl_global_init() must be called with
+  CURL_GLOBAL_SSL or CURL_GLOBAL_ALL.  That's necessary because NSS needs
+  to be initialized globally and we do so only when the NSS library is
+  actually required by protocol.  The mentioned call of curl_global_init()
+  is responsible for creating of the initialization mutex.
   
-  Another upside of this patch is that we now abuse CURLcodes less
-  with the "magic" -1 return codes and instead use CURLE_AGAIN more
-  consistently.
+  There was also slightly changed the NSS initialization scenario, in
+  particular, loading of the NSS PEM module.  It used to be loaded always
+  right after the NSS library was initialized.  Now the library is
+  initialized as soon as any SSL or NTLM is required, while the PEM module
+  is prevented from being loaded until the SSL is actually required.

+- multi_socket: re-use of same socket without notifying app
+  
+  When a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses and the first one
+  tried doesn't work, the socket for the second attempt may get dropped on
+  the floor, causing the request to eventually time out. The issue is that
+  when using kqueue (as on mac and bsd platforms) instead of select, the
+  kernel removes the first fd from kqueue when it is closed (in trynextip,
+  connect.c:503). Trynextip() then goes on to open a new socket, which
+  gets assigned the same number as the one it just closed. Later in
+  multi.c, socket_cb is not called because the fd is already in
+  multi->sockhash, so the new socket is never added to kqueue.
+  
+  The correct fix is to ensure that socket_cb is called to remove the fd
+  when trynextip() closes the socket, and again to re-add it after
+  singleipsocket(). I'm not sure how to cleanly do that, but the attached
+  patch works around the problem in an admittedly kludgy way by delaying
+  the close to ensure that the newly-opened socket gets a different fd.

+- multi: call the progress function only once and allow abort
   
-  The main change is to allow input from user-specified methods,
-  when they are specified with CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.
-  All calls to fflush(stdout) in telnet.c were removed, which makes
-  using 'curl telnet://foo.com' painful since prompts and other data
-  are not always returned to the user promptly.  Use
-  'curl --no-buffer telnet://foo.com' instead.  In general,
-  the user should have their CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION do a fflush
-  for interactive use.
+  1) no need to call the progress function twice when in the
+  CURLM_STATE_TOOFAST state.
   
-  Also fix assumption that reading from stdin never returns < 0.
-  Old code could crash in that case.
+  2) Make sure that the progress callback's return code is
+  acknowledged when used
+
+- multi: call the progress callback in all states
   
-  Call progress functions in telnet main loop.
+  As long as no error is reported, the progress function can get
+  called. This may be a little TOO often so we should keep an eye
+  on this and possibly make this conditional somehow.

+  OpenSSL: fix spurious SSL connection aborts
+  
+  Was seeing spurious SSL connection aborts using libcurl and
+  OpenSSL. I tracked it down to uncleared error state on the
+  OpenSSL error stack - patch attached deals with that.
+  
+  Rough idea of problem:
+  
+  Code that uses libcurl calls some library that uses OpenSSL but
+  don't clear the OpenSSL error stack after an error.
+  
+  ssluse.c calls SSL_read which eventually gets an EWOULDBLOCK from
+  the OS. Returns -1 to indicate an error
+  
+  ssluse.c calls SSL_get_error. First thing, SSL_get_error calls
+  ERR_get_error to check the OpenSSL error stack, finds an old
+  error and returns SSL_ERROR_SSL instead of SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or
+  SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.
+  
+  ssluse.c returns an error and aborts the connection
+  
+  Solution:
+  
+  Clear the openssl error stack before calling SSL_* operation if
+  we're going to call SSL_get_error afterwards.
+  
+  Notes:
+  
+  This is much more likely to happen with multi because it's easier
+  to intersperse other calls to the OpenSSL library in the same
+  thread.

+- multi_socket: handles timer inaccuracy better for timeouts
   
-  This function could only return CURLE_OK and by changing it to
-  a void instead, we can simplify code all over.
+  Igor Novoseltsev reported a problem with the multi socket API and
+  using timeouts and timers. It boiled down to a problem with
+  libcurl's use of GetTickCount() interally to figure out the
+  current time, while Igor's own application code used another
+  function call.
+  
+  It made his app call the socket API timeout function a bit
+  _before_ libcurl would consider the timeout to trigger, and that
+  could easily lead to timeouts or stalls in the app. It seems
+  GetTickCount() in general often has no better resolution than
+  16ms and switching to the alternative function
+  QueryPerformanceCounter has its share of problems:
+  http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=106
+  
+  We address this problem by simply having libcurl treat timers
+  that already has occured or will occur within 40ms subject for
+  treatment. I'm confident that there are other implementations and
+  operating systems with similarly in accurate timer functions so
+  it makes sense to have applied generically and I don't believe we
+  sacrifice much by adding a 40ms inaccuracy on these timeouts.

-  fix smtp compile warning
+  Performing an https request using a curl multi handle and using
+  select or epoll to wait for events results in a hang. It appears
+  that the cause is the fix for bug #2958179, which makes
+  ossl_connect_common unconditionally return from the step 2 loop
+  when fetching from a multi handle.
   
-  Use ssize_t instead of int for the Curl_smtp_escape_eob nread
-  argument.
+  When ossl_connect_step2 has completed, it updates
+  connssl->connecting_state to ssl_connect_3. ossl_connect_common
+  will then return to the caller, as a multi handle is in
+  use. Eventually, the client code will call curl_multi_fdset to
+  obtain an updated fdset to select or epoll on. For https
+  requests, curl_multi_fdset will cause https_getsock to be called.
+  https_getsock will only return a socket handle if the
+  connecting_state is ssl_connect_2_reading or
+  ssl_connect_2_writing.  Therefore, the client will never obtain a
+  valid fdset, and thus not drive the multi handle, resulting in a
+  hang.

+  Dirk Manske reported a regression. When connecting with the multi

+  
+  Using his fine sample program we could repeat it, and I wrote up
+  test case 573 using that code. The problem does not easily show
+  itself using the local test suite though.
   
-  That's the symbol we have or generate in include/curl/curlbuild.h
+  The fix, also as suggested by Dirk, is a bit on the ugly side as
+  it adds yet another call to Curl_verboseconnect() and setting the
+  TIMER_CONNECT time.  That situation is subject for some closer
+  inspection in the future.

-  fix: timeout after last data chunk was handled
+  telnet: Allow programatic use of telnet.
+  
+  The main change is to allow input from user-specified methods,
+  when they are specified with CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.
+  All calls to fflush(stdout) in telnet.c were removed, which makes
+  using 'curl telnet://foo.com' painful since prompts and other data
+  are not always returned to the user promptly.  Use
+  'curl --no-buffer telnet://foo.com' instead.  In general,
+  the user should have their CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION do a fflush
+  for interactive use.
   
-  Bob Richmond: There's an annoying situation where libcurl will
-  read new HTTP response data from a socket, then check if it's a
-  timeout if one is set. If the last packet received constitutes
-  the end of the response body, libcurl still treats it as a
-  timeout condition and reports a message like:
+  Also fix assumption that reading from stdin never returns < 0.
+  Old code could crash in that case.
   
-  "Operation timed out after 3000 milliseconds with 876 out of 876
-  bytes received"
+  Call progress functions in telnet main loop.
   
-  It should only a timeout if the timer lapsed and we DIDN'T
-  receive the end of the response body yet.

+- curl: -O crash on windows
   
-  This triggered a bug in the "delayed easy handle kill" system
-  that curl uses: when an FTP connection is left alive it must keep
-  an easy handle around internally - only for the purpose of having
-  an easy handle when it later disconnects it. The code assumed
-  that when the easy handle was removed and an internal reference
-  was made, that version could be killed later on when a new easy
-  handle came using the same connection. This was wrong as Hauke's
-  example showed that the removed handle wasn't killed for real
-  until later. This caused a double close attempt => segfault.

+- hmac.c related compilation adjustment
 
-  fix the alarm()-based DNS timeout
-  
-  Looking at the code of Curl_resolv_timeout() in hostip.c, I think
-  that in case of a timeout, the signal handler for SIGALRM never
-  gets removed. I think that in my case it gets executed at some
-  point later on when execution has long left Curl_resolv_timeout()
-  or even the cURL library.
-  
-  The code that is jumped to with siglongjmp() simply sets the
-  error message to "name lookup timed out" and then returns with
-  CURLRESOLV_ERROR. I guess that instead of simply returning
-  without cleaning up, the code should have a goto that jumps to
-  the spot right after the call to Curl_resolv().

-  CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION and CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION more consistent
+Daniel Stenberg (16 Apr 2010)
+- changelog: GnuTLS fix, no reverse loopkups and fixed GSS detection
 
-- - [Daniel Johnson] I've been trying to build libcurl with clang on Darwin and
-    ran into some issues with the GSSAPI tests in configure.ac. The tests first
-    try to determine the include dirs and libs and set CPPFLAGS and LIBS
-    accordingly. It then checks for the headers and finally sets LIBS a second
-    time, causing the libs to be included twice. The first setting of LIBS seems
-    redundant and should be left out, since the first part is otherwise just
-    about finding headers.
+- SSL_RECV: EOF is not an error here
   
-    My second issue is that 'krb5-config --libs gssapi' on Darwin is less than
-    useless and returns junk that, while it happens to work with gcc, causes
-    clang to choke. For example, --libs returns $CFLAGS along with the libs,
-    which is really retarded. Simply setting 'LIBS="$LIBS -lgssapi_krb5
-    -lresolv"' on Darwin is sufficient.
-
-- - Based on patch provided by Jacob Moshenko, the transfer logic now properly
-    makes sure that when using sub-second timeouts, there's no final bad 1000ms
-    wait. Previously, a sub-second timeout would often make the elapsed time end
-    up the time rounded up to the nearest second (e.g. 1s for 200ms timeout)
+  The recent overhaul of the SSL recv function made this treat a
+  zero returned from gnutls_record_recv() as an error, and this
+  caused our HTTPS test cases to fail. We leave it to upper layer
+  code to detect if an EOF is a problem or not.
 
-- update the generic copyright year range to include 2010
+- [Paul Howarth brought this change]
 
-- - Andrei Benea filed bug report #2956698 and pointed out that the
-    CURLOPT_CERTINFO feature leaked memory due to a missing OpenSSL function
-    call. He provided the patch to fix it too.
+  configure: GSSAPI detection on ancient Linux distros
   
-    http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2956698
-
-- - Markus Duft pointed out in bug #2961796 that even though Interix has a
-    poll() function it doesn't quite work the way we want it so we must disable
-    it, and he also provided a patch for it.
+  On some ancient distributions such as RHEL-3, <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h> needs
+  to be processed after <gssapi/gssapi.h>, but does not include it itself.
+  This patch checks for <gssapi/gssapi.h> first and then includes it
+  in the test for <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h>, resolving the problem.
   
-    http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2961796
+  Without the patch, <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h> is "present but cannot be
+  compiled".
 
-- - Made the pingpong timeout code properly deal with the response timeout AND
-    the global timeout if set. Also, as was reported in the bug report #2956437
-    by Ryan Chan, the time stamp to use as basis for the per command timeout was
-    not set properly in the DONE phase for FTP (and not for SMTP) so I fixed
-    that just now. This was a regression compared to 7.19.7 due to the
-    conversion of FTP code over to the generic pingpong concepts.
+- resolvers: no more using AI_CANONNAME
   
-    http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2956437
-
-- remove assignment never used
-
-- - Ben Greear provided an update for TFTP that fixes upload.
-
-- SSL, not SSH, SSL
+  No resolver anymore needs to use AI_CANONNAME and do reverse
+  lookups.  We should work hard to avoid having code that relies on
+  it.
 
-- - Wesley Miaw reported bug #2958179 which identified a case of looping during
-    OpenSSL based SSL handshaking even though the multi interface was used and
-    there was no good reason for it.
+- KRB5: use given host name instead of reverse lookup'ed name
   
-    http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2958179
-
-Yang Tse (28 Feb 2010)
-- Added SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_SHORT definitions for non-configure systems
-
-- Added ares_nowarn.* to VC6 project file
+  This code would previously use dns_entry->addr->ai_canonname
+  instead of the given host name, which caused us grief and
+  problems since not all our resolver options do the reverse lookup
+  and I would also guess that it caused problems with KRB5/GSS with
+  virtual name-based hosts. Now the host name from the URL is used.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (26 Feb 2010)

+Dan Fandrich (15 Apr 2010)

-- convert Curl_ultous() and Curl_ultouc() functions to curlx_ultous() and
-  curlx_ultouc(), exposing them through curlx.h to allow proper code reuse
-  later in our test harness.
+- Curl_ipv4_resolve_r: only set AI_CANONNAME when needed
+  
+  As reported in bug report #2987196, the code for ipv6 already did
+  the setting of this bit correctly so we copied that logic into
+  the Curl_ipv4_resolve_r() function as well. KRB code is the only
+  code we know that might need the cannonical name so only resolve
+  it for such requests!
 
-- updated sources
+- IGNORE: files generated by maketgz
 
-Patrick Monnerat (22 Feb 2010)
-- _ Adjusted RFC821 HELO fallback and enabled test804
+- bumped to start the journey towards 7.20.2
 
-- - Proper handling of STARTTLS on SMTP, taking CURLUSESSL_TRY into account.
-  - SMTP falls back to RFC821 HELO when EHLO fails (and SSL is not required).
-  - Use of true local host name (i.e.: via gethostname()) when available, as default argument to SMTP HELO/EHLO.
-  - Test case 804 for HELO fallback.

-- TFTP transfers are not blocking since 7.20.0
+Yang Tse (13 Apr 2010)
+- fix compiler warning: variable might be clobbered by longjmp or vfork
 
-- - Fixed the SMTP compliance by making sure RCPT TO addresses are specified
-    properly in angle brackets. Recipients provided with CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT now
-    get angle bracket wrapping automatically by libcurl unless the recipient
-    starts with an angle bracket as then the app is assumed to deal with that
-    properly on its own.
-
-- - I made the SMTP code expect a 250 response back from the server after the
-    full DATA has been sent, and I modified the test SMTP server to also send
-    that response. As usual, the DONE operation that is made after a completed
-    transfer is still not doable in a non-blocking way so this waiting for 250
-    is unfortunately made blockingly.
+Guenter Knauf (13 Apr 2010)
+- added last git commit output for c-ares too.
 
-- corected a comment and wrapped a few longish lines

-  - To allow an app to force a re-read of /etc/resolv.conf etc, pretty much
-    like the res_init() resolver function offers
-
-- use curl standard indentation and line lengths
-
-Yang Tse (16 Feb 2010)
-- replaced tabs with spaces
+  The section that describes how to work with timeouts was
+  misleading and could easily trick users to use the wrong API.
 
-- fix Content-Length validation
+- update URL and cut out wrong info on ipv6
+  
+  c-ares has had its own URL for a while and we should point
+  people to that. It also works with IPv6 since a long time.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (15 Feb 2010)
-- use (void) in front of fwrite() calls that ignore the return code
+- refer to CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION for multi_socket users
+  
+  curl_multi_timeout(3) is simply the wrong function to use
+  if you're using the multi_socket API and this document now
+  states this pretty clearly to help guiding users.

+  subtree within the curl tree anymore...

-Daniel Stenberg (13 Feb 2010)
-- - Tom Donovan fixed the CURL_FORMAT_* defines when building with cmake.
+- refactorize interface of Curl_ssl_recv/Curl_ssl_send
 
-- - Jack Zhang reported a problem with SMTP: we wrongly used multiple addresses
-    in the same RCPT TO line, when they should be sent in separate single
-    commands. I updated test case 802 to verify this.
-  
-  - I also fixed a bad use of my_setopt_str() of CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT in the curl
-    tool which made it try to output it as string for the --libcurl feature
-    which could lead to crashes.
+- simplify code of Curl_resolv_timeout()
 
-- CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT is *not* a string so we must not try to printf() it

+
+  When passing on a URL to curl to use, it may respond that the particular

+  is phrased is because curl doesn't make a distinction internally of whether
+  a particular protocol is not supported (ie never got any code added that
+  knows how to speak that protocol) or if it was explicitly disabled. curl can
+  be built to only support a given set of protocols, and the rest would then

+ Most FTP proxy servers are set up to appear as a normal FTP server from the

+ curl supports the -u, -Q and --ftp-account options that can be used to
+ set up transfers through many FTP proxies. For example, a file can be
+ uploaded to a remote FTP server using a Blue Coat FTP proxy with the
+ options:
+
+   curl -u "Remote-FTP-Username@remote.ftp.server Proxy-Username:Remote-Pass" \

+ See the manual for your FTP proxy to determine the form it expects to set up
+ transfers, and curl's -v option to see exactly what curl is sending.

 RANGES
 
   With HTTP 1.1 byte-ranges were introduced. Using this, a client can request
   to get only one or more subparts of a specified document. Curl supports
   this with the -r flag.
