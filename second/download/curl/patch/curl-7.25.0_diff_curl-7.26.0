+- smtp: Fixed an issue with the multi-interface always sending postdata

+  Due to the result code being reset to CURLE_OK when smtp_dophase_done()
+  was called, postdata would incorrectly be sent to the server when the
+  MAIL FROM or RCPT command was rejected.
+  
+  As such, libcurl would return the wrong result code from performing the

+  returned by the postdata command.

+  
+  In nettle/md5.h, md5_init and md5_update are defined as macros to
+  nettle_md5_init and nettle_md5_update respectively.  This causes
+  error when using MD5_params.md5_init and md5_update.  This patch

+  
+  The changes in curl_ntlm_core.c is conversion error and fixed by

-  Use fopen() with "w" mode instead of "wt" to fix cygwin builds.
+  A dot character at the beginning of a line would not be escaped to a
+  double dot as required by RFC-2821, instead it would be deleted by the
+  mail server. Please see section 4.5.2 of the RFC for more information.

+  Note: This fix also simplifies the detection of repeated CRLF.CRLF

-- cmake: list_spaces_append_once fails with spaces in filename
+  autoconf: improve handling of versioned symbols
   
-  Windows standard libraries are located in C:/Program Files/Microsoft
-  SDKs/[...]. They are already included in the default MSVC
-  LIBPATH. Hence, find_library(WSOCK32_LIBRARY wsock32) and
-  find_library(WS2_32_LIBRARY ws2_32) are not needed. They return the full
-  path to the libraries including spaces. Of course,
-  list_spaces_append_once will mangle the result and the build fails.
+  It checks whether versioned symbols should be enabled before checking
+  whether it is possible (i.e. the linker supports --version-script) or
+  not. This avoids a useless warning when building cURL on a platform that
+  does not use GNU ld.

+- URL parse: reject numerical IPv6 addresses outside brackets
   
-  An alternative would be:
+  Roman Mamedov spotted (in
+  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=670126) that curl would
+  not complain when given a URL with an IPv6 numerical address without
+  brackets. It would simply cut off the last ":[hex]" part and thus not
+  work correctly.
   
-  1. specify HTTPS_CA_DIR and/or HTTPS_CA_FILE
-  2. ensure that Net::SSL is being used, and IO::Socket::SSL is NOT being
-     used
+  That's a URL using an illegal syntax and now libcurl will instead return
+  a clear error code and error message detailing the error.
   
-  This question and answer explain:
-  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/74358/
+  The above mentioned bug report claims this to be a regression but
+  libcurl does not guarantee functionality when given URLs that aren't
+  following the URL spec (RFC3986 mostly). I consider the fact that it
+  used to handle this differently a mere coincidence.

-- CONNECT: fix ipv6 address in the Request-Line
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Apr 2012)
+- HTTP: empty chunked POST ended up in two zero size chunks
   
-  Commit 466150bc64d fixed the Host: header with CONNECT, but I then
-  forgot the preceeding request-line. Now this too uses [brackets]
-  properly if a ipv6 numerical address was given.
+  When doing a chunked-encoded POST with -d (CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS) and the
+  size of the POST was zero length, it made libcurl first send a zero
+  chunk and then the terminating one. This could confuse a receiver and it
+  should rather just send the terminating chunk as it does with this fix.

-- curl.1: updated --libcurl
+Yang Tse (19 Apr 2012)
+- Take in account that CURLAUTH_* bitmasks are now 'unsigned long' - follow-up
   
-  With Colin Hogben's recent work, --libcurl now also works with -F and
-  more. Remove the previous caveat.
+  MIPSPro compiler detected curl_easy_getinfo() related missing adjustments.
+  SunPro compiler detected curl tool --libcurl option related missing adjustments.
 
-- test: --libcurl fixes
+- url.c: CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH and CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH fixes
   
-  The line endings broke when I saved the three recent patches (my fault,
-  not Colin's) to 'git am' them.
+  Fail with CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN when none of requested auth methods is supported.
   
-  Adjusted the stripping of the test program for comparing to also exclude
-  the SSH key file name as that will differ and use a local path name.
-
-- [Colin Hogben brought this change]
+  Reject CURLAUTH_ONLY bit when given alone or with CURLAUTH_NONE.
 
-  Add helper script convsrctest.pl to manipulate --libcurl tests.
+- Take in account that CURLAUTH_* bitmasks are now 'unsigned long'
   
-  The intention is to take the output of curl's --libcurl option,
-  as exercised in test 14xx, and generate a corresponding test15xx
-  in which the generated code is compiled and run.  This will verify
-  that the generated code behaves equivalently to the original
-  invocation of the curl command.
-  
-  The script is not yet integrated into the configure / makefile
-  machinery.
+  Data type of internal vars holding CURLAUTH_* bitmasks changed from 'long' to
+  'unsigned long' for proper handling and operating.
 
-- [Colin Hogben brought this change]
+- curl.h: CURLAUTH_* bitmasks adjusted to become 'unsigned long' typed
+  
+  Info: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-04/0170.html
 
-  Add tests for curl's --libcurl output.
+- Some explicit conversion to 'long' of curl_easy_setopt() third argument
   
-  These tests check the output of the --libcurl option of curl,
-  including the improved option handling added in a related patch.
+  Explicit conversion to 'long' of curl_easy_setopt() third argument for options

+  docummented to be used.

+- build adjustments: commit 9e24b9c7 follow-up
 
-  Generate lists and use symbols in --libcurl code output.
+Daniel Stenberg (17 Apr 2012)
+- -# progress meter: avoid superfluous updates and duplicate lines
   
-  This patch improves the output of curl's --libcurl option by
-  generating code which builds curl_httppost and curl_slist lists, and
-  uses symbolic names for enum and flag values.  Variants of the
-  my_setopt macro in tool_setopt.h are added in order to pass extra type
-  information to the code-generation step in tool_setopt.c.
+  By comparing if a different "progress point" is reached or not since the
+  previous update, the progress function callback for this now avoids many
+  superfluous screen updates. This has the nice side-effect that it fixes
+  a problem that causes a second progress meter line.
   
-  If curl is configured with --disable-libcurl-option then the macros

-  When CURLOPT_REFERER has been used, curl_easy_reset() did not properly

+  I don't think there is a bug in current implementation of hostname

+  described in the comment in ssluse.c).
   
-  Verified with the new test 598
+  Firefox implementation is also based on RFC 2818 but it only allows at
+  most one wildcard character and it must be in the left-most label in the
+  pattern and the wildcard must not be followed by any character in the
+  label.[2] Chromium implementation is based on RFC 6125 as my patch does.
+  Firefox and Chromium both require wildcard in the left-most label in the

-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-01/0225.html
-  Reported by: Christian Grothoff
+- pop.c: Small code tidy up
 
-- tests: test CRLF in URLs
-  
-  Related to the security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036
+- pop3: Removed the need for the single message LIST command handler
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html
+  Simplified the code to remove the need for a separate "LIST <msg id>"
+  command handler and state machine and instead use the LIST command
+  handler for both operations.
 
-- URL sanitize: reject URLs containing bad data
-  
-  Protocols (IMAP, POP3 and SMTP) that use the path part of a URL in a
-  decoded manner now use the new Curl_urldecode() function to reject URLs
-  with embedded control codes (anything that is or decodes to a byte value
-  less than 32).
-  
-  URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and
-  allow users to do unintended actions with otherwise innocent tools and
-  applications. Like for example using a URL like
-  pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get
-  a mail and instead this would delete one.
-  
-  This flaw is considered a security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036

+- pop3.c: Code policing and tidy up
   
-  Reported by: Dan Fandrich
+  Corrected character and line spacing and re-ordered list and retr

-- OpenSSL: don't disable security work-around
-  
-  OpenSSL added a work-around for a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability
-  (http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt). In 0.9.6e they added a bit
-  to SSL_OP_ALL that _disables_ that work-around despite the fact that
-  SSL_OP_ALL is documented to do "rather harmless" workarounds.
+- email: Moved server greeting responses into separate functions
   
-  The libcurl code uses the SSL_OP_ALL define and thus logically always
-  disables the OpenSSL fix.
-  
-  In order to keep the secure work-around workding, the
-  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit must not be set and this change
-  makes sure of this.
+  Moved the server greeting response handling code from the statemach_act
+  functions to separate response functions. This makes the code simpler
+  to follow and provides consistency with the other responses that are
+  handled here.
+
+- pop3.c: Fixed body data being written when CURLOPT_NOBODY is specified
   
-  Reported by: product-security at Apple
+  Body data would be forwarded to the client application in both the RETR
+  and LIST commands even if CURLOPT_NOBODY was specified.

+- [Steve Holme brought this change]
+
+  smtp_mail: Added support to MAIL FROM for the optional AUTH parameter
   
-  When a HTTP connection is re-used for a subsequent request without
-  proxy, it would always re-use the Host: header of the first request. As
-  host names are case insensitive it would make curl send another host
-  name case that what the particular request used.
+  Added a new CURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH option that allows the calling program to
+  set the optional AUTH parameter in the MAIL FROM command.
   
-  Now it will instead always use the most recent host name to always use
-  the desired casing.
+  When this option is specified and an authentication mechanism is used
+  to communicate with the mail server then the AUTH parameter will be
+  included in the MAIL FROM command. This is particularly useful when the
+  calling program is acting as a relay in a trusted environment and
+  performing server to server communication, as it allows the relaying
+  server to specify the address of the mailbox that was used to
+  authenticate and send the original email.

-  CURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS
+  URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and

+  pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get

+- ftp_do_more: don't return success until all is done
   
-  New gnutls versions have an error handler that knows about Winsock
-  errors, which is why gnutls_transport_set_global_errno() was deprecated
-  and then removed.
+  ftp_do_more() returns after accepting the server connect however it
+  needs to fall through and set "*complete" to TRUE before exit from the
+  function.
   
-  This is a correction of commit f5bb370 (blame me) which meant to
-  reimplement gnutls_transport_set_global_errno(), which is not necessary.

-  A regression between 7.22.0 and 7.23.0 -- downloading a file with the

-  only if there was no Content-Disposition header in the http response. If
-  there is a C-D header with a filename attribute, the output is correctly

-  When the user requests PORT with a specific port or port range, the code
-  could lock up in an endless loop. There's now an extra conditional that
-  makes sure to special treat the error and try the local address only
-  once so a second failure will abort the loop correctly.

-  libcurl properly _not_ deals with Negotiate if not asked to even if the

-  HTTP auth: fix proxy Negotiate bug
-  
-  If a proxy offers several Authentication schemes where NTLM and
-  Negotiate are offered by the proxy and you tell libcurl not to use the
-  Negotiate scheme then the request never returns when the proxy answers
-  with its HTTP 407 reply.
+  curl.h: add __ANDROID__ macro check
   
-  It is reproducible by the following steps:
+  When working with the Android Standalone Toolchain the compiler defines
+  this macro:
   
-  - Use a proxy that offers NTLM and Negotiate ( CURLOPT_PROXY and
-  CURLOPT_PROXYPORT )
+    /path/to/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc -E -dM - < /dev/null \
+    | grep -i android
+    #define __ANDROID__ 1
   
-  - Tell libcurl NOT to use Negotiate CURL_EASY_SETOPT(CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH,
-  CURLAUTH_BASIC | CURLAUTH_DIGEST | CURLAUTH_NTLM )
+  We really need to check both ANDROID and __ANDROID__ since I've observed
+  that:
   
-  - Start the request
+  * if you use Android.mk file(s) and the 'ndk-build' script (aka vanilla
+  way), ANDROID is predefined (see -DANDROID extra C flag),
   
-  The call to CURL_EASY_PERFORM never returns. If you switch on debug
-  logging you can see that libcurl issues a new request As soon as it
-  received the 407 reply. Instead it should return and set the response
-  code to 407.
+  * if you use the Android Standalone Toolchain, then __ANDROID__ is
+  predefined as stated by the compiler

+- lib500: verify timers relative each other
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-10/0323.html
+  As commit ce896875f8 fixed a timer that accidentally had been moved in
+  code and then returned a bad timer, the lib500.c code (used in test 500
+  and some others) now verifies 5 timers against each other to verify that
+  they have the correct relative values. We cannot compare against
+  absolute values as the timings will vary a lot.

-- ssluse.c: fix calling of OpenSSL's ERR_remove_state(0)
+- Curl_pgrsTime: store now in an auto variable
   
-  Move calling of ERR_remove_state(0) a.k.a ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL)
-  from Curl_ossl_close_all() to Curl_ossl_cleanup().
+  It makes it easier to introduce debug outputs in this function, and
+  everything in the function is using the value anyway so it might even be
+  more efficient.
+
+- timer: restore PRETRANSFER timing
   
-  In this way ERR_remove_state(0) is now only called in libcurl by
-  curl_global_cleanup(). Previously it would get called by functions
-  curl_easy_cleanup(), curl_multi_cleanup and potentially each time a
-  connection was removed from a connection cache leading to premature
-  destruction of OpenSSL's thread local state hash.
+  Regression introduced in 7.23.0 with commit 9dd85bce. The function in
+  which the PRETRANSFER time stamp was recorded was moved in time causing
+  it be stored very quickly after the start timestamp. On most systems
+  shorter than 1 millisecond and thus it wouldn't even show with -w
+  "%{time_pretransfer}" using the command line tool.
   
-  Multi-threaded apps using OpenSSL enabled libcurl should still call
-  function ERR_remove_state(0) or ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL) at the
-  very end end of threads that do not call curl_global_cleanup().

-  When running torture tests, verify before each test case that required

-  If found not responsive then restart them.
+  Do not try to resolve interfaces names via DNS by recognizing interface
+  names in a few ways.  If the interface option argument has a prefix of

+  interface argument is the name of an interface (even if it does not have

+  interface argument is prefixed by "host!" treat it as a hostname that
+  must be resolved by /etc/hosts or DNS.

-- curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
+Daniel Stenberg (6 Dec 2011)
+- MakefileBuild: fix the static build
   
-  After a PORT has been issued, and the multi handle would switch to the
-  CURLM_STATE_DO_MORE state (which is unique for FTP), libcurl would
-  return the wrong fdset to wait for when curl_multi_fdset() is
-  called. The code would blindly assume that it was waiting for a connect
-  of the second connection, while that isn't true immediately after the
-  PORT command.
+  This is a left-over fix from commit b7e242de0e that Tom Wright
+  suggested.
   
-  Also, the function multi.c:domore_getsock() was highly FTP-centric and
-  therefore ugly to keep in protocol-agnostic code. I solved this problem
-  by introducing a new function pointer in the Curl_handler struct called
-  domore_getsock() which is only called during the DOMORE state for
-  protocols that set that pointer.
+  Reported by: Ward Willats
+
+- OpenSSL: check for the SSLv2 function in configure
   
-  The new ftp.c:ftp_domore_getsock() function now returns fdset info about
-  the control connection's command/response handling while such a state is
-  in use, and goes over to waiting for a writable second connection first
-  once the commands are done.
+  If no SSLv2 was detected in OpenSSL by configure, then we enforce the
+  OPENSSL_NO_SSL2 define as it seems some people report it not being
+  defined properly in the OpenSSL headers.
+
+- CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT: default is 300 seconds
   
-  The original problem could be seen by running test 525 and checking the
-  time stamps in the FTP server log. I can verify that this fix at least
-  fixes this problem.
+  If the option is set to 0, the default timeout will be used - which in
+  modern libcurl versions equals 300 seconds (== 5 minutes).

-  smtp: General tidy up ready for adding NTLM support
+- -J -O: use -O name if no Content-Disposition header comes!
   
-  Changed the name of variable l, in several functions, which represents
-  the length of strings being sent to the server, to len which is more
-  meaningful and consistent with other code in smtp.c and elsewhere.
+  A regression between 7.22.0 and 7.23.0 -- downloading a file with the
+  flags -O and -J results in the content being written to stdout if and
+  only if there was no Content-Disposition header in the http response. If
+  there is a C-D header with a filename attribute, the output is correctly
+  written.
   
-  Reworked smtp_authenticate() to be simpler and easier to follow.
-  Variables and now initialised in their definitions and if no username
-  and password are specified the function sets the state to SMTP_STOP and
-  returns immediately, rather than being part of a huge if statement.

-- POST: always set postfieldsize
+Yang Tse (4 Nov 2011)
+- ssluse.c: fix calling of OpenSSL's ERR_remove_state(0)
   
-  When we use binary posts and regular ones intermixed on a single command
-  line, we cannot do strlen() etc on the data to figure out the length
-  (when inserting '&' and more). We must therefore keep track of the post
-  data length. Then we also end up setting the libcurl option with the
-  known size, so that we don't risk that libcurl will do strlen() on the
-  data.
+  Move calling of ERR_remove_state(0) a.k.a ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL)
+  from Curl_ossl_close_all() to Curl_ossl_cleanup().
   
-  This has the minor side-effect that --libcurl source codes now always
-  will use CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE but I don't consider that terribly
-  damaging.
+  In this way ERR_remove_state(0) is now only called in libcurl by
+  curl_global_cleanup(). Previously it would get called by functions
+  curl_easy_cleanup(), curl_multi_cleanup and potentially each time a
+  connection was removed from a connection cache leading to premature
+  destruction of OpenSSL's thread local state hash.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3413181
-  Reported by: Taneli Vhkangas
+  Multi-threaded apps using OpenSSL enabled libcurl should still call
+  function ERR_remove_state(0) or ERR_remove_thread_state(NULL) at the
+  very end end of threads that do not call curl_global_cleanup().

+- ftpserver.pl: ensure integral number usage for passive mode string
 
-- curl tool: move 'Configurable' and free_config_fields() to tool_cfgable.[ch]
+Daniel Stenberg (24 Oct 2011)
+- large headers: have curl accept >16K headers
   
-  Reviewing fields being free'd in free_config_fields() still pending
-
-- src/setup.h: add conditional include of assert.h
+  As commit 5850cc4808ab clarifies, libcurl can deliver header lines that
+  are longer than CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE, only body data is limited to that
+  size. The curl tool has check (when built debug-enabled) that made the
+  wrong checks and this new test 1205 verifies that larger headers work.
 
-- curl tool: move so called 'multi_files' stuff into tool_mfiles.[ch]
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: headers can be CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER bytes
   
-  Additionally some code reorganization and direct OOM handling fixes,

-- curl tool: fix a bunch of double free's uncovered 2011-09-15
+- curl_easy_setopt.3: fix typo
   
-  Re-enabling MemoryTracking capability on 'src' subdirectory files and torture
-  tests have uncovered many issues which were going unnoticed in curl tool. So
-  here we go fixing some of them. Others still remain and should be addressed
-  ASAP, given that curl tool is used in our test harness also for test server
-  start verification purposes. There are even non-socket file descriptor leaks.

-- curl tool: re-enable MemoryTracking capability on 'src' subdirectory files.
+Yang Tse (22 Oct 2011)
+- tool_operate.c: OOM handling fix
   
-  Use same preprocessor logic for curl tool MemoryTracking activation in source
-  files located in 'src' subdirectory as the one used for libcurl sources.
+  Move curl_easy_perform source code geneartion out of curl_easy_perform's loop
+  for proper OOM handling and source code geneartion.
 
-- ftp.c: add a couple of failure messages
+Daniel Stenberg (21 Oct 2011)
+- curl_multi_fdset: correct fdset with FTP PORT use
+  
+  After a PORT has been issued, and the multi handle would switch to the
+  CURLM_STATE_DO_MORE state (which is unique for FTP), libcurl would
+  return the wrong fdset to wait for when curl_multi_fdset() is
+  called. The code would blindly assume that it was waiting for a connect
+  of the second connection, while that isn't true immediately after the
+  PORT command.
+  
+  Also, the function multi.c:domore_getsock() was highly FTP-centric and
+  therefore ugly to keep in protocol-agnostic code. I solved this problem
+  by introducing a new function pointer in the Curl_handler struct called
+  domore_getsock() which is only called during the DOMORE state for
+  protocols that set that pointer.
+  
+  The new ftp.c:ftp_domore_getsock() function now returns fdset info about
+  the control connection's command/response handling while such a state is
+  in use, and goes over to waiting for a writable second connection first
+  once the commands are done.
+  
+  The original problem could be seen by running test 525 and checking the
+  time stamps in the FTP server log. I can verify that this fix at least
+  fixes this problem.

-- NTLM: header inclusion cleanup follow-up
-
-- NTLM: header inclusion cleanup
-
-- NTLM: END of refactoring/splitting/moving
+  Modified smtp_endofresp() to detect NTLM from the server specified list
+  of supported authentication mechanisms.
   
-  First:
+  Modified smtp_authenticate() to start the sending of the NTLM data.
   
-  File curl_ntlm.h renamed curl_ntlm_msgs.h
-  File curl_ntlm.c renamed curl_ntlm_msgs.c
+  Added smtp_auth_ntlm_type1_message() which creates a NTLM type-1
+  message. This function is used by authenticate() to start the sending
+  of data and by smtp_state_auth_ntlm_resp() when the AUTH command
+  doesn't contain the type-1 message as part of the initial response.
+  This lack of initial response can happen if an OOM error occurs or the
+  type-1 message is longer than 504 characters. As the main AUTH command
+  is limited to 512 character the data has to be transmitted in two
+  parts; one containing the AUTH NTLM and the second containing the
+  type-1 message.
   
-  Afterwards:
+  Added smtp_state_auth_ntlm_type2msg_resp() which handles the incoming
+  type-2 message and sends an outgoing type-3 message. This type-2
+  message is sent by the server in response to our type-1 message.
   
-  File http_ntlm.c renamed curl_ntlm.c
-  File http_ntlm.h renamed curl_ntlm.h
-
-- NTLM: move NTLM core specifics into curl_ntlm_core.[ch]

+  Added the output message length as a parameter to both
+  Curl_ntlm_create_type1_message() and Curl_ntlm_create_type3_message()
+  for use by future functions that require it.
   
-  Preprocessor symbol WINBIND_NTLM_AUTH_ENABLED renamed to NTLM_WB_ENABLED
-  Preprocessor symbol WINBIND_NTLM_AUTH_FILE renamed to NTLM_WB_FILE
+  Updated curl_ntlm.c to cater for the extra parameter on these two
+  functions.
+
+- [Steve Holme brought this change]
+
+  smtp: General tidy up ready for adding NTLM support
   
-  Test harness env var CURL_NTLM_AUTH renamed to CURL_NTLM_WB_FILE
+  Changed the name of variable l, in several functions, which represents
+  the length of strings being sent to the server, to len which is more
+  meaningful and consistent with other code in smtp.c and elsewhere.
   
-  Static function wb_ntlm_close renamed to ntlm_wb_cleanup
-  Static function wb_ntlm_initiate renamed to ntlm_wb_init
-  Static function wb_ntlm_response renamed to ntlm_wb_response
+  Reworked smtp_authenticate() to be simpler and easier to follow.
+  Variables and now initialised in their definitions and if no username
+  and password are specified the function sets the state to SMTP_STOP and
+  returns immediately, rather than being part of a huge if statement.

+  smtp_mail: Added support to MAIL FROM for the optional SIZE parameter
   
-  AUTH PLAIN should be the last as it slightly more insecure than AUTH LOGIN

-  
-  When using the multi interface, a SOCKS proxy, and a connection that

-  
-  This problem is a regression that was introduced by commit

-- MemoryTracking: adjust curl_domalloc() and curl_dofree() memory filling
-  
-  Until 2011-08-17 libcurl's Memory Tracking feature also performed
-  automatic malloc and free filling operations using 0xA5 and 0x13
-  values. Our own preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory
-  might be useful when not using third party memory debuggers, but
-  on the other hand this would fool memory debuggers into thinking
-  that all dynamically allocated memory is properly initialized.
-  
-  As a default setting, libcurl's Memory Tracking feature no longer
-  performs preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory on its
-  own. If you know what you are doing, and really want to retain old
-  behavior, you can achieve this compiling with preprocessor symbols
-  CURL_MT_MALLOC_FILL and CURL_MT_FREE_FILL defined with appropriate

+- [Steve Holme brought this change]

-- cookie parser: handle 'secure='
-  
-  There are two keywords in cookie headers that don't follow the regular

-  are written like 'secure=' and then treat them as if they were written
-  'secure'. Test case 31 was much extended by Rob Ward to test this.

-Yang Tse (4 Aug 2011)
-- BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack support:
-  
-  Allow compilation of libcurl and curl using BSD-style lwIP on Win32.
-  
-  In order to compile libcurl and curl with this support it is necessary
-  to edit files lib/config-win32.h and src/config-win32.h and uncomment
-  a line to make definition of preprocessor symbol USE_LWIPSOCK visible.
+- Changed MinGW to use own winidn prototypes.
+
+Dan Fandrich (2 Sep 2011)
+- Fix NTLM winbind support to pass the torture tests
   
-  Afterwards you can compile as usual.
+  Calling sclose() both in the child and the parent fools the
+  socket leak detector into thinking it's been closed twice.
+  Calling close() in the child instead overcomes this problem. It's
+  not as portable as the sclose() macro, but this code is highly
+  POSIX-specific, anyway.
+
+Yang Tse (2 Sep 2011)
+- MemoryTracking: fix logging of free() calls done where Curl_safefree is called
   
-  In order to use compiled library with BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack in
-  your program it is mandatory that you include lwIP header file <lwip/opt.h>
-  before including <curl/curl.h> or <curl/multi.h>
+  Just internal stuff...
   
-  Compilation has been verified with lwIP 1.4.0 and contrib-1.4.0 from:
+  Curl_safefree is now a macro defined in memdebug.h instead of a function
+  prototyped in url.h and implemented in url.c, so inclusion of url.h is no
+  longer required in order to simply use Curl_safefree.
   
-  http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lwip/lwip-1.4.0.zip
-  http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lwip/contrib-1.4.0.zip
+  Provide definition of macro WHILE_FALSE in setup_once.h in order to allow
+  other macros such as DEBUGF and DEBUGASSERT, and code using it, to compile
+  without 'conditional expression is constant' warnings.
   
-  Have fun!
+  The WHILE_FALSE stuff fixes 150+ MSVC compiler warnings.

+  Fixed the order of the preferred SMTP authentication method to:

+  
+  AUTH PLAIN should be the last as it slightly more insecure than AUTH LOGIN

-  progress: reset flags at transfer start
+  http NTLM: remaining bits from 0001-Moved-ntlm-[...]-curl_ntlm-mod_3.patch
   
-  When an easy handle is used to download an URI which has no
-  Content-Length header (or equivalent) after downloading an URI which
-  does, the value from the previous transfer is reused and returned by
-  CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD. This is because the progress flags
-  (used to determine whether such a header was received) are not reset
-  between transfers.

+- zlib: ensure user provided memory functions are used by zlib, when given
   
-  When libcurl has said to the server that there's a POST or PUT coming

-  data or it needs to close the connection before trying a second request.
+  As a bonus, this lets our MemoryTracking subsystem track zlib operations.

-  The bug report is about when used with 100-continue, but the change is

+  When using the multi interface, a SOCKS proxy, and a connection that
+  wouldn't immediately consider itself connected (which my Linux tests do
+  by default), libcurl would be tricked into doing _two_ connects to the
+  SOCKS proxy when it setup the data connection and then of course the
+  second attempt would fail miserably and cause error.
+  
+  This problem is a regression that was introduced by commit
+  4a42e5cdaa344755 that was introduced in the 7.21.7 release.

+- MemoryTracking: adjust curl_domalloc() and curl_dofree() memory filling
+  
+  Until 2011-08-17 libcurl's Memory Tracking feature also performed
+  automatic malloc and free filling operations using 0xA5 and 0x13
+  values. Our own preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory
+  might be useful when not using third party memory debuggers, but
+  on the other hand this would fool memory debuggers into thinking
+  that all dynamically allocated memory is properly initialized.
+  
+  As a default setting, libcurl's Memory Tracking feature no longer
+  performs preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory on its
+  own. If you know what you are doing, and really want to retain old
+  behavior, you can achieve this compiling with preprocessor symbols
+  CURL_MT_MALLOC_FILL and CURL_MT_FREE_FILL defined with appropriate
+  values.

-- configure: warn if OpenSSL headers and library versions don't match
+  There are two keywords in cookie headers that don't follow the regular

+  'secure'. Test case 31 was much extended by Rob Ward to test this.

-  Also, convert the BANPROXY flag into NONETWORK for the protocols
-  (file:// only atm) that don't work over networks.
+  Modern gcc versions (4.6.X) get more picky by default and have started

-- curl.1: --socks* options no longer needed
+Julien Chaffraix (12 Jul 2011)
+- gssapi.c: Simplified the function.
   
-  As we now can specify all the socks proxy types with the regular --proxy
-  option using protocol prefix.
+  Removed the parameters that were common to all our invocation.
 
-- socks proxy: allow socks5h:// prefix too
+- Added Curl_gss_init_sec_context.
   
-  Using 'socks5h' as proxy protocol will make it a
-  CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME proxy which is SOCKS5 and asking the proxy to
-  resolve host names. I found no "standard" protocol name for this.
+  This function wraps our calls to gss_init_sec_context so that we
+  have a unified way to talk to GSSAPI.

+  Autobuild submitters can use this to add some text to their

-  curl-config --version didn't output the correct version string (bug
-  introduced in commit 0355e33b5f7b234cf3), and unfortunately the test
-  case 1022 that was supposed to check for this was broken.
-  
-  This change fixes the test to detect this problem and it fixes the
-  output.

+- create_conn: only switch protocol handler if necessary

+  When switching to HTTP because a HTTP proxy is being used, the existing

-  
-  * Removed the preprocessing step; no need for PP_CMD and the .int files.
-   curl.exe builds fine w/o and the makefile gets simpler.
-  
-  * Added a target for creating a compressed hugehelp.c if WITH_ZLIB is  defined.
-  It assumes groff, gzip and perl is available if such an "advanced"  users
-  requests it. Okay? BTW. My groff and Perl needs unix-slashes ('/').

+  be completely wrong or somewhat accurate. 300 million!
 
-  curl packages are downloaded from the curl.haxx.se and mirrors over a

-  distributions. curl is installed by default with Mac OS X. curl and libcurl
-  as used by numerous applications that include libcurl binaries in their
-  distribution packages (like Adobe Acrobat Reader and Google Earth).
-
-  More than a hundred known named companies use curl in commercial
-  environments and products and more than a hundred known named open source
-  projects depend on (lib)curl.
-
-  In a poll on the curl web site mid-2005, more than 50% of the 300+ answers
-  estimated a user base of one million users or more.
-
-  In March 2005, the "Linux Counter project" estimated a total Linux user base
-  of some 29 millions, while Netcraft detected some 4 million "active" Linux
-  based web servers. A guess is that a fair amount of these Linux
-  installations have curl installed.

-  The Debian project maintains statistics on packages installed by people
-  who have voluntarily run their package counting application.  In mid-2010,
-  libcurl3 was installed on over 55000 such systems (62% of reporting systems)
-  and was one of the 320 most popular installed packages (out of about 107000
-  possible packages).

-  All this taken together, there is no doubt that there are millions of

+<p class="level1">Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It can be used to specify the request instead of GET or HEAD when performing HTTP based requests, instead of LIST and NLST when performing FTP directory listings and instead of LIST and RETR when issuing POP3 based commands. This is particularly useful, for example, for performing a HTTP DELETE request or a POP3 DELE command.

 <p class="level1">When you change the request method by setting <a class="bold" href="#CURLOPTCUSTOMREQUEST">CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST</a> to something, you don't actually change how libcurl behaves or acts in regards to the particular request method, it will only change the actual string sent in the request. 
 <p class="level1">For example: if you tell libcurl to do a HEAD request, but then change the request to a "GET" with <a class="bold" href="#CURLOPTCUSTOMREQUEST">CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST</a> you'll still see libcurl act as if it sent a HEAD even when it does send a GET.

 <p class="level1">Many people have wrongly used this option to replace the entire request with their own, including multiple headers and POST contents.

+
+  Also, this information is included in the headers of every mail that is sent
+  out to all curl related mailing lists and there's footer in each mail that
+  links to the "admin" page on which you can unsubscribe and change other
+  options.
+
+  You NEVER EVER email the mailing list requesting someone else to get you off

  curl_easy_perform() (or similar) called - which is hard to grasp and a design
  mistake.
