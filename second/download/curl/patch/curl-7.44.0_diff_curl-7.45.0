-  curl_formget.3: correct return code
+Jay Satiro (4 Oct 2015)
+- getinfo: Fix return code for unknown CURLINFO options
   
-  Closes #375
+  - If a CURLINFO option is unknown return CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION.
+  
+  Prior to this change CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT was returned on
+  unknown. That return value is contradicted by the CURLINFO option
+  documentation which specifies a return of CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION on
+  unknown.

-  http2: discard frames with no SessionHandle
-  
-  Return 0 instead of NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE if we can't locate the
-  SessionHandle. Apparently mod_h2 will sometimes send a frame for a
-  stream_id we're finished with.
+  gopher: don't send NUL byte
   
-  Use nghttp2_session_get_stream_user_data and

-  of a hash.
+  Closes #466

-- scripts: Always perform setlocal and endlocal calls in pairs
+  gnutls: Support CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD
   
-  Ensure that there isn't a mismatch between setlocal and endlocal calls,
-  which could have happened due to setlocal being called after certain
-  error conditions were checked for.
+  The gnutls vtls back-end was previously ignoring any password set via
+  CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD. Presumably this was because
+  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file did not support encrypted keys.
+  
+  gnutls now has a gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2 function that
+  does support encrypted keys. Let's determine at compile time whether the
+  available gnutls supports this new function. If it does then use it to
+  pass the password. If it does not then emit a helpful diagnostic if a
+  password is set. This is preferable to the previous behaviour of just
+  failing to read the certificate without giving a reason in that case.
+  
+  Signed-off-by: Mike Crowe <mac@mcrowe.com>
 
-- scripts: Allow -help to be specified in any argument
+- CURLINFO_TLS_SESSION: always return backend info
   
-  Allow the -help command line argument to be specified in any argument
-  and not just as the first.
+  ... even for those that don't support providing anything in the
+  'internals' struct member since it offers a convenient way for
+  applications to figure this out.

-  NTLM: handle auth for only a single request
-  
-  Currently when the server responds with 401 on NTLM authenticated
-  connection (re-used) we consider it to have failed.  However this is
-  legitimate and may happen when for example IIS is set configured to
-  'authPersistSingleRequest' or when the request goes thru a proxy (with
-  'via' header).
+- tests: disable 1801 until fixed
   
-  Implemented by imploying an additional state once a connection is
-  re-used to indicate that if we receive 401 we need to restart
-  authentication.
+  It is unreliable and causes CI problems on github
   
-  Closes #363

-- SSH: three state machine fixups
+Kamil Dudka (18 Sep 2015)
+- nss: prevent NSS from incorrectly re-using a session
   
-  The SSH state machine didn't clear the 'rc' variable appropriately in a
-  two places which prevented it from looping the way it should. And it
-  lacked an 'else' statement that made it possible to erroneously get
-  stuck in the SSH_AUTH_AGENT state.
+  Without this workaround, NSS re-uses a session cache entry despite the
+  server name does not match.  This causes SNI host name to differ from
+  the actual host name.  Consequently, certain servers (e.g. github.com)
+  respond by 400 to such requests.

-- http: move HTTP/2 cleanup code off http_disconnect()
+- parse_proxy: reject illegal port numbers
   
-  Otherwise it would never be called for an HTTP/2 connection, which has
-  its own disconnect handler.
+  If the port number in the proxy string ended weirdly or the number is
+  too large, skip it. Mostly as a means to bail out early if a "bare" IPv6
+  numerical address is used without enclosing brackets.
   
-  I spotted this while debugging <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1248389>
-  where the http_disconnect() handler was called on an FTP session handle
-  causing 'dnf' to crash.  conn->data->req.protop of type (struct FTP *)
-  was reinterpreted as type (struct HTTP *) which resulted in SIGSEGV in
-  Curl_add_buffer_free() after printing the "Connection cache is full,
-  closing the oldest one." message.
+  Also mention the bracket requirement for IPv6 numerical addresses to the
+  man page for CURLOPT_PROXY.
   
-  A previously working version of libcurl started to crash after it was
-  recompiled with the HTTP/2 support despite the HTTP/2 protocol was not
-  actually used.  This commit makes it work again although I suspect the
-  root cause (reinterpreting session handle data of incompatible protocol)
-  still has to be fixed.  Otherwise the same will happen when mixing FTP
-  and HTTP/2 connections and exceeding the connection cache limit.

-  before returning an error.

-  Fix this.
+  - Add new tool option --proto-default to expose

-  Although actually, it never happens in practice because we never *get*
-  here with state == NTLMSTATE_TYPE1. The state is always zero. That
-  might want cleaning up in a separate patch.
+  In the case of schemeless URLs libcurl will behave in this way:
   
-  Reported-by: Terri Oda
+  When the option is used libcurl will use the supplied default.

+  When the option is not used, libcurl will follow its usual plan of

-- cookie: Fix bug in export if any-domain cookie is present

-  In 3013bb6 I had changed cookie export to ignore any-domain cookies,
-  however the logic I used to do so was incorrect, and would lead to a
-  busy loop in the case of exporting a cookie list that contained
-  any-domain cookies. The result of that is worse though, because in that
-  case the other cookies would not be written resulting in an empty file
-  once the application is terminated to stop the busy loop.

-- schannel: schannel_recv overhaul
-  
-  This commit is several drafts squashed together. The changes from each
-  draft are noted below. If any changes are similar and possibly
-  contradictory the change in the latest draft takes precedence.
-  
-  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/issues/244
-  Reported-by: Chris Araman
-  
-  %%
-  %% Draft 1
-  %%
-  - return 0 if len == 0. that will have to be documented.
-  - continue on and process the caches regardless of raw recv
-  - if decrypted data will be returned then set the error code to CURLE_OK
-  and return its count
-  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection has closed
-  (eg nread == 0) then return 0 and CURLE_OK
-  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection *hasn't*
-  closed then set the error code to CURLE_AGAIN --only if an error code
-  isn't already set-- and return -1
-  - narrow the Win2k workaround to only Win2k
-  
-  %%
-  %% Draft 2
-  %%
-  - Trying out a change in flow to handle corner cases.
-  
-  %%
-  %% Draft 3
-  %%
-  - Back out the lazier decryption change made in draft2.
-  
-  %%
-  %% Draft 4
-  %%
-  - Some formatting and branching changes
-  - Decrypt all encrypted cached data when len == 0
-  - Save connection closed state
-  - Change special Win2k check to use connection closed state
-  
-  %%
-  %% Draft 5
-  %%
-  - Default to CURLE_AGAIN in cleanup if an error code wasn't set and the
-  connection isn't closed.
-  
-  %%
-  %% Draft 6
-  %%
-  - Save the last error only if it is an unrecoverable error.
-  
-  Prior to this I saved the last error state in all cases; unfortunately
-  the logic to cover that in all cases would lead to some muddle and I'm
-  concerned that could then lead to a bug in the future so I've replaced
-  it by only recording an unrecoverable error and that state will persist.
-  
-  - Do not recurse on renegotiation.
-  
-  Instead we'll continue on to process any trailing encrypted data
-  received during the renegotiation only.
-  
-  - Move the err checks in cleanup after the check for decrypted data.
-  
-  In either case decrypted data is always returned but I think it's easier
-  to understand when those err checks come after the decrypted data check.
-  
-  %%
-  %% Draft 7
-  %%
-  - Regardless of len value go directly to cleanup if there is an
-  unrecoverable error or a close_notify was already received. Prior to
-  this change we only acknowledged those two states if len != 0.
-  
-  - Fix a bug in connection closed behavior: Set the error state in the
-  cleanup, because we don't know for sure it's an error until that time.
-  
-  - (Related to above) In the case the connection is closed go "greedy"
-  with the decryption to make sure all remaining encrypted data has been
-  decrypted even if it is not needed at that time by the caller. This is
-  necessary because we can only tell if the connection closed gracefully
-  (close_notify) once all encrypted data has been decrypted.
-  
-  - Do not renegotiate when an unrecoverable error is pending.
-  
-  %%
-  %% Draft 8
-  %%
-  - Don't show 'server closed the connection' info message twice.
-  
-  - Show an info message if server closed abruptly (missing close_notify).

-  certificate, libcurl will now continue the handshake without one,
-  rather than terminating the handshake. The server can then decide
-  if that is acceptable or not. Prior to this change, libcurl would
-  terminate the handshake, reporting a SEC_I_INCOMPLETE_CREDENTIALS

+  The SSH state machine didn't clear the 'rc' variable appropriately in a

-- openssl: Fix verification of server-sent legacy intermediates
+Kamil Dudka (30 Jul 2015)
+- http: move HTTP/2 cleanup code off http_disconnect()
   
-  - Try building a chain using issuers in the trusted store first to avoid
-  problems with server-sent legacy intermediates.
+  Otherwise it would never be called for an HTTP/2 connection, which has
+  its own disconnect handler.
   
-  Prior to this change server-sent legacy intermediates with missing
-  legacy issuers would cause verification to fail even if the client's CA
-  bundle contained a valid replacement for the intermediate and an
-  alternate chain could be constructed that would verify successfully.
+  I spotted this while debugging <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1248389>
+  where the http_disconnect() handler was called on an FTP session handle
+  causing 'dnf' to crash.  conn->data->req.protop of type (struct FTP *)
+  was reinterpreted as type (struct HTTP *) which resulted in SIGSEGV in
+  Curl_add_buffer_free() after printing the "Connection cache is full,
+  closing the oldest one." message.

-- BINDINGS: update several URLs
+  A previously working version of libcurl started to crash after it was
+  recompiled with the HTTP/2 support despite the HTTP/2 protocol was not

+  root cause (reinterpreting session handle data of incompatible protocol)
+  still has to be fixed.  Otherwise the same will happen when mixing FTP
+  and HTTP/2 connections and exceeding the connection cache limit.

-  
-  - Change fopen calls to use FOPEN_READTEXT instead of "r" or "rt"
-  - Change fopen calls to use FOPEN_WRITETEXT instead of "w" or "wt"
-  
-  This change is to explicitly specify when we need to read/write text.
-  Unfortunately 't' is not part of POSIX fopen so we can't specify it
-  directly. Instead we now have FOPEN_READTEXT, FOPEN_WRITETEXT.
+- build: Use $(ProjectName) macro for curl.exe and curld.exe filenames
   
-  Prior to this change we had an issue on Windows if an application that
-  uses libcurl overrides the default file mode to binary. The default file
-  mode in Windows is normally text mode (translation mode) and that's what
-  libcurl expects.
+  This wasn't possible with the old curlsrc project filenames, but like

-  http2: Faster http2 upload
-  
-  Previously, when we send all given buffer in data_source_callback, we
-  return NGHTTP2_ERR_DEFERRED, and nghttp2 library removes this stream
-  temporarily for writing.  This itself is good.  If this is the sole
-  stream in the session, nghttp2_session_want_write() returns zero,
-  which means that libcurl does not check writeability of the underlying
-  socket.  This leads to very slow upload, because it seems curl only
-  upload 16k something per 1 second.  To fix this, if we still have data
-  to send, call nghttp2_session_resume_data after nghttp2_session_send.
-  This makes nghttp2_session_want_write() returns nonzero (if connection
-  window still opens), and as a result, socket writeability is checked,
-  and upload speed becomes normal.

-  This commit requires nghttp2 v1.0.0 to compile, and migrate to v1.0.0,

-  
-  First we use nghttp2_option_set_no_recv_client_magic function to
-  detect nghttp2 v1.0.0.  That function only exists since v1.0.0.
-  
-  Since nghttp2 v0.7.5, nghttp2 ensures header field ordering, and
-  validates received header field.  If it found error, RST_STREAM with
-  PROTOCOL_ERROR is issued.  Since we require v1.0.0, we can utilize
-  this feature to simplify libcurl code.  This commit does this.
+  http2: Harden header validation for curl_pushheader_byname
   
-  Migration from 0.7 series are done based on nghttp2 migration
-  document.  For libcurl, we removed the code sending first 24 bytes
-  client magic.  It is now done by nghttp2 library.
-  on_invalid_frame_recv callback signature changed, and is updated
-  accordingly.
+  Since we do prefix match using given header by application code
+  against header name pair in format "NAME:VALUE", and VALUE part can
+  contain ":", we have to careful about existence of ":" in header
+  parameter.  ":" should be allowed to match HTTP/2 pseudo-header field,
+  and other use of ":" in header must be treated as error, and
+  curl_pushheader_byname should return NULL.  This commit implements
+  this behaviour.

+  
+  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/issues/244
+  Reported-by: Chris Araman
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 1
+  %%
+  - return 0 if len == 0. that will have to be documented.
+  - continue on and process the caches regardless of raw recv
+  - if decrypted data will be returned then set the error code to CURLE_OK
+  and return its count
+  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection has closed
+  (eg nread == 0) then return 0 and CURLE_OK
+  - if decrypted data will not be returned and the connection *hasn't*
+  closed then set the error code to CURLE_AGAIN --only if an error code
+  isn't already set-- and return -1
+  - narrow the Win2k workaround to only Win2k
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 2
+  %%
+  - Trying out a change in flow to handle corner cases.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 3
+  %%
+  - Back out the lazier decryption change made in draft2.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 4
+  %%
+  - Some formatting and branching changes
+  - Decrypt all encrypted cached data when len == 0
+  - Save connection closed state
+  - Change special Win2k check to use connection closed state
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 5
+  %%
+  - Default to CURLE_AGAIN in cleanup if an error code wasn't set and the
+  connection isn't closed.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 6
+  %%
+  - Save the last error only if it is an unrecoverable error.
+  
+  Prior to this I saved the last error state in all cases; unfortunately
+  the logic to cover that in all cases would lead to some muddle and I'm
+  concerned that could then lead to a bug in the future so I've replaced
+  it by only recording an unrecoverable error and that state will persist.
+  
+  - Do not recurse on renegotiation.
+  
+  Instead we'll continue on to process any trailing encrypted data
+  received during the renegotiation only.
+  
+  - Move the err checks in cleanup after the check for decrypted data.
+  
+  In either case decrypted data is always returned but I think it's easier
+  to understand when those err checks come after the decrypted data check.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 7
+  %%
+  - Regardless of len value go directly to cleanup if there is an
+  unrecoverable error or a close_notify was already received. Prior to
+  this change we only acknowledged those two states if len != 0.
+  
+  - Fix a bug in connection closed behavior: Set the error state in the
+  cleanup, because we don't know for sure it's an error until that time.
+  
+  - (Related to above) In the case the connection is closed go "greedy"
+  with the decryption to make sure all remaining encrypted data has been
+  decrypted even if it is not needed at that time by the caller. This is
+  necessary because we can only tell if the connection closed gracefully
+  (close_notify) once all encrypted data has been decrypted.
+  
+  - Do not renegotiate when an unrecoverable error is pending.
+  
+  %%
+  %% Draft 8
+  %%
+  - Don't show 'server closed the connection' info message twice.
   
-  avoids extra dynamic allocation
+  - Show an info message if server closed abruptly (missing close_notify).

-- openssl: fix serial number output
+  This change is to explicitly specify when we need to read/write text.
+  Unfortunately 't' is not part of POSIX fopen so we can't specify it
+  directly. Instead we now have FOPEN_READTEXT, FOPEN_WRITETEXT.
   
-  The code extracting the cert serial number was broken and didn't display
-  it properly.
+  Prior to this change we had an issue on Windows if an application that
+  uses libcurl overrides the default file mode to binary. The default file
+  mode in Windows is normally text mode (translation mode) and that's what

-  Do not access NTLM-specific struct fields when built without NTLM
-  enabled!
+  Previously, after seeing upgrade to HTTP/2, we feed data followed by
+  upgrade response headers directly to nghttp2_session_mem_recv() in
+  Curl_http2_switched().  But it turns out that passed buffer, mem, is
+  part of stream->mem, and callbacks called by

+  stream->mem, overwriting input data.  This will corrupt input, and
+  most likely frame length error is detected by nghttp2 library.  The

-- fix_hostname: zero length host name caused -1 index offset
-  
-  If a URL is given with a zero-length host name, like in "http://:80" or

-- cookie: cookie parser out of boundary memory access
-  
-  The internal libcurl function called sanitize_cookie_path() that cleans
-  up the path element as given to it from a remote site or when read from
-  a file, did not properly validate the input. If given a path that
-  consisted of a single double-quote, libcurl would index a newly

+  
+  Previously, when we send all given buffer in data_source_callback, we

+  temporarily for writing.  This itself is good.  If this is the sole
+  stream in the session, nghttp2_session_want_write() returns zero,
+  which means that libcurl does not check writeability of the underlying
+  socket.  This leads to very slow upload, because it seems curl only
+  upload 16k something per 1 second.  To fix this, if we still have data
+  to send, call nghttp2_session_resume_data after nghttp2_session_send.
+  This makes nghttp2_session_want_write() returns nonzero (if connection
+  window still opens), and as a result, socket writeability is checked,

-  lib/transfer.c: Remove factor of 8 from sleep time calculation
+  First we use nghttp2_option_set_no_recv_client_magic function to
+  detect nghttp2 v1.0.0.  That function only exists since v1.0.0.
   
-  The factor of 8 is a bytes-to-bits conversion factor, but pkt_size and
-  rate_bps are both in bytes. When using the rate limiting option, curl
-  waits 8 times too long, and then transfers very quickly until the
-  average rate reaches the limit. The average rate follows the limit over
-  time, but the actual traffic is bursty.
+  Since nghttp2 v0.7.5, nghttp2 ensures header field ordering, and
+  validates received header field.  If it found error, RST_STREAM with
+  PROTOCOL_ERROR is issued.  Since we require v1.0.0, we can utilize
+  this feature to simplify libcurl code.  This commit does this.
   
-  Thanks-to: Benjamin Gilbert
+  Migration from 0.7 series are done based on nghttp2 migration
+  document.  For libcurl, we removed the code sending first 24 bytes
+  client magic.  It is now done by nghttp2 library.

+  otherwise how HTTP works, as Negotiate can basically use NTLM under the
+  hood. curl was not adhering to this fact but would assume that such
+  requests would also be authenticated per request.
   
-  The warning is due to the carriage return. When msysgit checks out files
-  from the repo by default it converts the line endings to CRLF. Prior to
-  this change when mkhelp.pl processed the MANUAL and curl.1 in CRLF
-  format the trailing carriage returns caused unnecessary CR in the
-  output.

-  connect: Fix happy eyeballs logic for IPv4-only builds
-  
-  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/168
-  
-  (trynextip)
-  - Don't try the "other" protocol family unless IPv6 is available. In an
-  IPv4-only build the other family can only be IPv6 which is unavailable.
-  
-  This change essentially stops IPv4-only builds from attempting the
-  "happy eyeballs" secondary parallel connection that is supposed to be
-  used by the "other" address family.
-  
-  Prior to this change in IPv4-only builds that secondary parallel
-  connection attempt could be erroneously used by the same family (IPv4)
-  which caused a bug where every address after the first for a host could
-  be tried twice, often in parallel. This change fixes that bug. An
-  example of the bug is shown below.
-  
-  Assume MTEST resolves to 3 addresses 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 and 127.0.0.4:
-  
-  * STATE: INIT => CONNECT handle 0x64f4b0; line 1046 (connection #-5000)
-  * Rebuilt URL to: http://MTEST/
-  * Added connection 0. The cache now contains 1 members
-  * STATE: CONNECT => WAITRESOLVE handle 0x64f4b0; line 1083

+  vtls_openssl: improve PKCS#12 load failure error message
 
-  hostip: Fix signal race in Curl_resolv_timeout.
-  
-  A signal handler for SIGALRM is installed in Curl_resolv_timeout. It is
-  configured to interrupt system calls and uses siglongjmp to return into
-  the function if alarm() goes off.
-  
-  The signal handler is installed before curl_jmpenv is initialized.
-  This means that an already installed alarm timer could trigger the
-  newly installed signal handler, leading to undefined behavior when it
-  accesses the uninitialized curl_jmpenv.
-  
-  Even if there is no previously installed alarm available, the code in
-  Curl_resolv_timeout itself installs an alarm before the environment is
-  fully set up. If the process is sent into suspend right after that, the
-  signal handler could be called too early as in previous scenario.
-  
-  To fix this, the signal handler should only be installed and the alarm
-  timer only be set after sigsetjmp has been called.

+  
+  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/168
+  
+  (trynextip)
+  - Don't try the "other" protocol family unless IPv6 is available. In an
+  IPv4-only build the other family can only be IPv6 which is unavailable.
+  
+  This change essentially stops IPv4-only builds from attempting the
+  "happy eyeballs" secondary parallel connection that is supposed to be
+  used by the "other" address family.
+  
+  Prior to this change in IPv4-only builds that secondary parallel
+  connection attempt could be erroneously used by the same family (IPv4)
+  which caused a bug where every address after the first for a host could
+  be tried twice, often in parallel. This change fixes that bug. An
+  example of the bug is shown below.

+  The signal handler is installed before curl_jmpenv is initialized.
+  This means that an already installed alarm timer could trigger the
+  newly installed signal handler, leading to undefined behavior when it
+  accesses the uninitialized curl_jmpenv.
+  
+  Even if there is no previously installed alarm available, the code in
+  Curl_resolv_timeout itself installs an alarm before the environment is
+  fully set up. If the process is sent into suspend right after that, the
+  signal handler could be called too early as in previous scenario.
+  
+  To fix this, the signal handler should only be installed and the alarm
+  timer only be set after sigsetjmp has been called.

-- curl_schannel.c: mark session as removed from cache if not freed
+  SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations by default (and if given non-Null
+  parameters) searches the CAfile first and falls back to CApath.  This
+  allows for CAfile to be a basis (e.g. installed by the package manager)
+  and CApath to be a user configured directory.
   
-  If the session is still used by active SSL/TLS connections, it
-  cannot be closed yet. Thus we mark the session as not being cached
-  any longer so that the reference counting mechanism in
-  Curl_schannel_shutdown is used to close and free the session.

+- openssl: Fixed Curl_ossl_cert_status_request() not returning FALSE
   
-  Some instances of the curlssl_close_all() function were declared with a
-  void return type whilst others as int. The schannel version returned
-  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN and others simply returned zero, but in all cases the
-  return code was ignored by the calling function Curl_ssl_close_all().
+  Modified the Curl_ossl_cert_status_request() function to return FALSE
+  when built with BoringSSL or when OpenSSL is missing the necessary TLS
+  extensions.
+
+- openssl: Fixed compilation errors when OpenSSL built with 'no-tlsext'
   
-  For the time being and to keep the internal API consistent, changed all
-  declarations to use a void return type.
+  Fixed the build of openssl.c when OpenSSL is built without the necessary
+  TLS extensions for OCSP stapling.
   
-  To reduce code we might want to consider removing the unimplemented
-  versions and use a void #define like schannel does.

+  There is an issue with conflicting "struct timeval" definitions with

-  * WIN64 is not used in our source code
-  * The curl projects files don't define it
-  * It isn't required by or used in the platform SDK
-  * For backwards compatability curl_setup.h defines WIN32
-  * The compiler automatically defines _WIN64 for x64 builds
-  
-  Historically Visual Studio projects have defined WIN32, in addition to
-  the compiler defined _WIN32 definition, and I had incorrectly changed
-  that to WIN64 for the x64 libcurl builds but not in the curl projects.
-  
-  As such, it is questionable whether this should be defined or not. For

-    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
-    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
-    addresses.
-  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
-  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
-  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
-  to bind to an interface.
-  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
-  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
-  the interface index.
-  
-  This commit should fix SF bug #1451.

+
 .IP CURLINFO_NUM_CONNECTS
-Pass a pointer to a long to receive how many new connections libcurl had to
-create to achieve the previous transfer (only the successful connects are
-counted).  Combined with \fICURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT\fP you are able to know
-how many times libcurl successfully reused existing connection(s) or not.  See
-the Connection Options of \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP to see how libcurl tries

-need to copy the string if you want to keep the information. (Added in 7.19.0)
+IP address of the last connection.
+See \fICURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP(3)\fP
+

+List of all known cookies.
+See \fICURLINFO_COOKIELIST(3)\fP
+
 .IP CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET
-Pass a pointer to a long to receive the last socket used by this curl
-session. If the socket is no longer valid, -1 is returned. When you finish
-working with the socket, you must call curl_easy_cleanup() as usual and let
-libcurl close the socket and cleanup other resources associated with the
-handle. This is typically used in combination with
-\fICURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY(3)\fP.  (Added in 7.15.2)
+Last socket used.
+See \fICURLINFO_LASTSOCKET(3)\fP
+
+.IP CURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET
+The session's active socket.
+See \fICURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3)\fP
 
-NOTE: this API is not really working on win64, since the SOCKET type on win64
-is 64 bit large while its 'long' is only 32 bits.
 .IP CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH
-Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive a pointer to a string holding the
-path of the entry path. That is the initial path libcurl ended up in when
-logging on to the remote FTP server. This stores a NULL as pointer if
-something is wrong. (Added in 7.15.4)
+The entry path after logging in to an FTP server.
+See \fICURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH(3)\fP
 
-Also works for SFTP since 7.21.4
 .IP CURLINFO_CERTINFO
-Pass a pointer to a 'struct curl_certinfo *' and you'll get it set to point to
-struct that holds a number of linked lists with info about the certificate
-chain, assuming you had \fICURLOPT_CERTINFO(3)\fP enabled when the previous
-request was done. The struct reports how many certs it found and then you can
-extract info for each of those certs by following the linked lists. The info
-chain is provided in a series of data in the format "name:content" where the
-content is for the specific named data. See also the certinfo.c example. NOTE:
-this option is only available in libcurl built with OpenSSL, NSS or GSKit
-support. (Added in 7.19.1)
-.IP CURLINFO_TLS_SESSION
-Pass a pointer to a 'struct curl_tlssessioninfo *'.  The pointer will be
-initialized to refer to a 'struct curl_tlssessioninfo *' that will contain an
-enum indicating the SSL library used for the handshake and the respective
-internal TLS session structure of this underlying SSL library.
-
-This may then be used to extract certificate information in a format
-convenient for further processing, such as manual validation. NOTE: this
-option may not be available for all SSL backends; unsupported SSL backends
-will return 'CURLSSLBACKEND_NONE' to indicate that they are not supported;
-this does not mean that no SSL backend was used. (Added in 7.34.0)

-Pass a pointer to a long to receive the number 1 if the condition provided in
-the previous request didn't match (see \fICURLOPT_TIMECONDITION(3)\fP). Alas,
-if this returns a 1 you know that the reason you didn't get data in return is
-because it didn't fulfill the condition. The long ths argument points to will
-get a zero stored if the condition instead was met. (Added in 7.19.4)
+Whether or not a time conditional was met.

 <p class="level0">This function was added in libcurl 7.18.0. Before this version, there was no explicit support for pausing transfers. <a name="USAGE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USAGE WITH THE MULTI-SOCKET INTERFACE</h2>
 <p class="level0">Before libcurl 7.32.0, when a specific handle was unpaused with this function, there was no particular forced rechecking or similar of the socket's state, which made the continuation of the transfer get delayed until next multi-socket call invoke or even longer. Alternatively, the user could forcibly call for example curl_multi_socket_all(3) - with a rather hefty performance penalty. 
 <p class="level0">Starting in libcurl 7.32.0, unpausing a transfer will schedule a timeout trigger for that handle 1 millisecond into the future, so that a curl_multi_socket_action( ... CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT) can be used immediately afterwards to get the transfer going again as desired. <a name="MEMORY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">MEMORY USE</h2>
 <p class="level0">When pausing a read by returning the magic return code from a write callback, the read data is already in libcurl's internal buffers so it'll have to keep it in an allocated buffer until the reading is again unpaused using this function. 
 <p class="level0">If the downloaded data is compressed and is asked to get uncompressed automatically on download, libcurl will continue to uncompress the entire downloaded chunk and it will cache the data uncompressed. This has the side- effect that if you download something that is compressed a lot, it can result in a very large data amount needing to be allocated to save the data during the pause. This said, you should probably consider not using paused reading if you allow libcurl to uncompress data automatically. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>

 redirects sent by a remote server.  These redirects can refer to any kind of

 <p class="level1">Many of the protocols libcurl supports send name and password unencrypted as clear text (HTTP Basic authentication, FTP, TELNET etc). It is very easy for anyone on your network or a network nearby yours to just fire up a network analyzer tool and eavesdrop on your passwords. Don't let the fact that HTTP Basic uses base64 encoded passwords fool you. They may not look readable at a first glance, but they very easily "deciphered" by anyone within seconds.

 CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION \- follow HTTP 3xx redirects
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <curl/curl.h>
 
 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, long enable);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-A parameter set to 1 tells the library to follow any Location: header that the
-server sends as part of a HTTP header in a 3xx response.
-
-This means that libcurl will re-send the same request on the new location and
-follow new Location: headers all the way until no more such headers are
-returned. \fICURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3)\fP can be used to limit the number of
-redirects libcurl will follow.
-
-libcurl can limit to what protocols it will automatically follow. The accepted
-protocols are set with \fICURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP and it excludes the
-FILE protocol by default.
+A long parameter set to 1 tells the library to follow any Location: header
+that the server sends as part of a HTTP header in a 3xx response. The
+Location: header can specify a relative or an absolute URL to follow.
+
+libcurl will issue another request for the new URL and follow new Location:
+headers all the way until no more such headers are returned.
+\fICURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3)\fP can be used to limit the number of redirects
+libcurl will follow.
+
+libcurl limits what protocols it automatically follows to. The accepted
+protocols are set with \fICURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP. By default libcurl
+will allow all protocols on redirect except those disabled for security
+reasons: Since 7.19.4 FILE and SCP are disabled, and since 7.40.0 SMB and SMBS
+are also disabled.
+
+When following a Location:, the 3xx response code that redirected it also
+dictates which request method it will use in the subsequent request: For 301,
+302 and 303 responses libcurl will switch method to GET unless
+\fICURLOPT_POSTREDIR(3)\fP instructs libcurl otherwise. All other 3xx codes
+will make libcurl send the same method again.
 
 For users who think the existing location following is too naive, too simple
 or just lacks features, it is very easy to instead implement your own redirect
 follow logic with the use of \fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP's
-\fICURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL\fP option instead of using
+\fICURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL(3)\fP option instead of using
 \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP.

+Pass \fIversion\fP a long, set to one of the values described below. They ask
+libcurl to use the specific HTTP versions. This is not sensible to do unless
+you have a good reason. You have to set this option if you want to use
 libcurl's HTTP/2 support.
 
+Note that the HTTP version is just a request. libcurl will still prioritize to
+re-use an existing connection so it might then re-use a connection using a
+HTTP version you haven't asked for.
+
 .IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE
 We don't care about what version the library uses. libcurl will use whatever
 it thinks fit.
 .IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0
 Enforce HTTP 1.0 requests.
 .IP CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1

 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY, char *pinnedpubkey);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string can be the
 file name of your pinned public key. The file format expected is "PEM" or "DER".
 The string can also be any number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by
-"sha256//" and seperated by ";"
+"sha256//" and separated by ";"
 
 When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate
 indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from this certificate and
 if it does not exactly match the public key provided to this option, curl will
 abort the connection before sending or receiving any data.
+
+On mismatch, \fICURLE_SSL_PINNEDPUBKEYNOTMATCH\fP is returned.

 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_POSTREDIR,
                           long bitmask);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a bitmask to control how libcurl acts on redirects after POSTs that get a
 301, 302 or 303 response back.  A parameter with bit 0 set (value
-\fBCURL_REDIR_POST_301\fP) tells the library to respect RFC2616/10.3.2 and not
-convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection.
-Setting bit 1 (value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_302\fP) makes libcurl maintain the
-request method after a 302 redirect whilst setting bit 2 (value
-\fBCURL_REDIR_POST_303\fP) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a
-303 redirect. The value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_ALL\fP is a convenience define that
-sets all three bits.
+\fBCURL_REDIR_POST_301\fP) tells the library to respect RFC 7231 (section
+6.4.2 to 6.4.4) and not convert POST requests into GET requests when following
+a 301 redirection.  Setting bit 1 (value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_302\fP) makes
+libcurl maintain the request method after a 302 redirect whilst setting bit 2
+(value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_303\fP) makes libcurl maintain the request method
+after a 303 redirect. The value \fBCURL_REDIR_POST_ALL\fP is a convenience
+define that sets all three bits.
 
 The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers, so the library does the
 conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a
 POST to remain a POST after such a redirection. This option is meaningful only
 when setting \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP.

 CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXY, char *proxy);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Set the \fIproxy\fP to use for the upcoming request. The parameter should be a
-char * to a zero terminated string holding the host name or dotted IP
-address.
+char * to a zero terminated string holding the host name or dotted numerical
+IP address. A numerical IPv6 address must be written within [brackets].
 
 To specify port number in this string, append :[port] to the end of the host
 name. The proxy's port number may optionally be specified with the separate
 option \fICURLOPT_PROXYPORT(3)\fP. If not specified, libcurl will default to
 using port 1080 for proxies.

 \fBall_proxy\fP etc, if any of those are set. The \fICURLOPT_PROXY(3)\fP
 option does however override any possibly set environment variables.
 
 Setting the proxy string to "" (an empty string) will explicitly disable the
 use of a proxy, even if there is an environment variable set for it.
 
-A proxy host string given in an environment variable can also include protocol
-scheme (http://) and embedded user + password.
+A proxy host string can also include protocol scheme (http://) and embedded

 .SH DEFAULT
 Default is NULL, meaning no proxy is used.
 
 When you set a host name to use, do not assume that there's any particular
 single port number used widely for proxies. Specify it!

+<p class="level0">Set the <span Class="emphasis">proxy</span> to use for the upcoming request. The parameter should be a char * to a zero terminated string holding the host name or dotted numerical IP address. A numerical IPv6 address must be written within [brackets]. 
 <p class="level0">To specify port number in this string, append :[port] to the end of the host name. The proxy's port number may optionally be specified with the separate option <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_PROXYPORT.html">CURLOPT_PROXYPORT</a>. If not specified, libcurl will default to using port 1080 for proxies. 
 <p class="level0">The proxy string may be prefixed with [scheme]:// to specify which kind of proxy is used. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// (the last one to enable socks5 and asking the proxy to do the resolving, also known as <span Class="emphasis">CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME</span> type) to request the specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified, http:// and all others will be treated as HTTP proxies. 
 <p class="level0">Without a scheme prefix, <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE.html">CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE</a> can be used to specify which kind of proxy the string identifies. 
 <p class="level0">When you tell the library to use a HTTP proxy, libcurl will transparently convert operations to HTTP even if you specify an FTP URL etc. This may have an impact on what other features of the library you can use, such as <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_QUOTE.html">CURLOPT_QUOTE</a> and similar FTP specifics that don't work unless you tunnel through the HTTP proxy. Such tunneling is activated with <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL.html">CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL</a>. 
 <p class="level0">libcurl respects the environment variables <span Class="bold">http_proxy</span>, <span Class="bold">ftp_proxy</span>, <span Class="bold">all_proxy</span> etc, if any of those are set. The <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_PROXY.html">CURLOPT_PROXY</a> option does however override any possibly set environment variables. 
 <p class="level0">Setting the proxy string to "" (an empty string) will explicitly disable the use of a proxy, even if there is an environment variable set for it.
