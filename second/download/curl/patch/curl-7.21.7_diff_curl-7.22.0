-Daniel Stenberg (23 Jun 2011)
-- curl_formfree: clarify which pointer to free
+Daniel Stenberg (13 Sep 2011)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: ready for 7.22.0
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: mention security issue 20110623
-  
-  libcurl inappropriate GSSAPI delegation. Full details at
-  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20110623.html
+- codestyle: minor whitespace fix
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 9016958aa8989
+- [Jeff Pohlmeyer brought this change]
 
-- Curl_input_negotiate: do not delegate GSSAPI credentials
+  polarssl: build with PolarSSL-1.0.0
   
-  This is a security flaw. See curl advisory 20110623 for details.
+  With this fix, it should work for PolarSSL-1.0.0 (and SVN-1091 trunk)
+  and retain compatibility with earlier versions. (Tested with 0.14.1)
   
-  Reported by: Richard Silverman
+  PolarSSL still doesn't play nicely with curl's CA bundle (we discussed
+  this before) but I was at least able to retrieve the
+  https://www.gmail.com/ login page using a modified ca-certificates.crt
+  file with all 3 versions of PolarSSL.
 
-- [Josue Andrade Gomes brought this change]
+- BUGS: spellfixed, slightly reformatted for web looks

+
+- ftp.c: fix socket leak torture tests detected 2011-08-30
   
-  Some servers, e.g. mail.bezeqint.net:110, consider it a syntax error
+  Also fix inappropriate error handling when sending ftp EPRT or PORT commands.
 
-Yang Tse (21 Jun 2011)
-- http: fix compiler warning
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Sep 2011)
+- TODO: remove 4 entries, add one new
   
-  compiler warning: conditional expression is constant
+  Zero-copy and "Avoid having to remove/readd handles" are not really
+  features we think are worthwhile to add. Removed.
+  
+  SRP features have been added already, removed.
+  
+  11.9 IPv6 addresses with globbing added
 
-- asyn-thread: fix compiler warning
+- spell-checked comments
+
+- TODO-RELEASE: postpone the remainders
   
-  compiler warning: variable is initialized but not referenced
+  There's three pending bug fixes but there's no time left so let's
+  try to get them fixed for next release...

-- [Amr Shahin brought this change]
+- ssh.c: revert needless commit 7b7c45879e
 
-  unitteset: Curl_llist_move
+Daniel Stenberg (9 Sep 2011)
+- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 303c90074d4c
   
-  adding unit test for Curl_llist_move, documenting unit-tested functions
-  in llist.c, changing unit-test to unittest, replacing assert calls with
-  abort_unless calls
+  Five more bugfixes, one more contributor
 
-- CURLFORM_STREAM: acknowledge CURLFORM_FILENAME
+- tcpnodelay: rename variable
   
-  The CURLFORM_STREAM is documented to only insert a file name (and thus
-  look like a file upload) in the part if CURLFORM_FILENAME is set, but in
-  reality it always inserted a filename="" and if CURLFORM_FILENAME wasn't
-  set, it would insert insert rubbish (or possibly crash).
+  Renamed the variable from 'proto' to 'level' simply because it is not
+  protocol you set but level and that is the name of the argument used in
+  man pages and the POSIX documentation of the setsockopt function.
+
+Guenter Knauf (8 Sep 2011)
+- Avoid ftruncate() static define with MinGW64.
+
+Yang Tse (8 Sep 2011)
+- libssh2: use calloc as alloc function for libssh2 versions older than 1.3
   
-  This is now fixed to work as documented, and test 554 has been extended
-  to verify this.
+  This workarounds old libssh2 versions not properly initializing
+  some ssh session variables, which would trigger memory debuggers
+  warnings on memory being used without having been initialized.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (8 Sep 2011)
+- [Adriano Meirelles brought this change]
+
+  Curl_speedcheck: don't mistakenly clear Curl_expire()
   
-  Reported by: Sascha Swiercy
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-06/0070.html
+  The current version of speedcheck.c may disable timeout by setting zero
+  to Curl_expire. Which is fine using the curl_multi_perform, because it
+  recheck all timeout internals, but when using custom event poller (like
+  hiperfifo.c) it may keep stalle connection forever.

-- RELEASE-NOTES: add more contributors for this release
+- checksrc: detect "}else" uses as well
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 0aedccc18a33a778535
+- getinmemory.c: use better argument names for write callback
 
-- curl_formget: fix FILE * leak
-  
-  Properly deal with the fact that the last fread() call most probably is
-  a short read, and when using callbacks in fact all calls can be short
-  reads. No longer consider a file read done until it returns a 0 from the
-  read function.
-  
-  Reported by: Aaron Orenstein
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-06/0048.html
+Yang Tse (7 Sep 2011)
+- ssh.c: fix memory leaks triggered upon OOM or other failures
 
-- curl_formget: treat CURLFORM_STREAM better
-  
-  If a piece is set to use a callback to get the data, it should not be
-  treated as data. It unfortunately also requires that curl_easy_perform()
-  or similar has been used as otherwise the callback function hasn't been
-  figured out and curl_formget won't know how to get the content.
+- test case 583: ensure that test failures don't go unnoticed - follow-up
 
-- curl_formget.3: CURLFORM_STREAM has its drawbacks
+- test suite: libtest header inclusion cleanup - follow-up
   
-  Due to a design flaw, the CURLFORM_STREAM option doesn't really work
-  with curl_formget until after curl_easy_perform (or similar).
+  Adjust tests/libtest/Makefile.inc and remove a couple of unused headers from
+  tests/libtest/lib583.c
 
-- FAQ: binding clarification
+- test case 583: ensure that test failures don't go unnoticed
+
+- test suite: libtest header inclusion cleanup
   
-  We don't author the bindings, they are created outside the main project.
+  Added missing memoryTracking to test cases 560 and 583. If this triggers
+  leak detection on these, it only means that previously it was going unnoticed.
 
-Dan Fandrich (11 Jun 2011)
-- Added http as a dependency of test 1308
+- fix bool variables checking and assignment
 
-Daniel Stenberg (12 Jun 2011)
-- test1309: added to the dist
+- pingpong.c: avoid a memmove call in function Curl_pp_vsendf
 
-- write: add return code checks when used
-  
-  These were just warnings in test code but it still makes it nicer to not
-  generate them.
+- fix bool variables checking and assignment
 
-- long/int mess
-  
-  Typecast when converting to int from long to avoid some compiler warnings
+- test suite: use test case specific netrc file names
 
-Yang Tse (11 Jun 2011)
-- configure: OpenSSL API detection cleanup
+Guenter Knauf (4 Sep 2011)
+- Fixed final message output.
 
-Dan Fandrich (11 Jun 2011)
-- Fixed test 1309 to pass the torture test
+Daniel Stenberg (4 Sep 2011)
+- TODO-RELEASE: deleteing five issues due to no response
   
-  Removing dynamic allocations also simplifies the test.
+  No feedback and no updates, removing these issues
 
-Daniel Stenberg (10 Jun 2011)
-- splay: add unit tests
-  
-  The test code that was #ifdef'ed in the code was converted into unit
-  tests in test case 1309. I also removed the #if 0'ed code from splay.c
+Yang Tse (4 Sep 2011)
+- setup_once.h cleanup and sync
 
-- unittest: mark all unit tested functions
-  
-  With "@unittest: [num]" in the header comment for each tested function.
-  Shows we have a log way to go still...
+Guenter Knauf (4 Sep 2011)
+- Fix to skip untrusted certs.
 
-- CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER: clarify the docs
+- Added SPNEGO to MinGW makefiles.
 
-- unit test formpost: added test case 1308
-  
-  This is a few first rather basic tests of curl_formadd() and
-  curl_formget(). Should serve as building blocks to add more variations
-  to the test.
+Yang Tse (4 Sep 2011)
+- NTLM WB: fix file descriptor leak upon OOM condition
 
-Yang Tse (9 Jun 2011)
-- configure: warn if OpenSSL headers and library versions don't match
+- revert changes not intended to be pushed with commit 6b75d2c2
 
-- configure: get API info for a couple of OpenSSL functions (followup 2)

+- Some MinGW makefile tweaks for MinGW64.
 
-- configure: fix recvfrom 5th arg type qualifier detection
+- Changed MinGW to use own winidn prototypes.
 
-Kamil Dudka (8 Jun 2011)
-- disconnect: wipe out the keeps_speed time stamp
-  
-  When closing a connection, the speedchecker's timestamp is now deleted
-  so that it cannot accidentally be used by a fresh connection on the same
-  handle when examining the transfer speed.
+Dan Fandrich (2 Sep 2011)
+- Fix NTLM winbind support to pass the torture tests
   
-  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/679709
-
-Yang Tse (7 Jun 2011)
-- urldata: use uniform inclusion style for OpenSSL headers
+  Calling sclose() both in the child and the parent fools the
+  socket leak detector into thinking it's been closed twice.
+  Calling close() in the child instead overcomes this problem. It's
+  not as portable as the sclose() macro, but this code is highly
+  POSIX-specific, anyway.
 
-Daniel Stenberg (7 Jun 2011)
-- HTTP time condition: force closure for 200 OK
+Yang Tse (2 Sep 2011)
+- MemoryTracking: fix logging of free() calls done where Curl_safefree is called
   
-  When a time condition isn't met, so that no body is delivered to the
-  application even though a 2xx response is being read from the server, we
-  must close the connection to avoid a re-use of the connection to be
-  completely tricked.
+  Just internal stuff...
   
-  Added test 1128 to verify.
+  Curl_safefree is now a macro defined in memdebug.h instead of a function
+  prototyped in url.h and implemented in url.c, so inclusion of url.h is no
+  longer required in order to simply use Curl_safefree.
+  
+  Provide definition of macro WHILE_FALSE in setup_once.h in order to allow
+  other macros such as DEBUGF and DEBUGASSERT, and code using it, to compile
+  without 'conditional expression is constant' warnings.
+  
+  The WHILE_FALSE stuff fixes 150+ MSVC compiler warnings.
 
-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with b772f3a32146d7d
+- transfer.c: fix parentheses/braces placement for vi/emacs delimiter matching
 
-Yang Tse (6 Jun 2011)
-- configure: get API info for a couple of OpenSSL functions
+- transfer.c: fix loadhostpairs() OOM handling
 
-Daniel Stenberg (5 Jun 2011)
-- wait_ms: takes an int argument
+- test harness: https, ftps and ssh servers allowed start up time increased 33%
+
+- hostip.c: return immediately from Curl_resolv_timeout() upon expired timeout.
   
-  Typecasts added since I changed more code to use long for timeouts
+  Ensure existing logic in Curl_resolv_timeout() is not subverted upon getting a
+  negative timeout from resolve_server(). The timeout in resolve_server() could
+  be checked to avoid calling Curl_resolv_timeout() with an expired timeout, but
+  fixing this in this way allows existing logic in resolve_server() to be kept
+  unchanged.
 
-- Curl_socket_ready: make timeout a 'long'
+- ftp.c: fix some leaks torture tests detected 2011-08-30 - follow-up
   
-  It was mostly typecasted to int all over the code so switching to long
-  instead all over should be a net gain.
+  follow-up for commit d20408e8
 
-Yang Tse (4 Jun 2011)
-- xlc: avoid preprocessor definition usage when linking
+- test harness: fix detection of test harness client knownhosts file
+  
+  Regenerate curl's tests client knownhosts file also when, somehow,
+  this file is empty.
 
-- unit tests: disable unit tests for a given cross-compilation configuration.
+- test harness: fix detection of test harness host and client key files
   
-  cross-compilation of unit tests static library/programs fails when
-  libcurl shared library is also built. This might be due to a libtool or
-  automake issue. In this case we disable unit tests.
+  Regenerate curl's tests host and client key files also when, somehow,
+  any of these files are empty.

-Daniel Stenberg (1 Jun 2011)
-- CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH: minor style edit
+- NTLM_WB: final congruency naming adjustments
   
-  Due to some flaw in roffit I removed some style changes to make the web

+  Preprocessor symbol USE_NTLM_SSO renamed to WINBIND_NTLM_AUTH_ENABLED.

-- unit tests: build adjustment
+- base64: fix Curl_base64_encode and Curl_base64_decode interfaces
   
-  Also define UNITTESTS macro when building unit test sources.
+  Previous interfaces for these libcurl internal functions did not allow to tell
+  apart a legitimate zero size result from an error condition. These functions
+  now return a CURLcode indicating function success or otherwise specific error.
+  Output size is returned using a pointer argument.
   
-  Fixing compiler warning: external definition with no prior declaration
+  All usage of these two functions, and others closely related, has been adapted
+  to the new interfaces. Relative error and OOM handling adapted or added where
+  missing. Unit test 1302 also adapted.

+- MemoryTracking: adjust curl_domalloc() and curl_dofree() memory filling
   
-  Fix compiler warning: unused variable 'data'
+  Until 2011-08-17 libcurl's Memory Tracking feature also performed
+  automatic malloc and free filling operations using 0xA5 and 0x13
+  values. Our own preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory
+  might be useful when not using third party memory debuggers, but
+  on the other hand this would fool memory debuggers into thinking
+  that all dynamically allocated memory is properly initialized.
+  
+  As a default setting, libcurl's Memory Tracking feature no longer
+  performs preinitialization of dynamically allocated memory on its
+  own. If you know what you are doing, and really want to retain old
+  behavior, you can achieve this compiling with preprocessor symbols
+  CURL_MT_MALLOC_FILL and CURL_MT_FREE_FILL defined with appropriate
+  values.

-  Test 585: Fix opensocket return type, and avoid function name clash.
+  Strict splitting of http_ntlm.[ch] may trigger 8 compiler warnings when
+  building with some compilers and strict compiler warnings enabled, depending
+  on other specific configuration options some could get triggered or not.
+  
+  Seven are related with 'unused function parameters' and another one with
+  'var may be used before its value is set'.
 
-- version: linkage fix
+- http NTLM: split http_ntlm.[ch] between http_ntlm.[ch] and curl_ntlm.[ch]
   
-  Fix linkage on c-ares enabled Windows static builds
+  For modularity purposes, huge chunks of NTLM existing code is transformed into
+  functions to allow future internal code reuse.
+  
+  Resulting three new libcurl private functions:
+  
+   - Curl_ntlm_create_type1_message()
+   - Curl_ntlm_create_type3_message()
+   - Curl_ntlm_decode_type2_message()
+  
+  Changing static ntlm_sspi_cleanup() into non-static Curl_ntlm_sspi_cleanup()
+  
+  This 'refactoring' has been prepared by previous commits to allow that this
+  specific one does not introduce any change to existing code. All existing
+  goodness and badness previous to this commit should remain the same once it is
+  applied, the only difference should be that existing code is moved into
+  functions.
+  
+  Given the quite big portions of code being moved around, and the importance of
+  change traceability, this commit has been done in such a way that it is
+  possible to perform a three-way diff from initial http_ntlm.[ch] to resulting
+  http_ntlm.[ch] and curl_ntlm.[ch] to actually verify that no functional change
+  is introduced here.
+  
+  Notice that Steve Holme has provided several patches, but these included this
+  refactoring along with 'extra' fixes. I really wanted this 'clean' refactoring
+  done first, in order to allow discussion or committing of 'extra' fixes on a
+  case by case basis, so, I had to bite the bullet ;-)
+  
+  Comments, line adjustments, compiler warning fixes, whatever, may follow

-Daniel Stenberg (27 Apr 2011)
-- make: add checksrc.pl to dist
-
-- make: add 'checksrc' as target to check code style
+  Allow compilation of libcurl and curl using BSD-style lwIP on Win32.
   
-  The make target checksrc now works in the root makefile and in both the
-  src and lib directories.
+  In order to compile libcurl and curl with this support it is necessary
+  to edit files lib/config-win32.h and src/config-win32.h and uncomment
+  a line to make definition of preprocessor symbol USE_LWIPSOCK visible.
   
-  It is also run automatically on "all" if configure --enable-debug was
-  used.
-
-- checksrc: whitespace and code style cleanup
+  Afterwards you can compile as usual.
   
-  Make everything adhere to the standards upheld by checksrc.pl and now
-  run checksrc from the makefile on debug builds.
-
-- checksrc: add -W to allow a file to be whitelisted
+  In order to use compiled library with BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack in
+  your program it is mandatory that you include lwIP header file <lwip/opt.h>
+  before including <curl/curl.h> or <curl/multi.h>
   
-  Useful when a known file just doesn't comply and there's no intention to
-  make it do so.
-
-- whitespace cleanup: no space first in conditionals
+  Compilation has been verified with lwIP 1.4.0 and contrib-1.4.0 from:
   
-  "if(a)" is our style, not "if( a )"
+  http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lwip/lwip-1.4.0.zip

+- TODO-RELEASE: issue #290 fixed
   
-  Since it now supports multiple files this will be faster and will show
-  problems for more file than one at a time - more convenient.
+  Closed this entry:
+  290 - bug 3375603 "curl has problem with remote names containing ';'"
 
-- checksrc: scan many files, more checks
+- -J: support ';' in quoted file names
   
-  It now scans multiple files and outputs an error+warning count summary
-  at the end in case at least one was detected.
+  Content-disposition headers can provide file names with semicolons which
+  previously would be cut off at that point.
   
-  -D can be used to specify in which dir the files are located
+  Added test case 1311 and 1312 to verify -J.
   
-  The script now scans for conditions that starts with a space for
-  if/while/for lines.

+- NTLM single-sign on adjustments (VIII)
   
-  asyn-ares.c and asyn-thread.c are two separate backends that implement

-  specified at build time.
+  Use preprocessor symbols WINBIND_NTLM_AUTH_ENABLED and WINBIND_NTLM_AUTH_FILE
+  for Samba's winbind daemon ntlm_auth helper code implementation and filename.
   
-  The internal resolver API is defined in asyn.h for asynch resolvers.
-
-- asynch resolvers: cleanup

+Daniel Stenberg (22 Jul 2011)

+
+  progress: reset flags at transfer start
   
-  Make sure that files are closed before the post quote commands run as if
-  they operate on the just transferred file they could otherwise easily
-  fail.
+  When an easy handle is used to download an URI which has no
+  Content-Length header (or equivalent) after downloading an URI which
+  does, the value from the previous transfer is reused and returned by
+  CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD. This is because the progress flags
+  (used to determine whether such a header was received) are not reset
+  between transfers.

+- RELEASE-NOTES: HTTP error handling on request body send
 
-Daniel Stenberg (20 Apr 2011)
-- Curl_http_connect: detect HTTPS properly after CONNECT
+- http error response: stop sending when error is received
   
-  libcurl failed to check the correct struct for HTTPS after CONNECT was
-  issued to the proxy, so it didn't do the TLS handshake and subsequently
-  failed the connection. A regression released in 7.21.5 (introduced
-  around commit 8831000bc07de).
+  When libcurl has said to the server that there's a POST or PUT coming
+  (with a content-length and all) it has to either deliver that amount of
+  data or it needs to close the connection before trying a second request.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-04/0134.html
-  Reported by: Josue Andrade Gomes
-
-- curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE clarification

-  and the ./[lib|src]/Makefile.m32 parses the CFG var to determine

-
-- Enabled MinGW native Windows IDN build.

-  Added CURLOPT_TRANSFER_ENCODING as the option to set to request Transfer
-  Encoding in HTTP requests (if built zlib enabled). I also renamed

-- TE: do the Connection: header
+Daniel Stenberg (13 Jul 2011)
+- gssapi: rename our files to avoid conflicts
   
-  When TE: is inserted in the request, we must add a "Connection: TE" as
-  well to be HTTP 1.1 compliant. If a custom Connection: header is passed
-  in, we must use that and only append TE to it. Test case 1125 verifies
-  TE: + custom Connection:.
+  gssapi.h is used as a header name by Heimdal-style GSSAPI so it would
+  conflict with a private header using that name, and while renaming the
+  header I figured we should name the .c file accordingly as well.

+  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2011-07/0071.html
+  Reported by: Ben Greear
 
-- test1124: verify gzip AND chunked transfer-encoding
+- silence picky compilers: mark unused parameters
+  
+  Modern gcc versions (4.6.X) get more picky by default and have started
+  to warn for unused parameters, but luckily gcc also allows us to mark
+  them as unused so that we can avoid the warnings.
 
-- TE: rename struct field content_encoding
+Julien Chaffraix (12 Jul 2011)
+- gssapi.c: Simplified the function.
   
-  Since this struct member is used in the code to determine what and how
-  to decode automatically and since it is now also used for compressed
-  Transfer-Encodings, I renamed it to the more suitable 'auto_decoding'
+  Removed the parameters that were common to all our invocation.
 
-- HTTP: add support for gzip and deflate Transfer-Encoding
+- Added Curl_gss_init_sec_context.
   
-  Transfer-Encoding differs from Content-Encoding in a few subtle ways,
-  but primarily it concerns the transfer only and not the content so when
-  discovered to be compressed we know we have to uncompress it. There will
-  only arrive compressed transfers in a response after we have requested
-  them with the appropriate TE: header.
+  This function wraps our calls to gss_init_sec_context so that we
+  have a unified way to talk to GSSAPI.
+
+- http_negociate: Be consistent in gss_init_sec_context attributes.
   
-  Test case 1122 and 1123 verify.
+  This change makes this callsite match the rest of the code.

-- curl-config: fix --version
+- polarssl.h: remove CVS leftover
+
+- help output: more gnu like output
   
-  curl-config --version didn't output the correct version string (bug
-  introduced in commit 0355e33b5f7b234cf3), and unfortunately the test
-  case 1022 that was supposed to check for this was broken.
+  First, the -J/--remote-header-name was wrongly sorted in the --help
+  output as pointed out in bug report #3349271.
   
-  This change fixes the test to detect this problem and it fixes the
-  output.
+  Then, I changed the format of the texts to follow the man page better in
+  that it now uses "-A, --long" intead of "-A/--long". I also made all
+  additional arguments get written as in "-A, --long FILENAME" instead of
+  the previous "<filename>" style.

+- curl_formget: treat CURLFORM_STREAM better
   
-  I'm sure the warnings could be fixed the "proper" way or with some added
-  "#pragma" statements. But that just clutters the sources IMHO.
+  If a piece is set to use a callback to get the data, it should not be
+  treated as data. It unfortunately also requires that curl_easy_perform()
+  or similar has been used as otherwise the callback function hasn't been
+  figured out and curl_formget won't know how to get the content.
+
+- curl_formget.3: CURLFORM_STREAM has its drawbacks
   
-  * $(MKDIR) and $(RMDIR) have been replaced with the shell-commands 'md'
-   and 'rd'. When having MingW/Msys programs 'mkdir.exe' and 'rmdir.exe' in
-  $PATH, this confuses Borland's make and the result (the cleaning etc.) would

+  Due to a design flaw, the CURLFORM_STREAM option doesn't really work

+
+- FAQ: binding clarification
   
-  * Added a ".path.int = $(OBJDIR)" to tell make where the $(PREPROCESSED)
-   files are. Why we need the preprocess step in the fist place is beyond me
-  (Yang?). But I'll leave that for now.
+  We don't author the bindings, they are created outside the main project.

-  like a resource shortage or similar.
+  When a time condition isn't met, so that no body is delivered to the
+  application even though a 2xx response is being read from the server, we
+  must close the connection to avoid a re-use of the connection to be
+  completely tricked.
   
-  CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION is the option formerly known as
-  CURLE_UNKNOWN_TELNET_OPTION (and the old name is still present,
-  separately defined to be removed in a very distant future). This error
-  code is meant to be used to return when an option is given to libcurl
-  that isn't known. This problem would mostly indicate a problem in the
-  program that uses libcurl.

-- nss: do not ignore value of CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER
-  
-  When NSS-powered libcurl connected to a SSL server with
-  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to zero, NSS remembered that the peer
-  certificate was accepted by libcurl and did not ask the second time when
-  connecting to the same server with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER equal to one.
+Yang Tse (19 May 2011)
+- tests: verify OPEN/CLOSESOCKETFUNCTION
   
-  This patch turns off the SSL session cache for the particular SSL socket
-  if peer verification is disabled.  In order to avoid any performance
-  impact, the peer verification is completely skipped in that case, which
-  makes it even faster than before.

+- checksrc: trailing whitespace detection fix
+
+- [Marcel Roelofs brought this change]
+
+  negotiate sspi: fix sequential requests
+
+- tests: added HTTP If-Modified-Since tests
   
-  The PROT_* set of internal defines for the protocols is no longer
-  used. We now use the same bits internally as we have defined in the
-  public header using the CURLPROTO_ prefix. This is for simplicity and
-  because the PROT_* prefix was already used duplicated internally for a
-  set of KRB4 values.
+  Added test 1126 and 1127 to verify curl's behaviour when If-Modified-Since
+  is used and a 200 is returned.
   
-  The PROTOPT_* defines were moved up to just below the struct definition
-  within which they are used.
+  The list of test cases in Makefile.am is now sorted numerically.
 
-- protocol handler: added flags field
+- include: cleanup
   
-  The protocol handler struct got a 'flags' field for special information
-  and characteristics of the given protocol.
+  Made the public headers checksrc compliant
   
-  This now enables us to move away central protocol information such as
-  CLOSEACTION and DUALCHANNEL from single defines in a central place, out
-  to each protocol's definition. It also made us stop abusing the protocol
-  field for other info than the protocol, and we could start cleaning up
-  other protocol-specific things by adding flags bits to set in the
-  handler struct.
+  Removed types.h (it's been unused since April 2004)
   
-  The "protocol" field connectdata struct was removed as well and the code
-  now refers directly to the conn->handler->protocol field instead. To
-  make things work properly, the code now always store a conn->given
-  pointer that points out the original handler struct so that the code can
-  learn details from the original protocol even if conn->handler is
-  modified along the way - for example when switching to go over a HTTP
-  proxy.
+  Made the root makefile do make in include by default as well, so that
+  TAGS and the checksrc will work better.

+  make it static, remove Curl_ prefix
 
-- SSH: add protocol lock direction
+- remove FILE protocol-specific checks
   
-  Some protocols have to call the underlying functions without regard to
-  what exact state the socket signals. For example even if the socket says
-  "readable", the send function might need to be called while uploading,
-  or vice versa. This is the case for libssh2 based protocols: SCP and
-  SFTP and we now introduce a define to set those protocols and we make
-  the multi interface code aware of this concept.
-  
-  This is another fix to make test 582 run properly.
+  Also, convert the BANPROXY flag into NONETWORK for the protocols
+  (file:// only atm) that don't work over networks.
 
-- state: add missing state to debug table

-- test 582: enabled again
+- socks proxy: allow socks5h:// prefix too
   
-  Commit ca37692bf43b5ef should now hopefully make it run

-  multi: close connection on timeout
+- SFTP: close file before postquote
   
-  After a request times out, the connection wasn't properly closed and
-  prevented to get re-used, so subsequent transfers could still mistakenly
-  get to use the previously aborted connection.
-
-- multi: better failed connect treatment
+  Make sure that files are closed before the post quote commands run as if
+  they operate on the just transferred file they could otherwise easily
+  fail.
   
-  When failing to connect the protocol during the CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT
-  state, Curl_done() has to be called with the premature flag set TRUE as
-  for the pingpong protocols this can be important.

+- Curl_http_connect: detect HTTPS properly after CONNECT
   
-  When Curl_done() is called with premature == TRUE, it needs to call
-  Curl_disconnect() with its 'dead_connection' argument set to TRUE as
-  well so that any protocol handler's disconnect function won't attempt to
-  use the (control) connection for anything.
+  libcurl failed to check the correct struct for HTTPS after CONNECT was
+  issued to the proxy, so it didn't do the TLS handshake and subsequently
+  failed the connection. A regression released in 7.21.5 (introduced
+  around commit 8831000bc07de).
   
-  This problem caused the pingpong protocols to fail to disconnect when
-  STARTTLS failed.

-- --keepalive-time: warn if not supported properly
+- TE: do the Connection: header
   
-  Since the feature requires support for TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL to
-  function as documented, it now warns if that support is missing when the
-  option is used.
+  When TE: is inserted in the request, we must add a "Connection: TE" as
+  well to be HTTP 1.1 compliant. If a custom Connection: header is passed
+  in, we must use that and only append TE to it. Test case 1125 verifies
+  TE: + custom Connection:.

+  Since this struct member is used in the code to determine what and how

+  Transfer-Encodings, I renamed it to the more suitable 'auto_decoding'
 
-- test1304: Added some unit tests for Curl_parsenetrc.
+- HTTP: add support for gzip and deflate Transfer-Encoding
   
-  Moved some definitons into the header file so that we can reuse them.

-Daniel Stenberg (9 Feb 2011)
-- [Quinn Slack brought this change]
-
-  CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED: removed
+  Transfer-Encoding differs from Content-Encoding in a few subtle ways,
+  but primarily it concerns the transfer only and not the content so when
+  discovered to be compressed we know we have to uncompress it. There will
+  only arrive compressed transfers in a response after we have requested
+  them with the appropriate TE: header.
   
-  On second thought, I think CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED should be eliminated. It
-  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
-  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
-  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems
-  appropriate; its error string already includes "passwords" as a possible
-  cause. Having a separate TLS auth error code might also cause people to
-  think that a TLS auth failure means the wrong username or password was
-  entered, when it could also be a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack.

+Daniel Stenberg (5 Apr 2011)
+- return code cleanup: build, init and run-time errors
   
-  The idea that the protocol and socktype is part of name resolving in the

-  TCP/STREAM and we make sure that when we want to connect to a UDP
-  service we use the correct UDP/DGRAM set instead. This bug was because
-  the ->protocol field was not always set correctly.

-  SSL: fix memory leak
+  CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN replaces return code 4 that has been obsoleted for
+  several years. It is used for returning error when something is
+  attempted to be used but the feature/option was not enabled or
+  explictitly disabled at build-time. Getting this error mostly means that
+  libcurl needs to be rebuilt.
   
-  In OOM situation. Follow-up fix to commit a9cd4f4ed49e1a0.
+  CURLE_FAILED_INIT is now saved and used strictly for init
+  failures. Getting this problem means something went seriously wrong,
+  like a resource shortage or similar.
+  
+  CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION is the option formerly known as
+  CURLE_UNKNOWN_TELNET_OPTION (and the old name is still present,
+  separately defined to be removed in a very distant future). This error
+  code is meant to be used to return when an option is given to libcurl
+  that isn't known. This problem would mostly indicate a problem in the
+  program that uses libcurl.

+  The RTSP-specific function for checking for "dead" connection is better

+  271 - fix the IPv6-working probing to only exist at one place in the code and
+        only get done once
   
-  Since some systems don't have PATH_MAX and it isn't that clever to
-  assume a fixed maximum path length, the code now allocates buffer space
-  instead of using stack.
+  A problem not repeatable and no proper recipe given and therefore simply
+  removed for now until we hear something else:

-  the same parser.
-
-- pubkey_show: allocate buffer to fit any-size result
+  Move ipv6-functional-probe into a single function that is used from all

-  The loop condition was wrong so keys larger than 340 bits would overflow

-- c-ares: fix cancelled resolves
+- retry-request: rewind if data was sent
   
-  When built IPv6-enabled, we could do Curl_done() with one of the two
-  resolves having returned already, so when ares_cancel() is called the
-  resolve callback ends up doing funny things (sometimes resulting in a
-  segfault) since it would try to actually store the previous resolve even
-  though we're shutting down the resolve.
+  When libcurl sends a HTTP request on a re-used connection and detects it
+  being closed (ie no data at all was read from it), it is important to
+  rewind if any data in the request was sent using the read callback or
+  was read from file, as otherwise the retried request will be broken.

+  The PROT_* set of internal defines for the protocols is no longer

-- [Tommie Gannert brought this change]
+  The PROTOPT_* defines were moved up to just below the struct definition
+  within which they are used.
 
-  ares: ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
-  
-  Make the c-ares resolver code ask for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses when
-  IPv6 is enabled.
+- protocol handler: added flags field
   
-  This is a workaround for the missing ares_getaddrinfo() and is a lot
-  easier to implement.
+  The protocol handler struct got a 'flags' field for special information
+  and characteristics of the given protocol.
   
-  Note that as long as c-ares returns IPv4 addresses when IPv6 addresses
-  were requested but missing, this will cause a host's IPv4 addresses to
-  occur twice in the DNS cache.

+- SSH: add protocol lock direction
+  
+  Some protocols have to call the underlying functions without regard to
+  what exact state the socket signals. For example even if the socket says
+  "readable", the send function might need to be called while uploading,
+  or vice versa. This is the case for libssh2 based protocols: SCP and
+  SFTP and we now introduce a define to set those protocols and we make
+  the multi interface code aware of this concept.
+  
+  This is another fix to make test 582 run properly.
 
-  smtp-tls: new example
+- state: add missing state to debug table

-- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with a865bd9fbaaa43e5c
+  Both SFTP and SCP are protocols that need to shut down stuff properly
+  when the connection is about to get torned down. The primary effect of

-  protocols.

-- multi_runsingle: don't timeout completed handles
+- sftp upload: expire to advance state machine
   
-  The generic timeout code must not check easy handles that are already
-  completed. Going to completed (again) within there risked decreasing the
-  number of alive handles again and thus it could go negative.
+  When using the multi_socket API to do SFTP upload, it is important that
+  we set a quick expire when leaving the SSH_SFTP_UPLOAD_INIT state as
+  there's nothing happening on the socket so there's no read or write to
+  wait for, but the next libssh2 API function needs to be called to get

-- gnutls->handshake: improved timeout handling
+  When failing to connect the protocol during the CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT
+  state, Curl_done() has to be called with the premature flag set TRUE as
+  for the pingpong protocols this can be important.
   
-  When no timeout is set, we call the socket_ready function with a timeout
-  value of 0 during handshake, which makes it loop too much/fast in this
-  function. It also made this function return CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT
-  wrongly on a slow handshake.
+  When Curl_done() is called with premature == TRUE, it needs to call
+  Curl_disconnect() with its 'dead_connection' argument set to TRUE as
+  well so that any protocol handler's disconnect function won't attempt to
+  use the (control) connection for anything.
   
-  However, the particular bug report that highlighted this problem is not
-  solved by this fix, as this fix only makes the more proper error get
-  reported instead.

+  STARTTLS failed.

-- HTTP Auth: Add CURLAUTH_ONLY
-  
-  This is a meta symbol. OR this value together with a single specific
-  auth value to force libcurl to probe for un-restricted auth and if not,
-  only that single auth algorithm is acceptable.
-  
-  For example you can use CURLAUTH_DIGEST|CURLAUTH_ONLY to make libcurl
-  first probe for what method to use, but yet only consider Digest to be
-  acceptable.
+Dan Fandrich (10 Feb 2011)
+- Call ERR_peek_error instead of ERR_peek_last_error
   
-  Using _only_ CURLAUTH_DIGEST without the CURLAUTH_ONLY field, will make
-  libcurl explicitly use Digest right away and not do any probing.
+  The latter isn't available in older OpenSSL versions, and is
+  less useful since it returns the most recent error instead of
+  the first one encountered.
 
-- ip_version: moved to connection struct
-  
-  The IP version choice was previously only in the UserDefined struct
-  within the SessionHandle, but since we sometimes alter that option
-  during a request we need to have it on a per-connection basis.

-- configure: use autobuilds to temporarily exercise xattr function tests
+  CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED: removed
+  
+  On second thought, I think CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED should be eliminated. It
+  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
+  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
+  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems
+  appropriate; its error string already includes "passwords" as a possible
+  cause. Having a separate TLS auth error code might also cause people to

-- URL-parsing: consider ? a divider
-  
-  The URL parser got a little stricter as it now considers a ? to be a
-  host name divider so that the slightly sloppier URLs work too. The
-  problem that made me do this change was the reported problem with an URL
-  like: www.example.com?email=name@example.com This form of URL is not
-  really a legal URL (due to the missing slash after the host name) but is
-  widely accepted by all major browsers and libcurl also already accepted
-  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
-  
-  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the
-  ?  letter as part of user-name or password when given in the URL, which
-  it used to accept (and is tested in test 191). That letter is however
-  mentioned in RFC3986 to be required to be percent encoded since it is
-  used as a divider.

-- SFTP: more ignoring negative file sizes
+- Curl_nss_connect: avoid PATH_MAX
   
-  As the change in 5f0ae7a0626cbe709 added a precaution against negative
-  file sizes that for some reason managed to get returned, this change now
-  introduces the same check at the second place in the code where the file
-  size from the libssh2 stat call is used.
+  Since some systems don't have PATH_MAX and it isn't that clever to
+  assume a fixed maximum path length, the code now allocates buffer space
+  instead of using stack.
   
-  This check might not be suitable for a 32 bit curl_off_t, but libssh2.h
-  assumes long long to work and to be 64 bit so I believe such a small
-  curl_off_t will be very unlikely to occur in the wild.

-- FAQ: CURL_STATICLIB for visual studio users
+  When no timeout is set, we call the socket_ready function with a timeout
+  value of 0 during handshake, which makes it loop too much/fast in this

+  wrongly on a slow handshake.
   
-  Clarified as it isn't used with a -D option for them.
+  However, the particular bug report that highlighted this problem is not

-- multi: fixes for timing out handles
-  
-  Add a timeout check for handles in the state machine so that they will
-  timeout in all states disregarding what actions that may or may not
-  happen.
-  
-  Fixed a bug in socket_action introduced recently when looping over timed
-  out handles: it wouldn't assign the 'data' variable and thus it wouldn't
-  properly take care of handles.
+- security: Pass the right parameter to init.
   
-  In the update_timer function, the code now checks if the timeout has
-  been removed and then it tells the application. Previously it would
-  always let the remaining timeout(s) just linger to expire later on.
+  init is expecting app_data. Passing it the struct connecdata would make
+  us crash later.
 
-- threaded resolver: no more expire 0 calls
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Nov 2010)
+- HTTP Auth: Add CURLAUTH_ONLY
   
-  Curl_expire() set to 0 expires ALL timeouts so it should only be called
-  if we truly and really want to remove all timeouts for the handle.
-
-- resolve_server: simplify code
+  This is a meta symbol. OR this value together with a single specific
+  auth value to force libcurl to probe for un-restricted auth and if not,
+  only that single auth algorithm is acceptable.
   
-  Make use of the helper function Curl_timeleft() instead of duplicating
-  code.
+  For example you can use CURLAUTH_DIGEST|CURLAUTH_ONLY to make libcurl
+  first probe for what method to use, but yet only consider Digest to be
+  acceptable.
+  
+  Using _only_ CURLAUTH_DIGEST without the CURLAUTH_ONLY field, will make
+  libcurl explicitly use Digest right away and not do any probing.
 
-- multi: make sure the next timeout is used when one expires
+- ip_version: moved to connection struct
   
-  Each easy handle has a list of timeouts, so as soon as the main timeout
-  for a handle expires, we must make sure to get the next entry from the
-  list and re-add the handle to the splay tree.
+  The IP version choice was previously only in the UserDefined struct
+  within the SessionHandle, but since we sometimes alter that option
+  during a request we need to have it on a per-connection basis.
   
-  This was attempted previously but was done poorly in my commit

-  The script works exactly same as the Perl one except for one thing:
-  when the text descriptions generated with openssl are included then
-  the md5 fingerprints are missing; seems openssl has either a bug or
-  a feature which prints the md5 fingerprint output to stdout instead
-  of writing them to specified file; this script could here do the same
-  as what the Perl scripr does (redirect stdout into file) but this
-  makes the script take up double the time because it needs to launch

-  When detecting that the send or recv speed, the multi interface changes

-  again.
+- test1119: verify symbols-in-versions
 
-- multi: support timeouts
-  
-  Curl_expire() is now expanded to hold a list of timeouts for each easy
-  handle. Only the closest in time will be the one used as the primary
-  timeout for the handle and will be used for the splay tree (which sorts
-  and lists all handles within the multi handle).
-  
-  When the main timeout has triggered/expired, the next timeout in time
-  that is kept in the list will be moved to the main timeout position and
-  used as the key to splay with. This way, all timeouts that are set with
-  Curl_expire() internally will end up as a proper timeout. Previously any
-  Curl_expire() that set a _later_ timeout than what was already set was
-  just silently ignored and thus missed.

+  If a command is set type="perl", it can now specify a perl program that will
+  be run instead of an ordinary curl or built tool.

-- multi: make curl_multi_info_read perform O(1)

-  perform O(1) no matter how many easy handles that are handled. This is
-  of importance since this function may be polled very frequently by apps

-- runtests: clear old setenv remainders before test
-  
-  Due to the layout of the singletest function there are situations where
-  it returns before it clears the environment variables that were
-  especially set for the single specific test case. That could lead to
-  subsequent tests getting executed with environment variables sticking
-  around from a previous test which could lead to badness.
+- test: added test 580 - verifies symbols-in-versions
   
-  This change makes sure to clear all custom variables that may be laying
-  around from a previous round, before running a test case.
+  The new perl script mk580.pl generates a C table in a fresh source file
+  named lib580.c and if that compiles fine we know that the file
+  docs/libcurl/symbols-in-versions at least doesn't include any symbols
+  that are misspelled.

+- SSH: use libssh2_session_handshake()
   
-  Added the -br switch to dynamic builds which fixes the issue I saw
-  with curl's --version output. Added debug info and symfile for debug
-  builds to linker opts. Added DLL loader for wlink back, but this time
-  dependend on wlink version.
-  Patch posted to the list by malak.jiri AT gmail.com.
+  In libssh2 1.2.8, libssh2_session_handshake() replaces
+  libssh2_session_startup() to fix the previous portability problem with
+  the socket type that was too small for win64 and thus easily could cause
+  crashes and more.
 
-- Changed test for -u switch in order to enable other wmake switches.
+- SSH: avoid using the libssh2_ prefix
   
-  The var %MAKEFLAGS is only set in 3 cases: if set as environment
-  var or as macro definition from commandline, and either with the
-  -u or -ms switch. Since all these cases are unlikely for the average
-  user it should be safe to only test if %MAKEFLAGS is defined; this
-  has the benefit that now all other switches can be used again in
-  addition to the -u which was formerly not possible.
+  It is a bad idea to use the public prefix used by another library and
+  now we realize that libssh2 introduces a symbol in the upcoming version
+  1.2.8 that conflicts with our static function named libssh2_free.

-- parse_remote_port: fix ;type= URL suffix over HTTP proxy
+  When failing to build form post due to an error, the code now does a
+  proper failf(). Previously libcurl would report an error like "failed
+  creating formpost data" when a file wasn't possible to open which was
+  not easy for users to figure out.
   
-  Test 563 is enabled now and verifies that the combo FTP type=A URL,
-  CURLOPT_PORT set and proxy work fine. As a bonus I managed to remove the
-  somewhat odd FTP check in parse_remote_port() and instead converted it
-  to a better and more generic 'slash_removed' struct field. Checking the
-  ->protocol field isn't right since when an FTP:// URL is sent over a
-  HTTP proxy, the protocol is HTTP but the URL was handled by the FTP code
-  and thus slash_removed is set TRUE for this case.

-- multi: avoid a malloc() when a transfer is complete
+- URL-parsing: consider ? a divider
+  
+  The URL parser got a little stricter as it now considers a ? to be a
+  host name divider so that the slightly sloppier URLs work too. The
+  problem that made me do this change was the reported problem with an URL
+  like: www.example.com?email=name@example.com This form of URL is not
+  really a legal URL (due to the missing slash after the host name) but is
+  widely accepted by all major browsers and libcurl also already accepted
+  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
+  
+  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the
+  ?  letter as part of user-name or password when given in the URL, which
+  it used to accept (and is tested in test 191). That letter is however
+  mentioned in RFC3986 to be required to be percent encoded since it is
+  used as a divider.
   
-  The struct used for storing the message for a completed transfer is now
-  no longer allocated separatly but is kept within the main struct kept
-  for each easy handle so that we avoid one malloc (and the subsequent
-  free).

+- SFTP: more ignoring negative file sizes
+  
+  As the change in 5f0ae7a0626cbe709 added a precaution against negative
+  file sizes that for some reason managed to get returned, this change now
+  introduces the same check at the second place in the code where the file
+  size from the libssh2 stat call is used.
   
-  lib/Makefile.Watcom works fine already, for src/Makefile.Watcom we
-  need first to tweak src/Makefile.inc a bit - therefore the handtweaked
-  list still exists for now.
+  This check might not be suitable for a 32 bit curl_off_t, but libssh2.h
+  assumes long long to work and to be 64 bit so I believe such a small
+  curl_off_t will be very unlikely to occur in the wild.
 
-- Watcom makefiles overhaul.
+- SMTP: debug output for no known auth mechanisms supported
   
-  - make both libcurl and curl makefiles use register calling convention
-    (previously libcurl had stack calling convention).

-    to set the environment vars for this.
-  - added -wcd=201 to supress compiler warning about unreachable code.
-  - use macros for all tools, and removed dependency on GNU tools like rm.
-  - make ipv6 and debug builds controlable via env vars and so make them
-    optional instead of default.
-  - commented WINLDAPAPI and WINBERAPI since they broke with OW 1.8, and
-    it seems they're not needed (anymore?).
-  - added rule for hugehelp.c.cvs so that it will be created when not
-    already exist - this is required for building from a release tarball
-    since there we have no hugehelp.c.cvs, thus compilation broke.
-  - removed C_ARG creation from lib/Makefile.Watcom and use CFLAGS
-    directly as done too in src/Makefile.Watcom - this has the benefit
-    that we will see all active cflags and defines during compile.

-  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=file.txt; modification-date=...
+  We forgot to release the buffer passed to gss_init_sec_context.
   
-  This fix chops the filename off at the next semicolon, if there is one.
+  The previous logic was difficult to read as we were reusing the same
+  variable (gssbuf) for both input buffer and output buffer. Splitted the
+  logic in 2 variables to better underline who needs to be released.
+  Also made the code break at 80 lines.
 
-- --retry: access violation with URL part sets continued
-  
-  When getting multiple URLs, curl didn't properly reset the byte counter
-  after a successful transfer so if the subsequent transfer failed it
-  would wrongly use the previous byte counter and behave badly (segfault)
-  because of that. The code assumes that the byte counter and the 'stream'
-  pointer is well in synch.

-  multi: fix condition that remove timers before trigger
+  This fixes a memory leak related to the GSS-API code.
   
-  curl_multi perform has two phases: run through every easy handle calling
-  multi_runsingle and remove expired timers (timer removal).
+  Added a krb5_init and krb5_end functions. Also removed a work-around
+  the lack of proper initialization of the GSS-API context.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Oct 2010)
+- HTTP: remove special case for 416
   
-  If a small timer (e.g. 1-10ms) is set during multi_runsingle, then it's
-  possible that the timer has passed by when the timer removal runs. The
-  timer which was just added is then removed. This will potentially cause
-  the timer list to be empty and cause the next call to curl_multi_timeout
-  to return -1. Ideally, curl_multi_timeout should return 0 in this case.
+  It was pointed out that the special case libcurl did for 416 was
+  incorrect and wrong. 416 is not really different to other errors so the
+  response body must be handled like for other errors/http responses.
   
-  One way to fix this is to move the struct timeval now = Curl_tvnow(); to
-  the top of curl_multi_perform. The change does that.

-- configure: allow environments variable to override internals
-  
-  configure checks for grep, egrep, sed and ar and set the variables GREP,

-  
-  The test would loop forever if authtype bit 0 wasn't set.
+- TODO-RELEASE: move new features to next release
 
-- upload: warn users trying to upload from stdin with anyauth
-  
-  Since uploading from stdin is very likely to not work with anyauth and
-  its multi-phase probing for what authentication to actually use, alert
-  the user about it. Multi-phase negotiate almost certainly will involve
-  sending data and thus libcurl will need to rewind the stream to send
-  again, and it cannot do that with stdin.
+- README.ares: we know require c-ares 1.6.0
 
-- http: don't enable chunked during authentication negotiations
+- SFTP: avoid downloading negative sizes!
   
-  As mentioned in bug report #2956968, the HTTP code wouldn't send the
-  first empty chunk during the auth negotiation phase of the HTTP request
-  sending, so the server would wait for data to come and libcurl would
-  wait for data to arrive... I've made the code not enable chunked
-  encoding until the auth negotiation is done and thus this scenario
-  doesn't occur anymore.
+  It is still not clarified exactly why this happens, but libssh2
+  sometimes report a negative file size for the remote SFTP file and that
+  deeply confuses libcurl (or crashes it) so this precaution is added to
+  avoid badness.

-- --libcurl: use *_LARGE options with typecasted constants
+  all multi and hiper examples:

-- multi: CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET doesn't work after remove_handle
+  * don't loop curl_multi_perform calls, that was <7.20.0 style, currently
+    the exported multi functions will not return CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
   
-  When curl_multi_remove_handle() is called and an easy handle is returned
-  to the connection cache held in the multi handle, then we cannot allow
-  CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to extract it since that will more or less encourage
-  that the user uses the socket while it can get used by libcurl again.
+  all hiper examples:
+  * renamed check_run_count to check_multi_info
+  * don't  compare current running handle count with previous value, this
+    was the wrong way to check for finished requests, simply call
+    curl_multi_info_read
+  * it's also safe to call curl_multi_remove_handle inside the
+    curl_multi_info_read loop.
   
-  Without this fix, we'd get a segfault in Curl_getconnectinfo() trying to
-  dereference the NULL pointer in 'data->state.connc'.

+  * replaced curl_multi_socket (that function is marked as obsolete) calls

-- http_ntlm: add support for NSS
+Julien Chaffraix (28 Sep 2010)
+- krb5-gssapi: Remove several memory leaks.
   
-  When configured with '--without-ssl --with-nss', NTLM authentication
-  now uses NSS crypto library for MD5 and DES.  For MD4 we have a local
-  implementation in that case.  More details are available at
-  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/603783
+  Remove a leak seen on Kerberos/MIT (gss_OID is copied internally and
+  we were leaking it). Now we just pass NULL as advised in RFC2744.
   
-  In order to get it working, curl_global_init() must be called with
-  CURL_GLOBAL_SSL or CURL_GLOBAL_ALL.  That's necessary because NSS needs
-  to be initialized globally and we do so only when the NSS library is
-  actually required by protocol.  The mentioned call of curl_global_init()
-  is responsible for creating of the initialization mutex.
+  |tmp| was never set back to buf->data.
   
-  There was also slightly changed the NSS initialization scenario, in
-  particular, loading of the NSS PEM module.  It used to be loaded always
-  right after the NSS library was initialized.  Now the library is
-  initialized as soon as any SSL or NTLM is required, while the PEM module
-  is prevented from being loaded until the SSL is actually required.
+  Cleaned up Curl_sec_end to take into account failure in Curl_sec_login
+  (where conn->mech would be NULL but not conn->app_data or
+  conn->in_buffer->data).

-- glob: backslash escaping bug
+- security.c: Remove Curl_sec_fflush_fd.

-- multi_socket: re-use of same socket without notifying app
+Daniel Stenberg (28 Sep 2010)
+- curl_easy_escape: don't escape "unreserved" characters
   
-  When a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses and the first one
-  tried doesn't work, the socket for the second attempt may get dropped on
-  the floor, causing the request to eventually time out. The issue is that
-  when using kqueue (as on mac and bsd platforms) instead of select, the
-  kernel removes the first fd from kqueue when it is closed (in trynextip,
-  connect.c:503). Trynextip() then goes on to open a new socket, which
-  gets assigned the same number as the one it just closed. Later in
-  multi.c, socket_cb is not called because the fd is already in
-  multi->sockhash, so the new socket is never added to kqueue.
+  According to RFC3986 section 2.3 the letters -, ., _ and ~ should not be
+  percent-encoded.
   
-  The correct fix is to ensure that socket_cb is called to remove the fd
-  when trynextip() closes the socket, and again to re-add it after
-  singleipsocket(). I'm not sure how to cleanly do that, but the attached
-  patch works around the problem in an admittedly kludgy way by delaying
-  the close to ensure that the newly-opened socket gets a different fd.

+- multi: don't expire timeouts at disonnect or done
   
-  Daniel's added comment: I didn't spot a way to easily do a nicer fix so
-  I've proceeded with Ben's patch.
+  The functions Curl_disconnect() and Curl_done() are both used within the
+  scope of a single request so they cannot be allowed to use
+  Curl_expire(... 0) to kill all timeouts as there are some timeouts that
+  are set before a request that are supposed to remain until the request
+  is done.

+1.1 There are still bugs
+
   Curl and libcurl have grown substantially since the beginning. At the time
-  of writing (July 2007), there are about 47000 lines of source code, and by
-  the time you read this it has probably grown even more.
+  of writing (September 2011), there are about 66000 lines of source code, and
+  by the time you read this it has probably grown even more.
 
   Of course there are lots of bugs left. And lots of misfeatures.
 
   To help us make curl the stable and solid product we want it to be, we need
   bug reports and bug fixes.
 
-WHERE TO REPORT
+1.2 Where to report
 
   If you can't fix a bug yourself and submit a fix for it, try to report an as
   detailed report as possible to a curl mailing list to allow one of us to
-  have a go at a solution. You should also post your bug/problem at curl's bug

+  have a go at a solution. You can optionally also post your bug/problem at
+  curl's bug tracking system over at
 
         http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=976
 
   (but please read the sections below first before doing that)
 
   If you feel you need to ask around first, find a suitable mailing list and
   post there. The lists are available on http://curl.haxx.se/mail/
 
-WHAT TO REPORT
+1.3 What to report
 
   When reporting a bug, you should include all information that will help us
   understand what's wrong, what you expected to happen and how to repeat the
   bad behavior. You therefore need to tell us:
 
-   - your operating system's name and version number (uname -a under a unix
-     is fine)
+   - your operating system's name and version number
+
    - what version of curl you're using (curl -V is fine)
+
    - versions of the used libraries that libcurl is built to use
+
    - what URL you were working with (if possible), at least which protocol
 
   and anything and everything else you think matters. Tell us what you
   expected to happen, tell use what did happen, tell us how you could make it
   work another way. Dig around, try out, test. Then include all the tiny bits
   and pieces in your report. You will benefit from this yourself, as it will

   trace and send that (much smaller) output to us instead!
 
   The address and how to subscribe to the mailing lists are detailed in the

-HOW TO GET A STACK TRACE
+1.4 libcurl problems
+
+  First, post all libcurl problems on the curl-library mailing list.
+
+  When you've written your own application with libcurl to perform transfers,
+  it is even more important to be specific and detailed when reporting bugs.
+
+  Tell us the libcurl version and your operating system. Tell us the name and
+  version of all relevant sub-components like for example the SSL library
+  you're using and what name resolving your libcurl uses. If you use SFTP or
+  SCP, the libssh2 version is relevant etc.
+
+  Showing us a real source code example repeating your problem is the best way
+  to get our attention and it will greatly increase our chances to understand
+  your problem and to work on a fix (if we agree it truly is a problem).
+
+  Lots of problems that appear to be libcurl problems are actually just abuses
+  of the libcurl API or other malfunctions in your applications. It is adviced
+  that you run your problematic program using a memory debug tool like
+  valgrind or similar before you post memory-related or "crashing" problems to
+  us.
+
+1.5 Who will fix the problems
+
+  If the problems or bugs you describe are considered to be bugs, we want to
+  have the problems fixed.
+
+  There are no developers in the curl project that are paid to work on bugs.
+  All developers that take on reported bugs do this on a voluntary basis. We
+  do it out of an ambition to keep curl and libcurl excellent products and out
+  of pride.
+
+  But please do not assume that you can just lump over something to us and it
+  will then magically be fixed after some given time. Most often we need
+  feedback and help to understand what you've experienced and how to repeat a
+  problem. Then we may only be able to assist YOU to debug the problem and to
+  track down the proper fix.
+
+  We get reports from many people every month and each report can take a
+  considerable amount of time to really go to the bottom with.
+
+1.6 How to get a stack trace
 
   First, you must make sure that you compile all sources with -g and that you
   don't 'strip' the final executable. Try to avoid optimizing the code as
   well, remove -O, -O2 etc from the compiler options.
 
   Run the program until it cores.
@@ -76,6 +132,15 @@
 
   The list that is presented is the stack trace. If everything worked, it is
   supposed to contain the chain of functions that were called when curl
   crashed. Include the stack trace with your detailed bug report. It'll help a
   lot.
 
+1.7 Bugs in libcurl bindings
+
+  There will of course pop up bugs in libcurl bindings. You should then
+  primarily approach the team that works on that particular binding and see
+  what you can do to help them fix the problem.
+
+  If you suspect that the problem exists in the underlying libcurl, then
+  please convert your program over to plain C and follow the steps outlined
+  above.

+   Using BSD-style lwIP instead of Winsock TCP/IP stack in Win32 builds
+   --------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+   In order to compile libcurl and curl using BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack
+   it is necessary to make definition of preprocessor symbol USE_LWIPSOCK
+   visible to libcurl and curl compilation processes. To set this definition
+   you have the following alternatives:
+
+   - Modify lib/config-win32.h and src/config-win32.h
+   - Modify lib/Makefile.vc6
+   - Add definition to Project/Settings/C/C++/General/Preprocessor Definitions
+     in the vc6libcurl.dsw/vc6libcurl.dsp Visual C++ 6 IDE project.
+
+   Once that libcurl has been built with BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack support,
+   in order to use it with your program it is mandatory that your program
+   includes lwIP header file <lwip/opt.h> (or another lwIP header that includes
+   this) before including any libcurl header. Your program does not need the
+   USE_LWIPSOCK preprocessor definition which is for libcurl internals only.
+
+   Compilation has been verified with lwIP 1.4.0 and contrib-1.4.0 from:
+
+   http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lwip/lwip-1.4.0.zip
+   http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/lwip/contrib-1.4.0.zip
+
+   This BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack support must be considered experimental
+   given that it has been verified that lwIP 1.4.0 still needs some polish,
+   and libcurl might yet need some additional adjustment, caveat emptor.
+
    Important static libcurl usage note
    -----------------------------------
 
    When building an application that uses the static libcurl library, you must
    add '-DCURL_STATICLIB' to your CFLAGS.  Otherwise the linker will look for
    dynamic import symbols.

  Currently the SSH based code uses it a bit, but to remove PATH_MAX from there
  we need libssh2 to properly tell us when we pass in a too small buffer and
  its current API (as of libssh2 1.2.7) doesn't.
 
+1.6 progress callback without doubles
+
+ The progress callback was introduced way back in the days and the choice to
+ use doubles in the arguments was possibly good at the time. Today the doubles
+ only confuse users and make the amounts less precise. We should introduce

  HTTP Pipelining can be a way to greatly enhance performance for multiple
  serial requests and currently libcurl only supports that for HEAD and GET
  requests but it should also be possible for PUT.

 This release includes the following changes:
 
- o recognize the [protocol]:// prefix in proxy hosts where the protocol is one
-   of socks4, socks4a, socks5 or socks5h.
- o Added CURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETFUNCTION and CURLOPT_CLOSESOCKETDATA
+ o Added CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION
+ o Added support for NTLM delegation to Samba's winbind daemon helper ntlm_auth
+ o Display notes from setup file in testcurl.pl
+ o BSD-style lwIP TCP/IP stack experimental support on Windows
+ o OpenSSL: Use SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS if available
+ o --delegation was added to set CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION
+ o nss: start with no database if the selected database is broken
+ o telnet: allow programatic use on Windows
 
 This release includes the following bugfixes:
 
- o SECURITY ADVISORY: inappropriate GSSAPI delegation. Full details at
-   http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20110623.html
- o NTLM: work with unicode
- o fix connect with SOCKS proxy when using the multi interface
- o anyauthput.c: stdint.h must not be included unconditionally
- o CMake: improved build
- o SCP/SFTP enable non-blocking earlier
- o GnuTLS handshake: fix timeout
- o cyassl: build without filesystem
- o HTTPS over HTTP proxy using the multi interface
- o speedcheck: invalid timeout event on a reused handle
- o Force connection close for HTTP 200 OK when time condition matched
- o curl_formget: fix FILE * leak
- o configure: improved OpenSSL detection
- o Android build: support gingerbread
- o CURLFORM_STREAM: acknowledge CURLFORM_FILENAME
- o windows build: use correct MS CRT
- o pop3: remove extra space in LIST command
+ o curl_getdate: detect some illegal dates better
+ o when sending a request and an error is received before the (entire) request
+   body is sent, stop sending the request and close the connection after
+   having received the entire response. This is equally true if an Expect:
+   100-continue header was used.
+ o When using both -J and a single -O with multiple URLs, a missing init
+   could cause a segfault
+ o -J fixed for escaped quotes
+ o -J fixed for file names with semicolons
+ o progress: reset flags at transfer start to avoid wrong 
+   CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD
+ o curl_gssapi: Guard files with HAVE_GSSAPI and rename private header
+ o silence picky compilers: mark unused parameters
+ o help output: more gnu like output
+ o libtests: stop checking for CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
+ o setting a non-HTTP proxy with an environment variable or with CURLOPT_PROXY
+   / --proxy (without specifying CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE) would still make it do
+   proxy-like HTTP requests
+ o CURLFORM_BUFFER: insert filename as documented (regression)
+ o SOCKS: fix the connect timeout
+ o ftp_doing: bail out on error properly while multi interfacing
+ o improved Content-Encoded decoding error message
+ o asyn-thread: check for dotted addresses before thread starts
+ o cmake: find winsock when building on windows
+ o Curl_retry_request: check return code
+ o cookies: handle 'secure=' as if it was 'secure'
+ o tests: break busy loops in tests 502, 555, and 573
+ o FTP: fix proxy connect race condition with multi interface and SOCKS proxy
+ o RTSP: GET_PARAMETER requests have a body
+ o fixed several memory leaks in OOM situations
+ o bad expire(0) caused multi_socket API to hang
+ o Avoid ftruncate() static define with mingw64
+ o mk-ca-bundle.pl: ignore untrusted certs
+ o builds with PolarSSL 1.0.0
 
 This release includes the following known bugs:
 
  o see docs/KNOWN_BUGS (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/knownbugs.html)
