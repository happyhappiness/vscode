+- nss: fix MinGW compiler warnings
   
-  This reverts commit ecd1d020abdae3c3ce3643ddab3106501e62e7c0.
+  This fixes 3 warnings issued by MinGW:
+  1. PR_ImportTCPSocket actually has a paramter of type PROsfd instead of
+  PRInt32, which is 64 bits on Windows. Fixed this by including the
+  corresponding header file instead of redeclaring the function, which is
+  supported even though it is in the private include folder. [1]
+  2. In 64-bit mode, size_t is 64 bits while CK_ULONG is 32 bits, so an explicit
+  narrowing cast is needed.
+  3. Curl_timeleft returns time_t instead of long since commit
+  21aa32d30dbf319f2d336e0cb68d3a3235869fbb.
   
-  That commit caused test failures on my Debian Linux machine for all
-  changed test cases. We need to reconsider how that should get done.

-- tests: use consistent environment variables for setting charset
+  [1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSPR/Reference/PR_ImportTCPSocket
   
-  Character set in POSIX is set by the locale defined (in decreasing order
-  of precedence) by the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables (I
-  believe CHARSET is only historic). LC_ALL is cleared to ensure that
-  LC_CTYPE takes effect, but LC_ALL is not used to set the locale to
-  ensure that other parts of the locale aren't overriden, if set.  Since
-  there doesn't seem to be a cross-platform way of specifying a UTF-8
-  locale, and not all systems may support UTF-8, a <precheck> is used
-  (where relevant) to skip the test if UTF-8 isn't in use.  Test 1035 was
-  also converted to UTF-8 for consistency, as the actual character set
-  used there is irrelevant to the test.
+  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1393

-- url: Default the CA proxy bundle location to CURL_CA_BUNDLE
+Daniel Stenberg (18 Apr 2017)
+- [Jay Satiro brought this change]
+
+  TLS: Fix switching off SSL session id when client cert is used
   
-  If the compile-time CURL_CA_BUNDLE location is defined use it as the
-  default value for the proxy CA bundle location, which is the same as
-  what we already do for the regular CA bundle location.
+  Move the sessionid flag to ssl_primary_config so that ssl and proxy_ssl
+  will each have their own sessionid flag.
   
-  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1257
+  Regression since HTTPS-Proxy support was added in cb4e2be. Prior to that
+  this issue had been fixed in 247d890, CVE-2016-5419.

+  openssl: fix thread-safety bugs in error-handling
   
-  Closes #1280
+  ERR_error_string with NULL parameter is not thread-safe. The library
+  writes the string into some static buffer. Two threads doing this at
+  once may clobber each other and run into problems. Switch to
+  ERR_error_string_n which avoids this problem and is explicitly
+  bounds-checked.
+  
+  Also clean up some remnants of OpenSSL 0.9.5 around here. A number of
+  comments (fixed buffer size, explaining that ERR_error_string_n was
+  added in a particular version) date to when ossl_strerror tried to
+  support pre-ERR_error_string_n OpenSSLs.
+

-- tool_operate: Show HTTPS-Proxy options on CURLE_SSL_CACERT
-  
-  When CURLE_SSL_CACERT occurs the tool shows a lengthy error message to
-  the user explaining possible solutions such as --cacert and --insecure.
+  multi: fix queueing of pending easy handles
   
-  This change appends to that message similar options --proxy-cacert and
-  --proxy-insecure when there's a specified HTTPS proxy.
+  Multi handles repeatedly invert the queue of pending easy handles when
+  used with CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS. This is caused by a multistep
+  process involving Curl_splaygetbest and violates the FIFO property of
+  the multi handle.
+  This patch fixes this issue by redefining the "best" node in the
+  context of timeouts as the "smallest not larger than now", and
+  implementing the necessary data structure modifications to do this
+  effectively, namely:

+- http: do not treat FTPS over CONNECT as HTTPS
   
-  HTTPS proxy support was added in 7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.
+  If we use FTPS over CONNECT, the TLS handshake for the FTPS control
+  connection needs to be initiated in the SENDPROTOCONNECT state, not
+  the WAITPROXYCONNECT state.  Otherwise, if the TLS handshake completed
+  without blocking, the information about the completed TLS handshake
+  would be saved to a wrong flag.  Consequently, the TLS handshake would
+  be initiated in the SENDPROTOCONNECT state once again on the same
+  connection, resulting in a failure of the TLS handshake.  I was able to
+  observe the failure with the NSS backend if curl ran through valgrind.

-  cmake: Support curl --xattr when built with cmake
+  http: Fix proxy connection reuse with basic-auth
   
-  - Test for and set HAVE_FSETXATTR when support for extended file
-    attributes is present.
+  When using basic-auth, connections and proxy connections
+  can be re-used with different Authorization headers since
+  it does not authenticate the connection (like NTLM does).
+  
+  For instance, the below command should re-use the proxy
+  connection, but it currently doesn't:
+  curl -v -U alice:a -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
+    --next -U bob:b -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
+  
+  This is a regression since refactoring of ConnectionExists()
+  as part of: cb4e2be7c6d42ca0780f8e0a747cecf9ba45f151
+  
+  Fix the above by removing the username and password compare
+  when re-using proxy connection at proxy_info_matches().
+  
+  However, this fix brings back another bug would make curl
+  to re-print the old proxy-authorization header of previous
+  proxy basic-auth connection because it wasn't cleared.
+  
+  For instance, in the below command the second request should
+  fail if the proxy requires authentication, but would succeed
+  after the above fix (and before aforementioned commit):
+  curl -v -U alice:a -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/
+    --next -x http://localhost:8181 http://localhost/

-  cmdline-opts/gen.pl: Open input files in CRLF mode
+- cmake: build manual pages (including curl.1)
   
-  On Windows it's possible to have input files with CRLF line endings and

-  results in generator output of mixed line endings of CR, LF and CRLF.
+  Also make Perl mandatory to allow building the docs.
   
-  This change fixes that issue in the most succinct way by opening the
-  files in :crlf text mode even when the perl being used does not default
-  to that mode. (On operating systems that don't have a separate text mode
-  it's essentially a no-op.) The output continues to be in the perl's
-  native line ending.
+  While CMakeLists.txt could probably read the list of manual pages from
+  Makefile.am, actually putting those in CMakeLists.txt is cleaner so that

-  When using multi, mbedtls handshake is in non blocking mode.  vtls must
-  set wait for read/write flags for the socket.
+  These tests use an HTTP proxy so require that curl be built with HTTP
+  support.
+
+- tests: strip more options from non-HTTP --libcurl tests

+  The CURLOPT_USERAGENT and CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS options are only set if HTTP
+  support is available, so ignore them in tests where HTTP is not

+    same as what we already do for CURLOPT_CAPATH.
   
-  Fixes a few issues in manual wildcard cert name validation in
-  schannel support code for Win32 CE:
-  - when comparing the wildcard name to the hostname, the wildcard
-    character was removed from the cert name and the hostname
-    was checked to see if it ended with the modified cert name.
-    This allowed cert names like *.com to match the connection
-    hostname. This violates recommendations from RFC 6125.
-  - when the wildcard name in the certificate is longer than the
-    connection hostname, a buffer overread of the connection
-    hostname buffer would occur during the comparison of the
-    certificate name and the connection hostname.

-  proxy: Support HTTPS proxy and SOCKS+HTTP(s)
-  
-  * HTTPS proxies:
+Michael Kaufmann (28 Jan 2017)
+- mbedtls: disable TLS session tickets
   
-  An HTTPS proxy receives all transactions over an SSL/TLS connection.
-  Once a secure connection with the proxy is established, the user agent
-  uses the proxy as usual, including sending CONNECT requests to instruct
-  the proxy to establish a [usually secure] TCP tunnel with an origin
-  server. HTTPS proxies protect nearly all aspects of user-proxy
-  communications as opposed to HTTP proxies that receive all requests
-  (including CONNECT requests) in vulnerable clear text.
+  SSL session reuse with TLS session tickets is not supported yet.
+  Use SSL session IDs instead.
   
-  With HTTPS proxies, it is possible to have two concurrent _nested_
-  SSL/TLS sessions: the "outer" one between the user agent and the proxy
-  and the "inner" one between the user agent and the origin server
-  (through the proxy). This change adds supports for such nested sessions
-  as well.
+  See https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/1109
+
+- gnutls: disable TLS session tickets
   
-  A secure connection with a proxy requires its own set of the usual SSL
-  options (their actual descriptions differ and need polishing, see TODO):
+  SSL session reuse with TLS session tickets is not supported yet.
+  Use SSL session IDs instead.

+
+Daniel Stenberg (27 Jan 2017)
+- cookies: do not assume a valid domain has a dot
   
-  Curl now also supports %{proxy_ssl_verify_result} --write-out variable,
-  similar to the existing %{ssl_verify_result} variable.
+  This repairs cookies for localhost.
   
-  Supported backends: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and NSS.
+  Non-PSL builds will now only accept "localhost" without dots, while PSL
+  builds okeys everything not listed as PSL.
   
-  * A SOCKS proxy + HTTP/HTTPS proxy combination:
+  Added test 1258 to verify.
   
-  If both --socks* and --proxy options are given, Curl first connects to
-  the SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS
-  proxy.

-  Fix warnings about conversions from long to time_t in openssl.c and
-  schannel.c.
+  On Windows it's possible to have input files with CRLF line endings and
+  a perl that defaults to LF line endings (eg msysgit). Currently that
+  results in generator output of mixed line endings of CR, LF and CRLF.
   
-  Follow-up to de4de4e3c7c
+  This change fixes that issue in the most succinct way by opening the
+  files in :crlf text mode even when the perl being used does not default
+  to that mode. (On operating systems that don't have a separate text mode
+  it's essentially a no-op.) The output continues to be in the perl's
+  native line ending.

+  unix_socket: add support for abstract unix domain socket
   
-  Now Curl_rand() is made to fail if it cannot get the necessary random
-  level.
+  In addition to unix domain sockets, Linux also supports an
+  abstract namespace which is independent of the filesystem.
   
-  Changed the proto of Curl_rand() slightly to provide a number of ints at

+  In order to support it, add new CURLOPT_ABSTRACT_UNIX_SOCKET
+  option which uses the same storage as CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH
+  internally, along with a flag to specify abstract socket.
   
-  Moved out from vtls, since it isn't a TLS function and vtls provides
-  Curl_ssl_random() for this to use.
+  On non-supporting platforms, the abstract address will be
+  interpreted as an empty string and fail gracefully.

+  schannel: fix wildcard cert name validation on Win CE
   
-  bug: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102G.html
-  Reported-by: Luật Nguyễn
+  Fixes a few issues in manual wildcard cert name validation in
+  schannel support code for Win32 CE:
+  - when comparing the wildcard name to the hostname, the wildcard
+    character was removed from the cert name and the hostname
+    was checked to see if it ended with the modified cert name.
+    This allowed cert names like *.com to match the connection
+    hostname. This violates recommendations from RFC 6125.
+  - when the wildcard name in the certificate is longer than the
+    connection hostname, a buffer overread of the connection
+    hostname buffer would occur during the comparison of the
+    certificate name and the connection hostname.

+  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1153
+
+Dan Fandrich (2 Dec 2016)
+- test1281: added http as a required feature
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Dec 2016)
+- curl: support zero-length argument strings in config files
   
-  - Change timestamp to UTC.
+  ... like 'user-agent = ""'
   
-  - Change URL retrieval to HTTPS-only by default.
+  Adjusted test 71 to verify.
+
+- http_proxy: simplify CONNECT response reading
   
-  - Comment out the options that disabled SSL cert checking by default.
+  Since it now reads responses one byte a time, a loop could be removed
+  and it is no longer limited to get the whole response within 16K, it is
+  now instead only limited to 16K maximum header line lengths.
+
+- tests: fix CONNECT test cases to be more strict
   
-  - Assume OpenSSL is present, get SHA256. And add a flag to toggle it.
+  ... as they broke with the cleaned up CONNECT handling
+
+- CONNECT: read responses one byte at a time
   
-  - Fix cert issuer name output.
+  ... so that it doesn't read data that is actually coming from the
+  remote. 2xx responses have no body from the proxy, that data is from the
+  peer.
   
-  The cert issuer output is now ansi, converted from UTF-8. Prior to this
-  it was corrupt UTF-8. It turns out though we can work with UTF-8 the
-  FSO object that writes ca-bundle can't write UTF-8, so there will have
-  to be some alternative if UTF-8 is needed (like an ADODB.Stream).
+  Fixes #1132
+
+- CONNECT: reject TE or CL in 2xx responses
   
-  - Disable the certificate text info feature.
+  A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header
+  fields in a 2xx (Successful) response to CONNECT. (RFC 7231 section
+  4.3.6)
   
-  The certificate text info doesn't work properly with any recent OpenSSL.

-  
-  - Change all predefined Mozilla URLs to HTTPS (Gregory Szorc).
+Michael Kaufmann (30 Nov 2016)
+- CURLOPT_CONNECT_TO: Skip non-matching "connect-to" entries properly
   
-  - New option -k to allow URLs other than HTTPS and enable HTTP fallback.
+  If a port number in a "connect-to" entry does not match, skip this
+  entry instead of connecting to port 0.
   
-  Prior to this change the default URL retrieval mode was to fall back to
-  HTTP if HTTPS didn't work.
+  If a port number in a "connect-to" entry matches, use this entry
+  and look no further.

-
-- test557: verify printf() with 128 and 129 arguments
-
-- mprintf: return error on too many arguments
+  An HTTPS proxy receives all transactions over an SSL/TLS connection.
+  Once a secure connection with the proxy is established, the user agent
+  uses the proxy as usual, including sending CONNECT requests to instruct
+  the proxy to establish a [usually secure] TCP tunnel with an origin
+  server. HTTPS proxies protect nearly all aspects of user-proxy
+  communications as opposed to HTTP proxies that receive all requests
+  (including CONNECT requests) in vulnerable clear text.
   
-  128 arguments should be enough for everyone
-
-- ftp: fix Curl_ftpsendf()
+  With HTTPS proxies, it is possible to have two concurrent _nested_
+  SSL/TLS sessions: the "outer" one between the user agent and the proxy
+  and the "inner" one between the user agent and the origin server
+  (through the proxy). This change adds supports for such nested sessions
+  as well.
   
-  ... it no longer takes printf() arguments since it was only really taken
-  advantage by one user and it was not written and used in a safe
-  way. Thus the 'f' is removed from the function name and the proto is
-  changed.
+  A secure connection with a proxy requires its own set of the usual SSL
+  options (their actual descriptions differ and need polishing, see TODO):
   
-  Although the current code wouldn't end up in badness, it was a risk that
-  future changes could end up springf()ing too large data or passing in a
-  format string inadvertently.

-  The previous use of snprintf() could make libcurl silently truncate some
-  input data and not report that back on overly large input, which could
-  make data get sent over the network in a bad format.
+  All --proxy-foo options are independent from their --foo counterparts,
+  except --proxy-crlfile which defaults to --crlfile and --proxy-capath

+  similar to the existing %{ssl_verify_result} variable.

+- curl.1: typo

+- curl.1: expand on how multiple uses of -o looks
   
-  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
-  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
-  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
-  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
-  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
-  bursts" (as told in man page).
+  Suggested-by: Dan Jacobson
+  Issue: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/1097
+
+- tests/util: get a private strncasecompare clone
   
-  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
-  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
-  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
-  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
-  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
-  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
+  ... since the curlx_* code no longer provides one and we don't link
+  libcurl to these test servers.
+
+- strcase: make the tool use curl_str[n]equal instead
   
-  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
-  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
-  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
-  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
-  case of sudden speed burst).
+  As they are after all part of the public API. Saves space and reduces
+  complexity. Remove the strcase defines from the curlx_ family.

+- mk-ca-bundle: Update the vbscript version

+  Bring the VBScript version more in line with the perl version:
+  
+  - Change timestamp to UTC.
+  
+  - Change URL retrieval to HTTPS-only by default.
+  
+  - Comment out the options that disabled SSL cert checking by default.
+  
+  - Assume OpenSSL is present, get SHA256. And add a flag to toggle it.
+  
+  - Fix cert issuer name output.
+  
+  The cert issuer output is now ansi, converted from UTF-8. Prior to this
+  it was corrupt UTF-8. It turns out though we can work with UTF-8 the
+  FSO object that writes ca-bundle can't write UTF-8, so there will have
+  to be some alternative if UTF-8 is needed (like an ADODB.Stream).

+  - Disable the certificate text info feature.

-  ftp: fix wrong poll on the secondary socket
-  
-  When we're uploading using FTP and the server issues a tiny pause
-  between opening the connection to the client's secondary socket, the
-  client's initial poll() times out, which leads to second poll() which
-  does not wait for POLLIN on the secondary socket. So that poll() also
-  has to time out, creating a long (200ms) pause.
-  
-  This patch adds the correct flag to the secondary socket, making the
-  second poll() correctly wait for the connection there too.

+  This is a follow-up to e5f0b1a which had changed the behavior of
+  checking if pipelining is possible to ignore connections that had
+  'bits.close' set. Connections that have not yet reached the protocol

-  curl: allow "pkcs11:" prefix for client certificates
-  
-  RFC7512 provides a standard method to reference certificates in PKCS#11
-  tokens, by means of a URI starting 'pkcs11:'.
-  
-  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
-  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
-  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
-  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.
-  
-  This doesn't work with cURL because of the way that the colon is used
-  to separate the certificate argument from the passphrase. So instead of
+  curl: do not set CURLOPT_SSLENGINEDEFAULT automatically
   
-     curl -E 'pkcs11:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
+  There were bugs in the PKCS#11 engine, and fixing them triggers bugs in
+  OpenSSL. Just don't get involved; there's no need to be making the
+  engine methods the default anyway.
   
-  I instead need to invoke cURL with the colon escaped, like this:
+  https://github.com/OpenSC/libp11/pull/108
+  https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/1639
   
-     curl -E 'pkcs11\:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …

+- win: fix Universal Windows Platform build
   
-  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
-  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
-  differences for different applications.
+  This fixes a merge error in commit 7f3df80 caused by commit 332e8d6.
   
-  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
-  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
-  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
-  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
-  the URI itself.
+  Additionally, this changes Curl_verify_windows_version for Windows App
+  builds to assume to always be running on the target Windows version.
+  There seems to be no way to determine the Windows version from a
+  UWP app. Neither GetVersion(Ex), nor VerifyVersionInfo, nor the
+  Version Helper functions are supported.
   
-  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
-  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
-  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
-  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
+  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/820#issuecomment-250889878
+  Reported-by: Paul Joyce
   
-  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
-  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
-  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
-  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

+  No longer attempt to use "doomed" to-be-closed connections when

+  timeout) would be erroneously used, resulting in sporadic crashes.
   
-  This fixes tests that were added after 113f04e664b as the tests would
-  fail otherwise.
+  As originally reported and fixed by Carlo Wood (origin unknown).
   
-  We bring back "Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive" now unconditionally to fix

-  using it only for CONNECT or only for NTLM in a future if we want to
-  gradually reduce it.

-- proxy: reject attempts to use unsupported proxy schemes
-  
-  I discovered some people have been using "https://example.com" style
-  strings as proxy and it "works" (curl doesn't complain) because curl
-  ignores unknown schemes and then assumes plain HTTP instead.
+  resolve: add error message when resolving using SIGALRM
   
-  I think this misleads users into believing curl uses HTTPS to proxies
-  when it doesn't. Now curl rejects proxy strings using unsupported
-  schemes instead of just ignoring and defaulting to HTTP.

+  ... it no longer takes printf() arguments since it was only really taken

-- HTTP: retry failed HEAD requests too
+- formpost: avoid silent snprintf() truncation
   
-  Mark's new document about HTTP Retries
-  (https://mnot.github.io/I-D/httpbis-retry/) made me check our code and I
-  spotted that we don't retry failed HEAD requests which seems totally
-  inconsistent and I can't see any reason for that separate treatment.
+  The previous use of snprintf() could make libcurl silently truncate some
+  input data and not report that back on overly large input, which could
+  make data get sent over the network in a bad format.
   
-  So, no separate treatment for HEAD starting now. A HTTP request sent
-  over a reused connection that gets cut off before a single byte is
-  received will be retried on a fresh connection.
+  Example:
   
-  Made-aware-by: Mark Nottingham
+   $ curl --form 'a=b' -H "Content-Type: $(perl -e 'print "A"x4100')"

-  rtsp: accept any RTSP session id

-  Makes libcurl work in communication with gstreamer-based RTSP
-  servers. The original code validates the session id to be in accordance
-  with the RFC. I think it is better not to do that:
-  
-  - For curl the actual content is a don't care.

-- connect: disable TFO on Linux when using SSL
+- [Olivier Brunel brought this change]
+
+  speed caps: not based on average speeds anymore
   
-  - Linux TFO + TLS is not implemented yet.
+  Speed limits (from CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE &
+  CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE) were applied simply by comparing limits
+  with the cumulative average speed of the entire transfer; While this
+  might work at times with good/constant connections, in other cases it
+  can result to the limits simply being "ignored" for more than "short
+  bursts" (as told in man page).
   
-  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/907
+  Consider a download that goes on much slower than the limit for some
+  time (because bandwidth is used elsewhere, server is slow, whatever the
+  reason), then once things get better, curl would simply ignore the limit
+  up until the average speed (since the beginning of the transfer) reached
+  the limit.  This could prove the limit useless to effectively avoid
+  using the entire bandwidth (at least for quite some time).
+  
+  So instead, we now use a "moving starting point" as reference, and every
+  time at least as much as the limit as been transferred, we can reset
+  this starting point to the current position. This gets a good limiting
+  effect that applies to the "current speed" with instant reactivity (in
+  case of sudden speed burst).
+  
+  Closes #971

-  The HTTP/2 tests brought with commit bf05606ef1f were using the internal
-  name 'http2' for the HTTP/2 server, while in fact that name was already
-  used for the second instance of the HTTP server. This made tests using
-  the second instance (like test 2050) fail after a HTTP/2 test had run.
+  With commit c2f9b78 we added a new dependency on pkg-config for
+  developers which may be unwanted. This change make the configure script
+  still work as before if pkg-config isn't installed, it'll just use the
+  old zlib detection logic without pkg-config.
   
-  The server is now known as HTTP/2 internally and within the <server>
-  section in test cases. 1700, 1701 and 1702 were updated accordingly.

-- http: Fix HTTP/2 connection reuse
+  curl: allow "pkcs11:" prefix for client certificates
   
-  - Change the parser to not require a minor version for HTTP/2.
+  RFC7512 provides a standard method to reference certificates in PKCS#11
+  tokens, by means of a URI starting 'pkcs11:'.
   
-  HTTP/2 connection reuse broke when we changed from HTTP/2.0 to HTTP/2
-  in 8243a95 because the parser still expected a minor version.
+  We're working on fixing various applications so that whenever they would
+  have been able to use certificates from a file, users can simply insert
+  a PKCS#11 URI instead and expect it to work. This expectation is now a
+  part of the Fedora packaging guidelines, for example.

-- tool_urlglob: fix off-by-one error in glob_parse()

-  ... causing SIGSEGV while parsing URL with too many globs.
-  Minimal example:
+     curl -E 'pkcs11\:manufacturer=piv_II;id=%01' …
   
-  $ curl $(for i in $(seq 101); do printf '{a}'; done)
+  This is suboptimal because we want *consistency* — the URI should be
+  usable in place of a filename anywhere, without having strange
+  differences for different applications.
   
-  Reported-by: Romain Coltel
-  Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1340757
+  This patch therefore disables the processing in parse_cert_parameter()
+  when the string starts with 'pkcs11:'. It means you can't pass a
+  passphrase with an unescaped PKCS#11 URI, but there's no need to do so
+  because RFC7512 allows a PIN to be given as a 'pin-value' attribute in
+  the URI itself.
+  
+  Also, if users are already using RFC7512 URIs with the colon escaped as
+  in the above example — even providing a passphrase for cURL to handling
+  instead of using a pin-value attribute, that will continue to work
+  because their string will start 'pkcs11\:' and won't match the check.
+  
+  What *does* break with this patch is the extremely unlikely case that a
+  user has a file which is in the local directory and literally named
+  just "pkcs11", and they have a passphrase on it. If that ever happened,
+  the user would need to refer to it as './pkcs11:<passphrase>' instead.

-  vtls: fix ssl session cache race condition

+  regressions with old and stupid proxies, but we could possibly switch to
+  using it only for CONNECT or only for NTLM in a future if we want to
+  gradually reduce it.
   
-  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
-  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
-  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
-  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
-  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
-  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
-  This commit:
-   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
-     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
-   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
-     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
-   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
-     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
-     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
-     this race.

+  I discovered some people have been using "https://example.com" style

+  
+  I think this misleads users into believing curl uses HTTPS to proxies

-- curlbuild.h.dist: check __LP64__ as well to fix MIPS build
+  After a few wasted hours hunting down the reason for slowness during a

-  The preprocessor check that sets up the 32bit defines for non-configure
-  builds didn't work properly for MIPS systems as __mips__ is defined for
-  both 32bit and 64bit. Now __LP64__ is also checked and indicates 64bit.

-  http2: Add space between colon and header value
-  
-  curl's representation of HTTP/2 responses involves transforming the
-  response to a format that is similar to HTTP/1.1. Prior to this change,
-  curl would do this by separating header names and values with only a
-  colon, without introducing a space after the colon.
+- include: revert 9adf3c4 and make public types void * again
   
-  While this is technically a valid way to represent a HTTP/1.1 header
-  block, it is much more common to see a space following the colon. This
-  change introduces that space, to ensure that incautious tools are safely
-  able to parse the header block.
+  Many applications assume the actual contents of the public types and use
+  that do for example forward declarations (saving them from including our
+  public header) which then breaks when we switch from void * to a struct
+  *.
   
-  This also ensures that the difference between the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
-  response layout is as minimal as possible.
+  I'm not convinced we were wrong, but since this practise seems
+  widespread enough I'm willing to (partly) step down.
   
-  Bug: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/797
+  Now libcurl uses the struct itself when it is built and it allows
+  applications to use the struct type if CURL_STRICTER is defined at the
+  time of the #include.

-  TLS: SSL_peek is not a const operation
-  
-  Calling SSL_peek can cause bytes to be read from the raw socket which in
-  turn can upset the select machinery that determines whether there's data
-  available on the socket.
+- Revert "travis: Install libtool for OS X builds"
   
-  Since Curl_ossl_check_cxn only tries to determine whether the socket is

-  the wrong function to call.
+  Didn't work.
   
-  We're able to occasionally reproduce a connect timeout due to this

-  after the peek happens since data is buffered in the SSL buffer and thus

-  `eval "ac_cv_func_$func=yes"` can still cause problems as it works in

-  would be best to rewrite this test to use a new CURL_CHECK_FUNCS macro,

-- scripts/make: use $(EXEEXT) for executables
+  vtls: fix ssl session cache race condition
   
-  Reported-by: bodop
+  Sessionid cache management is inseparable from managing individual
+  session lifetimes. E.g. for reference-counted sessions (like those in
+  SChannel and OpenSSL engines) every session addition and removal
+  should be accompanied with refcount increment and decrement
+  respectively. Failing to do so synchronously leads to a race condition
+  that causes symptoms like use-after-free and memory corruption.
+  This commit:
+   - makes existing session cache locking explicit, thus allowing
+     individual engines to manage lock's scope.
+   - fixes OpenSSL and SChannel engines by putting refcount management
+     inside this lock's scope in relevant places.
+   - adds these explicit locking calls to other engines that use
+     sessionid cache to accommodate for this change. Note, however,
+     that it is unknown whether any of these engines could also have
+     this race.

-  http2: Ensure that http2_handle_stream_close is called
+  http: add CURLINFO_HTTP_VERSION and %{http_version}
   
-  This commit ensures that streams which was closed in on_stream_close
-  callback gets passed to http2_handle_stream_close.  Previously, this
-  might not happen.  To achieve this, we increment drain property to
-  forcibly call recv function for that stream.
-  
-  To more accurately check that we have no pending event before shutting
-  down HTTP/2 session, we sum up drain property into
-  http_conn.drain_total.  We only shutdown session if that value is 0.
-  
-  With this commit, when stream was closed before reading response
-  header fields, error code CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM is returned even if
-  HTTP/2 level error is NO_ERROR.  This signals the upper layer that
-  stream was closed by error just like TCP connection close in HTTP/1.
+  Adds access to the effectively used http version to both libcurl and
+  curl.

-  http2: Add handling stream level error
-  
-  Previously, when a stream was closed with other than NGHTTP2_NO_ERROR

-  undesirable since there may be other streams multiplexed and they are
-  very much fine.  This change introduce new error code
-  CURLE_HTTP2_STREAM, which indicates stream error that only affects the
-  relevant stream, and connection should be kept open.  The existing
-  CURLE_HTTP2 means connection error in general.

+1.8 Bugs in old versions
+
+  The curl project typically releases new versions every other month, and we

+  old versions when chances are we already fixed them or at least that they've
+  changed nature and appearance in later versions.
+
+  When you experience a problem and want to report it, you really SHOULD
+  include the version number of the curl you're using when you experience the
+  issue. If that version number shows us that you're using an out-of-date
+  curl, you should also try out a modern curl version to see if the problem
+  persists or how/if it has changed in apperance.
+
+  Even if you cannot immediately upgrade your application/system to run the
+  latest curl version, you can most often at least run a test version or
+  experimental build or similar, to get this confirmed or not.
+
+  At times people insist that they cannot upgrade to a modern curl version,
+  but instead they "just want the bug fixed". That's fine, just don't count on
+  us spending many cycles on trying to identify which single commit, if that's
+  even possible, that at some point in the past fixed the problem you're now
+  experiencing.
+
+  Security wise, it is almost always a bad idea to lag behind the current curl
+  versions by a lot. We keeping discovering and reporting security problems

+Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.
 
 When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line, it will
 attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By default, it will ignore
 errors if there are more URLs given and the last URL's success will determine
 the error code curl returns. So early failures will be "hidden" by subsequent
 successful transfers.
 
-Using this option, curl will instead return an error on the first transfers
-that fails, independent on the amount of more URLs that are given on the

-This option will apply for all given URLs even if you use --next.
+This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of --next.

+is not global and is therefore contained by --next.

 When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line, it will

 the error code curl returns. So early failures will be "hidden" by subsequent
 successful transfers.

  field is too long in the cert, it'll just return an error and the field will
  be displayed blank.

- Test case 165 might fail on a system which has libidn present, but with an

 .SH DESCRIPTION
-This option only works for libcurl powered by OpenSSL or wolfSSL/CyaSSL. If
-libcurl was built against another SSL library this functionality is absent.
+This option only works for libcurl powered by OpenSSL, wolfSSL/CyaSSL or
+mbedTLS. If libcurl was built against another SSL library this functionality is
+absent.
 
 Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype
 shown above.
 
 This callback function gets called by libcurl just before the initialization
 of an SSL connection after having processed all other SSL related options to
 give a last chance to an application to modify the behaviour of the SSL
 initialization. The \fIssl_ctx\fP parameter is actually a pointer to the SSL
-library's \fISSL_CTX\fP. If an error is returned from the callback no attempt
-to establish a connection is made and the perform operation will return the
-callback's error code. Set the \fIuserptr\fP argument with the
+library's \fISSL_CTX\fP for OpenSSL or wolfSSL/CyaSSL, and a pointer to
+\fImbedtls_ssl_config\fP for mbedTLS. If an error is returned from the callback
+no attempt to establish a connection is made and the perform operation will
+return the callback's error code. Set the \fIuserptr\fP argument with the
 \fICURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA(3)\fP option.
 
 This function will get called on all new connections made to a server, during
-the SSL negotiation. The SSL_CTX pointer will be a new one every time.
+the SSL negotiation. The \fIssl_ctx\fP will point to a newly initialized object
+each time, but note the pointer may be the same as from a prior call.
 
 To use this properly, a non-trivial amount of knowledge of your SSL library is
 necessary. For example, you can use this function to call library-specific
 callbacks to add additional validation code for certificates, and even to
 change the actual URI of a HTTPS request.

 Schannel will run CRL checks on certificates unless peer verification is
 disabled. Secure Transport on iOS will run OCSP checks on certificates unless
 peer verification is disabled. Secure Transport on OS X will run either OCSP
 or CRL checks on certificates if those features are enabled, and this behavior
 can be adjusted in the preferences of Keychain Access.

+HTTPS proxy
+-----------
+
+Since version 7.52.0, curl can do HTTPS to the proxy separately from the
+connection to the server. This TLS connection is handled separately from the
+server connection so instead of `--insecure` and `--cacert` to control the
+certificate verification, you use `--proxy-insecure` and `--proxy-cacert`.
+With these options, you make sure that the TLS connection and the trust of the
+proxy can be kept totally separate from the TLS connection to the server.

   The script breaks on the first test that doesn't do OK. Use -a to prevent
   the script from aborting on the first error. Run the script with -v for more
