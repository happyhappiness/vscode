+Version 7.19.4 (3 March 2009)
+
+Daniel Stenberg (3 Mar 2009)
+- David Kierznowski notified us about a security flaw
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20090303.html also known as CVE-2009-0037) in
+  which previous libcurl versions (by design) can be tricked to access an
+  arbitrary local/different file instead of a remote one when
+  CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION is enabled. This flaw is now fixed in this release
+  together this the addition of two new setopt options for controlling this
+  new behavior:
+
+  o CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS controls what protocols libcurl is allowed to
+  follow to when CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION is enabled. By default, this option
+  excludes the FILE and SCP protocols and thus you nee to explicitly allow
+  them in your app if you really want that behavior.
+
+  o CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS controls what protocol(s) libcurl is allowed to fetch
+  using the primary URL option. This is useful if you want to allow a user or
+  other outsiders control what URL to pass to libcurl and yet not allow all
+  protocols libcurl may have been built to support.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (27 Feb 2009)
+- Senthil Raja Velu reported a problem when CURLOPT_INTERFACE and
+  CURLOPT_LOCALPORT were used together (the local port bind failed), and
+  Markus Koetter provided the fix!
+
+Daniel Stenberg (25 Feb 2009)
+- As Daniel Fandrich figured out, we must do the GnuTLS initing in the
+  curl_global_init() function to properly maintain the performing functions
+  thread-safe. We've previously (28 April 2007) moved the init to a later time
+  just to avoid it to fail very early when libgcrypt dislikes the situation,
+  but that move was bad and the fix should rather be in libgcrypt or
+  elsewhere.
+  
+Daniel Stenberg (24 Feb 2009)
+- Brian J. Murrell found out that Negotiate proxy authentication didn't work.
+  It happened because the code used the struct for server-based auth all the
+  time for both proxy and server auth which of course was wrong.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (23 Feb 2009)
+- After a bug reported by James Cheng I've made curl_easy_getinfo() for
+  CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD and CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_UPLOAD return
+  -1 if the sizes aren't know. Previously these returned 0, make it impossible
+  to detect the difference between actually zero and unknown.
+
+Yang Tse (23 Feb 2009)
+- Daniel Johnson provided a shell script that will perform all the steps needed
+  to build a Mac OS X fat ppc/i386 or ppc64/x86_64 libcurl.framework
+
+Daniel Stenberg (23 Feb 2009)
+- I renamed everything in the windows builds files that used the name 'curllib'
+  to the proper 'libcurl' as clearly this caused confusion.
+
+Yang Tse (20 Feb 2009)
+- Do not halt compilation when using VS2008 to build a Windows 2000 target.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Feb 2009)
+- Linus Nielsen Feltzing reported and helped me repeat and fix a problem with
+  FTP with the multi interface: when a transfer fails, like when aborted by a
+  write callback, the control connection was wrongly closed and thus not
+  re-used properly.
+
+  This change is also an attempt to cleanup the code somewhat in this area, as
+  now the FTP code attempts to keep (better) track on pending responses
+  necessary to get read in ftp_done().
+
+Daniel Stenberg (19 Feb 2009)
+- Patrik Thunstrom reported a problem and helped me repeat it. It turned out 
+  libcurl did a superfluous 1000ms wait when doing SFTP downloads!
+
+  We read data with libssh2 while doing the "DO" operation for SFTP and then
+  when we were about to start getting data for the actual file part, the
+  "TRANSFER" part, we waited for socket action (in 1000ms) before doing a
+  libssh2-read. But in this case libssh2 had already read and buffered the
+  data so we ended up always just waiting 1000ms before we get working on the
+  data!
+
+Patrick Monnerat (18 Feb 2009)
+- FTP downloads (i.e.: RETR) ending with code 550 now return error
+  CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_NOT_FOUND instead of CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (17 Feb 2009)
+- Kamil Dudka made NSS-powered builds compile and run again!
+
+- A second follow-up change by Andre Guibert de Bruet to fix a related memory
+  leak like that fixed on the 14th. When zlib returns failure, we need to
+  cleanup properly before returning error.
+
+- CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS can now be set to 2 in addition to 1 for
+  plain FTP connections, and it will then allow MKD to fail once and retry the
+  CWD afterwards. This is especially useful if you're doing many simultanoes
+  connections against the same server and they all have this option enabled,
+  as then CWD may first fail but then another connection does MKD before this
+  connection and thus MKD fails but trying CWD works! The numbers can
+  (should?) now be set with the convenience enums now called
+  CURLFTP_CREATE_DIR and CURLFTP_CREATE_DIR_RETRY.
+
+  Tests has proven that if you're making an application that uploads a set of
+  files to an ftp server, you will get a noticable gain in speed if you're
+  using multiple connections and this option will be then be very useful.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (14 Feb 2009)
+- Andre Guibert de Bruet found and fixed a memory leak in the content encoding
+  code, which could happen on libz errors.
+
+Daniel Fandrich (12 Feb 2009)
+- Added support for Digest and NTLM authentication using GnuTLS.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (11 Feb 2009)
+- CURLINFO_CONDITION_UNMET was added to allow an application to get to know if
+  the condition in the previous request was unmet. This is typically a time
+  condition set with CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION and was previously not possible to
+  reliably figure out. From bug report #2565128
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2565128) filed by Jocelyn Jaubert.
+
+Daniel Fandrich (4 Feb 2009)
+- Don't add the standard /usr/lib or /usr/include paths to LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS
+  (respectively) when --with-ssl=/usr is used (patch based on FreeBSD).
+
+- Added an explicit buffer limit check in msdosify() (patch based on FreeBSD).
+  This couldn't ever overflow in curl, but might if the code were used
+  elsewhere or under different conditions.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (3 Feb 2009)
+- Hidemoto Nakada provided a small fix that makes it possible to get the
+  CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD size from file:// "transfers" with
+  CURLOPT_NOBODY set true.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Feb 2009)
+- Patrick Scott found a rather large memory leak when using the multi
+  interface and setting CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS to something less than the number
+  of handles you add to the multi handle. All the connections that didn't fit
+  in the cache would not be properly disconnected nor freed!
+
+- Craig A West brought us: libcurl now defaults to do CONNECT with HTTP
+  version 1.1 instead of 1.0 like before. This change also introduces the new
+  proxy type for libcurl called 'CURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0' that then allows apps to
+  switch (back) to CONNECT 1.0 requests. The curl tool also got a --proxy1.0
+  option that works exactly like --proxy but sets CURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0.
+
+  I updated all test cases cases that use CONNECT and I tried to do some using
+  --proxy1.0 and some updated to do CONNECT 1.1 to get both versions run.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (31 Jan 2009)
+- When building with c-ares 1.6.1 (not yet released) or later and IPv6 support
+  enabled, we can now take advantage of its brand new AF_UNSPEC support in
+  ares_gethostbyname(). This makes test case 241 finally run fine for me with
+  this setup since it now parses the "::1 ip6-localhost" line fine in my
+  /etc/hosts file!
+
+Daniel Stenberg (30 Jan 2009)
+- Scott Cantor filed bug report #2550061
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2550061) mentioning that I failed to
+  properly make sure that the VC9 makefiles got included in the latest
+  release. I've now fixed the release script and verified it so next release
+  will hopefully include them properly!
+
+Daniel Fandrich (30 Jan 2009)
+- Fixed --disable-proxy for FTP and SOCKS. Thanks to Daniel Egger for
+  reporting.
+
+Yang Tse (29 Jan 2009)
+- Introduced curl_sspi.c and curl_sspi.h for the implementation of functions
+  Curl_sspi_global_init() and Curl_sspi_global_cleanup() which previously were
+  named Curl_ntlm_global_init() and Curl_ntlm_global_cleanup() in http_ntlm.c
+  Also adjusted socks_sspi.c to remove the link-time dependency on the Windows
+  SSPI library using it now in the same way as it was done in http_ntlm.c.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (28 Jan 2009)
+- Markus Moeller introduced two new options to libcurl:
+  CURLOPT_SOCKS5_GSSAPI_SERVICE and CURLOPT_SOCKS5_GSSAPI_NEC to allow libcurl
+  to do GSS-style authentication with SOCKS5 proxies. The curl tool got the
+  options called --socks5-gssapi-service and --socks5-gssapi-nec to enable
+  these.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (26 Jan 2009)
+- Chad Monroe provided the new CURLOPT_TFTP_BLKSIZE option that allows an app
+  to set desired block size to use for TFTP transfers instead of the default
+  512 bytes.
+
+- The "-no_ticket" option was introduced in Openssl0.9.8j. It's a flag to
+  disable "rfc4507bis session ticket support".  rfc4507bis was later turned
+  into the proper RFC5077 it seems: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077
+
+  The enabled extension concerns the session management. I wonder how often
+  libcurl stops a connection and then resumes a TLS session. also, sending the
+  session data is some overhead. .I suggest that you just use your proposed
+  patch (which explicitly disables TICKET).
+
+  If someone writes an application with libcurl and openssl who wants to
+  enable the feature, one can do this in the SSL callback.
+
+  Sharad Gupta brought this to my attention. Peter Sylvester helped me decide
+  on the proper action.
+
+- Alexey Borzov filed bug report #2535504
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2535504) pointing out that realms with
+  quoted quotation marks in HTTP Digest headers didn't work. I've now added 
+  test case 1095 that verifies my fix.
+
+- Craig A West brought CURLOPT_NOPROXY and the corresponding --noproxy option.
+  They basically offer the same thing the NO_PROXY environment variable only
+  offered previously: list a set of host names that shall not use the proxy
+  even if one is specified.
+
+Daniel Fandrich (20 Jan 2009)
+- Call setlocale() for libtest tests to test the effects of locale-induced
+  libc changes on libcurl.
+
+- Fixed a couple more locale-dependent toupper conversions, mainly for
+  clarity.  This does fix one problem that causes ;type=i FTP URLs
+  to fail in the Turkish locale when CURLOPT_PROXY_TRANSFER_MODE is
+  used (test case 561)
+
+- Added tests 561 and 1091 through 1094 to test various combinations
+  of ;type= and ;mode= URLs that could potentially fail in the Turkish
+  locale.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 Jan 2009)
+- Lisa Xu pointed out that the ssh.obj file was missing from the
+  lib/Makefile.vc6 file (and thus from the vc8 and vc9 ones too).
+
 Version 7.19.3 (19 January 2009)

 protocols to attempt to tunnel through the proxy instead of merely using it to
 do HTTP-like operations. The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy
 CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the
 remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to.

 (SSH) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your public key in this
 separate file.

+The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn. This option
+allows you to change it.

+Examples:

+sockd/proxy-name
+ --socks5 proxy-name \fI--socks5-gssapi-service\fP sockd/real-name   would use

+As part of the gssapi negotiation a protection mode is negotiated. The rfc1961

+implementation does not.  The option \fI--socks5-gssapi-nec\fP allows the
+unprotected exchange of the protection mode negotiation. (Added in 7.19.4).
 .IP "--stderr <file>"
 Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If the file name
 is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout. This option has no point when
 you're using a shell with decent redirecting capabilities.

 Set HTTP proxy to use. The parameter should be a char * to a zero terminated

 .IP CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL
 Set the parameter to 1 to make the library tunnel all operations through a
 given HTTP proxy. There is a big difference between using a proxy and to
 tunnel through it. If you don't know what this means, you probably don't want
 this tunneling option.
+.IP CURLOPT_SOCKS5_GSSAPI_SERVICE
+Pass a char * as parameter to a string holding the name of the service. The
+default service name for a SOCKS5 server is rcmd/server-fqdn. This option
