-- Revert "telnet.c: fix handling of 0 being returned from custom read function"
-  
-  This reverts commit 03fa576833643c67579ae216c4e7350fa9b5f2fe.
+- THANKS-filter: a few more alterations to squash
 
-- telnet.c: fix invalid use of custom read function if not being set
-  
-  obj_count can be 1 if the custom read function is set or the stdin
-  handle is a reference to a pipe. Since the pipe should be handled
-  using the PeekNamedPipe-check below, the custom read function should
-  only be used if it is actually enabled.
+- contrithanks.sh: helper script for maintaining THANKS
 
-- telnet.c: fix handling of 0 being returned from custom read function
+- http_done: close Negotiate connections when done
   
-  According to [1]: "Returning 0 will signal end-of-file to the library
-  and cause it to stop the current transfer."
-  This change makes the Windows telnet code handle this case accordingly.
+  When doing HTTP requests Negotiate authenticated, the entire connnection
+  may become authenticated and not just the specific HTTP request which is
+  otherwise how HTTP works, as Negotiate can basically use NTLM under the
+  hood. curl was not adhering to this fact but would assume that such
+  requests would also be authenticated per request.

-  ... by making sure the first request is completed before doing the
-  remainder.
+  If a URL is given with a zero-length host name, like in "http://:80" or
+  just ":80", `fix_hostname()` will index the host name pointer with a -1

-- connect: wait for IPv4 connection attempts
+- cookie: cookie parser out of boundary memory access
   
-  ... even if the last IPv6 connection attempt has failed.
+  The internal libcurl function called sanitize_cookie_path() that cleans
+  up the path element as given to it from a remote site or when read from
+  a file, did not properly validate the input. If given a path that
+  consisted of a single double-quote, libcurl would index a newly
+  allocated memory area with index -1 and assign a zero to it, thus
+  destroying heap memory it wasn't supposed to.

+  This fixes a build failure where openssl and libmetalink are used

+  which fixes the same sort of problem for NSS builds.

-  If the session is still used by active SSL/TLS connections, it
-  cannot be closed yet. Thus we mark the session as not being cached
-  any longer so that the reference counting mechanism in
-  Curl_schannel_shutdown is used to close and free the session.
+  - Get rid of this flood of warnings in Windows mingw build:
+  warning: missing terminating " character
   
-  Reported-by: Jean-Francois Durand
+  The warning is due to the carriage return. When msysgit checks out files
+  from the repo by default it converts the line endings to CRLF. Prior to
+  this change when mkhelp.pl processed the MANUAL and curl.1 in CRLF
+  format the trailing carriage returns caused unnecessary CR in the

+  - converts lots of Curl_safefree() calls to good old free()
+  - makes Curl_safefree() not check the pointer before free()

+  connect: Fix happy eyeballs logic for IPv4-only builds
   
-  Otherwise, the fixes in the previous commits would only be applicable
-  to IDN and SSPI based builds and not others such as OpenSSL with LDAP
-  enabled.
+  Bug: https://github.com/bagder/curl/pull/168
+  
+  (trynextip)
+  - Don't try the "other" protocol family unless IPv6 is available. In an
+  IPv4-only build the other family can only be IPv6 which is unavailable.
+  
+  This change essentially stops IPv4-only builds from attempting the
+  "happy eyeballs" secondary parallel connection that is supposed to be
+  used by the "other" address family.
+  
+  Prior to this change in IPv4-only builds that secondary parallel
+  connection attempt could be erroneously used by the same family (IPv4)
+  which caused a bug where every address after the first for a host could
+  be tried twice, often in parallel. This change fixes that bug. An
+  example of the bug is shown below.
+  
+  Assume MTEST resolves to 3 addresses 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 and 127.0.0.4:
+  
+  * STATE: INIT => CONNECT handle 0x64f4b0; line 1046 (connection #-5000)
+  * Rebuilt URL to: http://MTEST/
+  * Added connection 0. The cache now contains 1 members
+  * STATE: CONNECT => WAITRESOLVE handle 0x64f4b0; line 1083
+  (connection #0)
+  *   Trying 127.0.0.2...

-  ldap.c:98: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive
+  A signal handler for SIGALRM is installed in Curl_resolv_timeout. It is
+  configured to interrupt system calls and uses siglongjmp to return into
+  the function if alarm() goes off.
+  
+  The signal handler is installed before curl_jmpenv is initialized.
+  This means that an already installed alarm timer could trigger the
+  newly installed signal handler, leading to undefined behavior when it
+  accesses the uninitialized curl_jmpenv.
+  
+  Even if there is no previously installed alarm available, the code in
+  Curl_resolv_timeout itself installs an alarm before the environment is
+  fully set up. If the process is sent into suspend right after that, the
+  signal handler could be called too early as in previous scenario.
+  
+  To fix this, the signal handler should only be installed and the alarm
+  timer only be set after sigsetjmp has been called.

+  Visual Studio 2008 introduced support for the address space layout

-- IPV6: address scope != scope id
-  There was a confusion between these: this commit tries to disambiguate them.
-  - Scope can be computed from the address itself.
-  - Scope id is scope dependent: it is currently defined as 1-based local
-    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
-    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
-    addresses.
-  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
-  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
-  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
-  to bind to an interface.
-  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
-  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
-  the interface index.
+  Set CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS to include definitions needed to get

-  There was a mix of GlobCode, CURLcode and ints and they were mostly
-  passing around CURLcode errors. This change makes the functions use only
-  CURLcode and removes the GlobCode type completely.

-  Change CURLOPT_TIMEOUT doc to warn that if CURLOPT_TIMEOUT and
-  CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS are both set whichever one is set last is the one
-  that will be used.
+  Visual Studio 2005 and above defaults to disabling the startup banner
+  for the Compiler, Linker and MIDL tools (with /NOLOGO). As such there
+  is no need to explicitly set the SuppressStartupBanner directive, as
+  this is a leftover from the VC7 and VC7.1 projects being upgraded to
+  VC8 and above.

+Steve Holme (11 Feb 2015)
+- openssl: Use OPENSSL_IS_BORINGSSL for BoringSSL detection
   
-  Commit b13923f changed an snprintf() to use aprintf(), but the API usage
-  wasn't correct, and was causing a crash to occur. This fixes it.
+  For consistency with other conditionally compiled code in openssl.c,
+  use OPENSSL_IS_BORINGSSL rather than HAVE_BORINGSSL and try to use
+  HAVE_BORINGSSL outside of openssl.c when the OpenSSL header files are
+  not included.

+  timeval: typecast for better type (on Amiga)
   
-  ...and minor layout adjustment.
+  There is an issue with conflicting "struct timeval" definitions with
+  certain AmigaOS releases and C libraries, depending on what gets
+  included when.  It's a minor difference - the OS one is unsigned,
+  whereas the common structure has signed elements.  If the OS one ends up
+  getting defined, this causes a timing calculation error in curl.
+  
+  It's easy enough to resolve this at the curl end, by casting the
+  potentially errorneous calculation to a signed long.

-  libcurl: add UNIX domain sockets support
-  
-  The ability to do HTTP requests over a UNIX domain socket has been
-  requested before, in Apr 2008 [0][1] and Sep 2010 [2]. While a
-  discussion happened, no patch seems to get through. I decided to give it
-  a go since I need to test a nginx HTTP server which listens on a UNIX
-  domain socket.
-  
-  One patch [3] seems to make it possible to use the
-  CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION function to gain a UNIX domain socket.
-  Another person wrote a Go program which can do HTTP over a UNIX socket
-  for Docker[4] which uses a special URL scheme (though the name contains
-  cURL, it has no relation to the cURL library).
-  
-  This patch considers support for UNIX domain sockets at the same level
-  as HTTP proxies / IPv6, it acts as an intermediate socket provider and
-  not as a separate protocol. Since this feature affects network
-  operations, a new feature flag was added ("unix-sockets") with a
-  corresponding CURL_VERSION_UNIX_SOCKETS macro.
-  
-  A new CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH option is added and documented. This
-  option enables UNIX domain sockets support for all requests on the
-  handle (replacing IP sockets and skipping proxies).
+  curl.h: remove extra space
+
+- Curl_pretransfer: reset expected transfer sizes
   
-  A new configure option (--enable-unix-sockets) and CMake option
-  (ENABLE_UNIX_SOCKETS) can disable this optional feature. Note that I
-  deliberately did not mark this feature as advanced, this is a
-  feature/component that should easily be available.

-  
-  Commit curl-7_23_1-143-g8218064 changed the parameter of
-  responsive_http_server to accept types other than IPv6 (converting
-  from a boolean to a string), but only considered the lower-case "ipv6"
-  and not the "IPv6" variant. This caused all servers to start in IPv4

-  
-  This patch converts the remaining cases to "ipv6". While not strictly

+- openssl: warn for SRP set if SSLv3 is used, not for TLS version
   
-  When the connection code decides to close a socket it informs the multi

-  CURL_POLL_REMOVE. This happens after the socket has already been
-  closed. Reorder the code so that CURL_POLL_REMOVE is called before the
-  socket is closed.
+  ... as it requires TLS and it was was left to warn on the default from
+  when default was SSL...

-- config-win32: Fixed build targets for the VS2012+ Windows XP toolset
+- IPV6: address scope != scope id
+  There was a confusion between these: this commit tries to disambiguate them.
+  - Scope can be computed from the address itself.
+  - Scope id is scope dependent: it is currently defined as 1-based local
+    interface index for link-local scoped addresses, and as a site index(?) for
+    (obsolete) site-local addresses. Linux only supports it for link-local
+    addresses.
+  The URL parser properly parses a scope id as an interface index, but stores it
+  in a field named "scope": confusion. The field has been renamed into "scope_id".
+  Curl_if2ip() used the scope id as it was a scope. This caused failures
+  to bind to an interface.
+  Scope is now computed from the addresses and Curl_if2ip() matches them.
+  If redundantly specified in the URL, scope id is check for mismatch with
+  the interface index.
   
-  Even though commit 23e70e1cc6 mentioned the v110_xp toolset, I had
-  forgotten to include the relevant pre-processor definitions.
+  This commit should fix SF bug #1451.

-  cmake: add ENABLE_THREADED_RESOLVER, rename ARES
-  
-  Fix detection of the AsynchDNS feature which not just depends on
-  pthreads support, but also on whether USE_POSIX_THREADS is set or not.
-  Caught by test 1014.
+- smtp: Fixed dot stuffing when EOL characters were at end of input buffers
   
-  This patch adds a new ENABLE_THREADED_RESOLVER option (corresponding to
-  --enable-threaded-resolver of autotools) which also needs a check for
-  HAVE_PTHREAD_H.
+  Fixed a problem with the CRLF. detection when multiple buffers were
+  used to upload an email to libcurl and the line ending character(s)
+  appeared at the end of each buffer. This meant any lines which started
+  with . would not be escaped into .. and could be interpreted as the end
+  of transmission string instead.
   
-  For symmetry with autotools, CURL_USE_ARES is renamed to ENABLE_ARES
-  (--enable-ares). Checks that test for the availability actually use
-  USE_ARES instead as that is the result of whether a-res is available or
-  not (in practice this does not matter as CARES is marked as required
-  package, but nevertheless it is better to write the intent).
+  This only affected libcurl based applications that used a read function
+  and wasn't reproducible with the curl command-line tool.

+  libcurl: add UNIX domain sockets support
+  
+  The ability to do HTTP requests over a UNIX domain socket has been
+  requested before, in Apr 2008 [0][1] and Sep 2010 [2]. While a
+  discussion happened, no patch seems to get through. I decided to give it
+  a go since I need to test a nginx HTTP server which listens on a UNIX
+  domain socket.
   
-  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2014-11/0035.html
-  Reported-by: Jan Ehrhardt
-
-- strdup: Removed irrelevant comment
+  One patch [3] seems to make it possible to use the
+  CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION function to gain a UNIX domain socket.
+  Another person wrote a Go program which can do HTTP over a UNIX socket
+  for Docker[4] which uses a special URL scheme (though the name contains
+  cURL, it has no relation to the cURL library).
   
-  ...as Curl_memdup() duplicates an area of fix size memory, that may be
-  binary, and not a null terminated string.
-
-- url.c: Fixed compilation warning
+  This patch considers support for UNIX domain sockets at the same level
+  as HTTP proxies / IPv6, it acts as an intermediate socket provider and
+  not as a separate protocol. Since this feature affects network
+  operations, a new feature flag was added ("unix-sockets") with a
+  corresponding CURL_VERSION_UNIX_SOCKETS macro.
   
-  conversion from 'curl_off_t' to 'size_t', possible loss of data
-
-- http_digest: Use CURLcode instead of CURLdigest
+  A new CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH option is added and documented. This
+  option enables UNIX domain sockets support for all requests on the
+  handle (replacing IP sockets and skipping proxies).
   
-  To provide consistent behaviour between the various HTTP authentication
-  functions use CURLcode based error codes for Curl_input_digest()
-  especially as the calling code doesn't use the specific error code just
-  that it failed.
-
-Daniel Stenberg (5 Nov 2014)
-- contributors.sh: filter common alternative name spellings
+  A new configure option (--enable-unix-sockets) and CMake option
+  (ENABLE_UNIX_SOCKETS) can disable this optional feature. Note that I
+  deliberately did not mark this feature as advanced, this is a
+  feature/component that should easily be available.

-- curl_easy_duphandle: CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS read out of bounds
+  sws: add UNIX domain socket support
   
-  When duplicating a handle, the data to post was duplicated using
-  strdup() when it could be binary and contain zeroes and it was not even
-  zero terminated! This caused read out of bounds crashes/segfaults.
+  This extends sws with a --unix-socket option which causes the port to
+  be ignored (as the server now listens on the path specified by
+  --unix-socket). This feature will be available in the following patch
+  that enables checking for UNIX domain socket support.
   
-  Since the lib/strdup.c file no longer is easily shared with the curl
-  tool with this change, it now uses its own version instead.
+  Proxy support (CONNECT) is not considered nor tested. It does not make
+  sense anyway, first connecting through a TCP proxy, then let that TCP
+  proxy connect to a UNIX socket.

-  A left over from the VC6 project files, so mainly cosmetic in Visual
-  Studio .NET as it can handle both comma and semi-colon characters for
-  separating multiple pre-processor definitions.
+  If the scratch buffer already existed when the CRLF conversion was
+  performed then the buffer pointer would be checked twice for NULL. This
+  second check is only necessary if the call to malloc() was performed by
+  the first check.
+
+- smtp: Fixed dot stuffing being performed when no new data read
   
-  However, the IDE uses semi-colons if the value is edited, and as such,
-  this may cause problems in future for anyone updating the files or
-  merging patches.
+  Whilst I had moved the dot stuffing code from being performed before
+  CRLF conversion takes place to after it, in commit 4bd860a001, I had
+  moved it outside the 'when something read' block of code when meant
+  it could perform the dot stuffing twice on partial send if nread
+  happened to contain the right values. It also meant the function could
+  potentially read past the end of buffer. This was highlighted by the

-  I had previously disabled this functionality in commit 607883f13c as I
-  couldn't get this to work under Windows 8, however, from testing HTTP
-  Digest authentication through Windows SSPI and then further testing of

-  support smaller numbers but not larger. It does now, but we will not
-  make any specific promises nor document this further since it is going

-  cppcheck pointed these out.
+  USE_NTLM would only be defined if: HTTP support was enabled, NTLM and

+  library or Windows SSPI was being compiled against.
+  
+  This means it was not possible to build libcurl without HTTP support
+  and use NTLM for other protocols such as IMAP, POP3 and SMTP. Rather
+  than introduce a new SASL pre-processor definition, removed the HTTP

-  Cmake: Build with GSSAPI (MIT or Heimdal)
-  
-  It tries hard to recognise SDK's on different platforms. On windows MIT
-  Kerberos installs SDK with other things and puts path into registry.

+- curl_easy_duphandle: CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS read out of bounds
   
-  Coverity CID 1202836. If the proxy environment variable returned an empty

-
-- multi_runsingle: fix memory leak
+  When duplicating a handle, the data to post was duplicated using

-  ntlm: Fixed HTTP proxy authentication when using Windows SSPI
+  cmake: fix gethostby{addr,name}_r in CurlTests
   
-  Removed ISC_REQ_* flags from calls to InitializeSecurityContext to fix
-  bug in NTLM handshake for HTTP proxy authentication.
+  This patch cleans up the automatically-generated (?) code and fixes one
+  case that will always fail due to syntax error.
+  
+  HAVE_GETHOSTBYADDR_R_5_REENTRANT always failed because of a trailing
+  character ("int length;q"). Several parameter type and unused variable
+  warnings popped up. This causes a detection failure with -Werror.
   
-  NTLM handshake for HTTP proxy authentication failed with error
-  SEC_E_INVALID_TOKEN from InitializeSecurityContext for certain proxy
-  servers on generating the NTLM Type-3 message.
+  Observe that the REENTRANT cases are exactly the same as their
+  non-REENTRANT cases except for a `_REENTRANT` macro definition.
+  Merge all these pieces and build one big main function with different
+  cases, but reusing variables where logical.
   
-  The flag ISC_REQ_CONFIDENTIALITY seems to cause the problem according
-  to the observations and suggestions made in a bug report for the
-  QT project (https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-17322).

-  newlines: fix mixed newlines to LF-only
-  
-  I use the curl repo mainly on Windows with the typical Windows git
-  checkout which converts the LF line endings in the curl repo to CRLF
-  automatically on checkout. The automatic conversion is not done on files
-  in the repo with mixed line endings. I recently noticed some weird
-  output with projects/build-openssl.bat that I traced back to mixed line
-  endings, so I scanned the repo and there are files (excluding the
-  test data) that have mixed line endings.
+  cmake: drop _BSD_SOURCE macro usage
   
-  I used this command below to do the scan. Unfortunately it's not as easy
-  as git grep, at least not on Windows. This gets the names of all the
-  files in the repo's HEAD, gets each of those files raw from HEAD, checks
-  for mixed line endings of both LF and CRLF, and prints the name if
-  mixed. I excluded path tests/data/test* because those can have mixed
-  line endings if I understand correctly.
+  autotools does not use features.h nor _BSD_SOURCE. As this macro
+  triggers warnings since glibc 2.20, remove it. It should not have

-- mk-ca-bundle.pl: first, try downloading HTTPS with curl
+- build: Fixed the pre-processor separator in Visual Studio project files
   
-  As a sort of step forward, this script will now first try to get the

-  switch back to the HTTP transfer using perl's native LWP functionality.
-  To reduce the risk of this script being tricked.
+  A left over from the VC6 project files, so mainly cosmetic in Visual
+  Studio .NET as it can handle both comma and semi-colon characters for
+  separating multiple pre-processor definitions.
   
-  Using HTTPS to get a cert bundle introduces a chicken-and-egg problem so
-  we can't really ever completely disable HTTP, but chances are that most
-  users already have a ca cert bundle that trusts the mozilla.org site
-  that this script downloads from.
+  However, the IDE uses semi-colons if the value is edited, and as such,
+  this may cause problems in future for anyone updating the files or
+  merging patches.
   
-  A future version of this script will probably switch to require a
-  dedicated "insecure" command line option to allow downloading over HTTP
-  (or unverified HTTPS).

+- resume: consider a resume from [content-length] to be OK

-  Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize() are passed a "size" of -1 (which a few

-  lets update Curl_pgrsSetDownloadSize() and Curl_pgrsSetUploadSize()
-  so they make sure that these variables always contain a value that
-  is >= 0.
+  Basically since servers often then don't respond well to this and
+  instead send the full contents and then libcurl would instead error out
+  with the assumption that the server doesn't support resume. As the data
+  is then already transfered, this is now considered fine.

-  Fixed libcurl to correctly output the newer versions of OpenSSL 0.9.8,
-  starting from openssl-0.9.8za.
-
-- [Frank Meier brought this change]
+  CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS with a given CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE does not
+  require a trailing zero of the data and by making sure this test doesn't
+  use one we know it works (combined with valgrind).
 
-  create_conn: prune dead connections
-  
-  Bringing back the old functionality that was mistakenly removed when the
-  connection cache was remade. When creating a new connection, all the
-  existing ones are checked and those that are known to be dead get
-  disconnected for real and removed from the connection cache. It helps
-  the cache from holding on to very many stale connections and aids in
-  keeping down the number of system sockets in wait states.

-- http_negotiate_sspi: Use a dynamic buffer for SPN generation

-  Updated to use a dynamic buffer for the SPN generation via the recently

-  Updated Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() to use a dynamic buffer
-  for the SPN generation via the recently introduced Curl_sasl_build_spn()
-  function rather than a fixed buffer of 128 characters.
+- pinning: minor code style policing
 
-- sasl_sspi: Fixed SPN not being converted to wchar under Unicode builds
-  
-  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() would simply cast the SPN variable
-  to a TCHAR when calling InitializeSecurityContext(). This meant that,
-  under Unicode builds, it would not be valid wide character string.
-  
-  Updated to use the recently introduced Curl_sasl_build_spn() function
-  which performs the correct conversion for us.
+Patrick Monnerat (13 Oct 2014)
+- Factorize pinned public key code into generic file handling and backend specific
 
-- sasl: Introduced Curl_sasl_build_spn() for building a SPN
-  
-  Various parts of the libcurl source code build a SPN for inclusion in
-  authentication data. This information is either used by our own native
-  generation routines or passed to authentication functions in third-party
-  libraries such as SSPI. However, some of these instances use fixed
-  buffers rather than dynamically allocated ones and not all of those that
-  should, convert to wide character strings in Unicode builds.
-  
-  Implemented a common function that generates a SPN and performs the
-  wide character conversion where necessary.

-- ntlm: Fixed hard coded buffer for SSPI based auth packet generation
+  cmake: enable IPv6 by default if available
   
-  Given the SSPI package info query indicates a token size of 2888 bytes,
-  and as with the Winbind code and commit 9008f3d56, use a dynamic buffer
-  for the Type-1 and Type-3 message generation rather than a fixed buffer
-  of 1024 bytes.
-
-- ntlm: Added support for SSPI package info query
+  ENABLE_IPV6 depends on HAVE_GETADDRINFO or you will get a
+  Curl_getaddrinfo_ex error. Enable IPv6 by default, disabling it if
+  struct sockaddr_in6 is not found in netinet/in.h.
   
-  Just as with the SSPI implementations of Digest and Negotiate added a
-  package info query so that libcurl can a) return a more appropriate
-  error code when the NTLM package is not supported and b) it can be of
-  use later to allocate a dynamic buffer for the Type-1 and Type-3

-  OPENSSL_config() is "strongly recommended" to use but unfortunately that
-  function makes an exit() call on wrongly formatted config files which
-  makes it hard to use in some situations. OPENSSL_config() itself calls
-  CONF_modules_load_file() and we use that instead and we ignore its

  With git (and especially github) it is easy and tempting to send a pull
- request to one or more people in the curl project to have changes merged this
- way instead of mailing patches to the curl-library mailing list.
-
- We don't like that. We want them mailed for these reasons:
-
- - Peer review. Anyone and everyone on the list can review, comment and
-   improve on the patch. Pull requests limit this ability.
-
- - Anyone can merge the patch into their own trees for testing and those who
-   have push rights can push it to the main repo. It doesn't have to be anyone
-   the patch author knows beforehand.
-
- - Commit messages can be tweaked and changed if merged locally instead of
-   using github. Merges directly on github requires the changes to be perfect
-   already, which they seldom are.

+ We used to dislike this but we're trying to change that and accept that this
+ is a frictionless way for people to contribute to the project. We now welcome
+ pull requests!
 
- However: once patches have been reviewed and deemed fine on list they are
- perfectly OK to be pulled from a published git tree.
+ We will continue to avoid using github's merge tools to make the history
+ linear and to make sure commits follow our style guidelines.

   You can also use the -w option and the variable %{response_code} to extract
   the exact response code that was return in the response.
 
+  4.21 Why is there a HTTP/1.1 in my HTTP/2 request?
+
+  If you use verbose to see the HTTP request when you send off a HTTP/2
+  request, it will still say 1.1.
+
+  The reason for this is that we first generate the request to send using the
+  old 1.1 style and show that request in the verbose output, and then we
+  convert it over to the binary header-compressed HTTP/2 style. The actual
+  "1.1" part from that request is then not actually used in the transfer. The
+  binary HTTP/2 headers are not human readable.

   5.1 Is libcurl thread-safe?
 
   Yes.

 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">calendar date items</span> Can be specified several ways. Month names can only be three-letter english abbreviations, numbers can be zero-prefixed and the year may use 2 or 4 digits. Examples: 06 Nov 1994, 06-Nov-94 and Nov-94 6. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">time of the day items</span> This string specifies the time on a given day. You must specify it with 6 digits with two colons: HH:MM:SS. To not include the time in a date string, will make the function assume 00:00:00. Example: 18:19:21. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">time zone items</span> Specifies international time zone. There are a few acronyms supported, but in general you should instead use the specific relative time compared to UTC. Supported formats include: -1200, MST, +0100. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">day of the week items</span> Specifies a day of the week. Days of the week may be spelled out in full (using english): `Sunday', `Monday', etc or they may be abbreviated to their first three letters. This is usually not info that adds anything. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pure numbers</span> If a decimal number of the form YYYYMMDD appears, then YYYY is read as the year, MM as the month number and DD as the day of the month, for the specified calendar date.

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
 <p class="level0">This function extracts file descriptor information from a given multi_handle. libcurl returns its fd_set sets. The application can use these to select() on, but be sure to FD_ZERO them before calling this function as <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_fdset.html">curl_multi_fdset</a> only adds its own descriptors, it doesn't zero or otherwise remove any others. The <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform</a> function should be called as soon as one of them is ready to be read from or written to. 
 <p class="level0">If the <span Class="emphasis">read_fd_set</span> argument is not a null pointer, it points to an object of type fd_set that on returns specifies the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to read. 
 <p class="level0">If the <span Class="emphasis">write_fd_set</span> argument is not a null pointer, it points to an object of type fd_set that on return specifies the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to write. 
 <p class="level0">If the <span Class="emphasis">exc_fd_set</span> argument is not a null pointer, it points to an object of type fd_set that on return specifies the file descriptors to be checked for error conditions pending. 
 <p class="level0">If no file descriptors are set by libcurl, <span Class="emphasis">max_fd</span> will contain -1 when this function returns. Otherwise it will contain the highest descriptor number libcurl set. When libcurl returns -1 in <span Class="emphasis">max_fd</span>, it is because libcurl currently does something that isn't possible for your application to monitor with a socket and unfortunately you can then not know exactly when the current action is completed using select(). You then need to wait a while before you proceed and call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_perform.html">curl_multi_perform</a> anyway. How long to wait? We suggest 100 milliseconds at least, but you may want to test it out in your own particular conditions to find a suitable value.

 <p class="level0">When the application has detected action on a socket handled by libcurl, it should call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action</a> with the <span Class="bold">sockfd</span> argument set to the socket with the action. When the events on a socket are known, they can be passed as an events bitmask <span Class="bold">ev_bitmask</span> by first setting <span Class="bold">ev_bitmask</span> to 0, and then adding using bitwise OR (|) any combination of events to be chosen from CURL_CSELECT_IN, CURL_CSELECT_OUT or CURL_CSELECT_ERR. When the events on a socket are unknown, pass 0 instead, and libcurl will test the descriptor internally. It is also permissible to pass CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT to the <span Class="bold">sockfd</span> parameter in order to initiate the whole process or when a timeout occurs. 
 <p class="level0">At return, the integer <span Class="bold">running_handles</span> points to will contain the number of running easy handles within the multi handle. When this number reaches zero, all transfers are complete/done. When you call <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action</a> on a specific socket and the counter decreases by one, it DOES NOT necessarily mean that this exact socket/transfer is the one that completed. Use <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_info_read.html">curl_multi_info_read</a> to figure out which easy handle that completed. 
 <p class="level0">The <a Class="bold" href="./curl_multi_socket_action.html">curl_multi_socket_action</a> functions inform the application about updates in the socket (file descriptor) status by doing none, one, or multiple calls to the socket callback function set with the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION option to <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_multi_setopt.html">curl_multi_setopt</a>. They update the status with changes since the previous time the callback was called.

It will block until activity is detected on at least one of the handles or <span Class="emphasis">timeout_ms</span> has passed. Alternatively, if the multi handle has a pending internal timeout that has a shorter expiry time than <span Class="emphasis">timeout_ms</span>, that shorter time will be used instead to make sure timeout accuracy is reasonably kept. 
 <p class="level0">The calling application may pass additional curl_waitfd structures which are similar to <span Class="emphasis">poll(2)</span>'s pollfd structure to be waited on in the same call. 
 <p class="level0">On completion, if <span Class="emphasis">numfds</span> is non-NULL, it will be populated with the total number of file descriptors on which interesting events occured. This number can include both libcurl internal descriptors as well as descriptors provided in <span Class="emphasis">extra_fds</span>. 
 <p class="level0">If no extra file descriptors are provided and libcurl has no file descriptor to offer to wait for, this function will return immediately. 
 <p class="level0">This function is encouraged to be used instead of select(3) when using the multi interface to allow applications to easier circumvent the common problem with 1024 maximum file descriptors. <a name="curlwaitfd"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">curl_waitfd</h2>

 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">age</span> describes what the age of this struct is. The number depends on how new the libcurl you're using is. You are however guaranteed to get a struct that you have a matching struct for in the header, as you tell libcurl your "age" with the input argument. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">version</span> is just an ascii string for the libcurl version. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">version_num</span> is a 24 bit number created like this: &lt;8 bits major number&gt; | &lt;8 bits minor number&gt; | &lt;8 bits patch number&gt;. Version 7.9.8 is therefore returned as 0x070908. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">host</span> is an ascii string showing what host information that this libcurl was built for. As discovered by a configure script or set by the build environment.

 <p class="level0">The first version is the simple POST, the most common version, that most HTML pages using the &lt;form&gt; tag uses. We provide a pointer to the data and tell libcurl to post it all to the remote site: 
-<p class="level0"><pre>

 <p class="level0">Simple enough, huh? Since you set the POST options with the <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)</span>, this automatically switches the handle to use POST in the upcoming request. 
 <p class="level0">Ok, so what if you want to post binary data that also requires you to set the Content-Type: header of the post? Well, binary posts prevent libcurl from being able to do strlen() on the data to figure out the size, so therefore we must tell libcurl the size of the post data. Setting headers in libcurl requests are done in a generic way, by building a list of our own headers and then passing that list to libcurl.

 <p class="level0">While the simple examples above cover the majority of all cases where HTTP POST operations are required, they don't do multi-part formposts. Multi-part formposts were introduced as a better way to post (possibly large) binary data and were first documented in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt">RFC 1867</a> (updated in RFC2388). They're called multi-part because they're built by a chain of parts, each part being a single unit of data. Each part has its own name and contents. You can in fact create and post a multi-part formpost with the regular libcurl POST support described above, but that would require that you build a formpost yourself and provide to libcurl. To make that easier, libcurl provides <a Class="emphasis" href="./curl_formadd.html">curl_formadd</a>. Using this function, you add parts to the form. When you're done adding parts, you post the whole form.

 <p class="level0">Multipart formposts are chains of parts using MIME-style separators and headers. It means that each one of these separate parts get a few headers set that describe the individual content-type, size etc. To enable your application to handicraft this formpost even more, libcurl allows you to supply your own set of custom headers to such an individual form part. You can of course supply headers to as many parts as you like, but this little example will show how you set headers to one specific part when you add that to the post handle:

 CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION, timer_callback);
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype
 shown above.
 
-This callback function will be called when the timeout value changes. The
-\fBtimeout_ms\fP value is at what latest time the application should call one
-of the \&"performing" functions of the multi interface
-(\fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP and \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP) - to allow
-libcurl to keep timeouts and retries etc to work. A \fBtimeout_ms\fP value of
--1 means that there is no timeout at all, and 0 means that the timeout is
-already expired. libcurl attempts to limit calling this only when the fixed
-future timeout time actually changes.
+Certain features, such as timeouts and retries, require you to call libcurl
+even when there is no activity on the file descriptors.
+
+Your callback function \fBtimer_callback\fP should install a non-repeating
+timer with an interval of \fBtimeout_ms\fP. Each time that timer fires, call
+either \fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP or \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP,
+depending on which interface you use.
+
+A \fBtimeout_ms\fP value of -1 means you should delete your timer.
+
+A \fBtimeout_ms\fP value of 0 means you should call
+\fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP or \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP (once) as soon
+as possible.
+
+\fBtimer_callback\fP will only be called when the \fBtimeout_ms\fP changes.
 
 The \fBuserp\fP pointer is set with \fICURLMOPT_TIMERDATA(3)\fP.
 
 The timer callback should return 0 on success, and -1 on error. This callback
 can be used instead of, or in addition to, \fIcurl_multi_timeout(3)\fP.

 Pass a long set to 1 to enable libcurl's certificate chain info gatherer. With
-this enabled, libcurl (if built with OpenSSL, NSS or GSKit) will
-extract lots of information and data about the certificates in the certificate
-chain used in the SSL connection. This data may then be retrieved after a
-transfer using \fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP and its option
-\fICURLINFO_CERTINFO\fP.

 <p class="level0">Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. It specifies that the FTP transfer will be made actively and the given string will be used to get the IP address to use for the FTP PORT instruction. 
 <p class="level0">The PORT instruction tells the remote server to connect to our specified IP address. The string may be a plain IP address, a host name, a network interface name (under Unix) or just a '-' symbol to let the library use your system's default IP address. Default FTP operations are passive, and thus won't use PORT. 
 <p class="level0">The address can be followed by a ':' to specify a port, optionally followed by a '-' to specify a port range.  If the port specified is 0, the operating system will pick a free port.  If a range is provided and all ports in the range are not available, libcurl will report CURLE_FTP_PORT_FAILED for the handle.  Invalid port/range settings are ignored.  IPv6 addresses followed by a port or portrange have to be in brackets.  IPv6 addresses without port/range specifier can be in brackets. 
 <p class="level0">Examples with specified ports:

 <p class="level0">If this option is not set, or if it is set to NULL, but <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_HEADERDATA.html">CURLOPT_HEADERDATA</a> is set to anything but NULL, the function used to accept response data will be used instead. That is, it will be the function specified with <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION.html">CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</a>, or if it is not specified or NULL - the default, stream-writing function. 
 <p class="level0">It's important to note that the callback will be invoked for the headers of all responses received after initiating a request and not just the final response. This includes all responses which occur during authentication negotiation. If you need to operate on only the headers from the final response, you will need to collect headers in the callback yourself and use HTTP status lines, for example, to delimit response boundaries. 
 <p class="level0">When a server sends a chunked encoded transfer, it may contain a trailer. That trailer is identical to a HTTP header and if such a trailer is received it is passed to the application using this callback as well. There are several ways to detect it being a trailer and not an ordinary header: 1) it comes after the response-body. 2) it comes after the final header line (CR LF) 3) a Trailer: header among the regular response-headers mention what header(s) to expect in the trailer.

 Pass a pointer to a linked list of \fIaliases\fP to be treated as valid HTTP
 200 responses.  Some servers respond with a custom header response line.  For
-example, IceCast servers respond with "ICY 200 OK".  By including this string

-line such as "HTTP/1.0 200 OK".
+example, SHOUTcast servers respond with "ICY 200 OK". Also some very old
+Icecast 1.3.x servers will respond like that for certain user agent headers or
+in absence of such. By including this string in your list of aliases,
+the response will be treated as a valid HTTP header line such as
+"HTTP/1.0 200 OK".
 
 The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct curl_slist structs, and
 be properly filled in.  Use \fIcurl_slist_append(3)\fP to create the list and
 \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP to clean up an entire list.
 
 The alias itself is not parsed for any version strings. The protocol is

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
 <p class="level0">Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype shown above. 
 <p class="level0">This callback function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received interleaved RTP data. This function gets called for each $ block and therefore contains exactly one upper-layer protocol unit (e.g.  one RTP packet). Curl writes the interleaved header as well as the included data for each call. The first byte is always an ASCII dollar sign. The dollar sign is followed by a one byte channel identifier and then a 2 byte integer length in network byte order. See <span Class="emphasis"><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2326.txt">RFC 2326</a> Section 10.12</span> for more information on how RTP interleaving behaves. If unset or set to NULL, curl will use the default write function. 
 <p class="level0">Interleaved RTP poses some challenges for the client application. Since the stream data is sharing the RTSP control connection, it is critical to service the RTP in a timely fashion. If the RTP data is not handled quickly, subsequent response processing may become unreasonably delayed and the connection may close. The application may use <span Class="emphasis">CURL_RTSPREQ_RECEIVE</span> to service RTP data when no requests are desired. If the application makes a request, (e.g.  <span Class="emphasis">CURL_RTSPREQ_PAUSE</span>) then the response handler will process any pending RTP data before marking the request as finished. <a name="DEFAULT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DEFAULT</h2>

 <p class="level0">Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype shown above. 
 <p class="level0">This callback function gets called by libcurl instead of the <span Class="emphasis">socket(2)</span> call. The callback's <span Class="emphasis">purpose</span> argument identifies the exact purpose for this particular socket: <span Class="emphasis">CURLSOCKTYPE_IPCXN</span> is for IP based connections and <span Class="emphasis">CURLSOCKTYPE_ACCEPT</span> is for sockets created after accept() - such as when doing active FTP. Future versions of libcurl may support more purposes. 
 <p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">clientp</span> pointer contains whatever user-defined value set using the <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETDATA.html">CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETDATA</a> function. 
 <p class="level0">The callback gets the resolved peer address as the <span Class="emphasis">address</span> argument and is allowed to modify the address or refuse to connect completely. The callback function should return the newly created socket or <span Class="emphasis">CURL_SOCKET_BAD</span> in case no connection could be established or another error was detected. Any additional <span Class="emphasis">setsockopt(2)</span> calls can of course be done on the socket at the user's discretion.  A <span Class="emphasis">CURL_SOCKET_BAD</span> return value from the callback function will signal an unrecoverable error to libcurl and it will return <span Class="emphasis">CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT</span> from the function that triggered this callback. This return code can be used for IP address blacklisting. 
 <p class="level0">If you want to pass in a socket with an already established connection, pass the socket back with this callback and then use <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION.html">CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION</a> to signal that it already is connected. <a name="DEFAULT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DEFAULT</h2>

 <p class="level0">Pass a bitmask to control how libcurl acts on redirects after POSTs that get a 301, 302 or 303 response back.  A parameter with bit 0 set (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_301</span>) tells the library to respect <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a>/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. Setting bit 1 (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_302</span>) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a 302 redirect whilst setting bit 2 (value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_303</span>) makes libcurl maintain the request method after a 303 redirect. The value <span Class="bold">CURL_REDIR_POST_ALL</span> is a convenience define that sets all three bits. 
 <p class="level0">The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers, so the library does the conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a POST after such a redirection.

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
 <p class="level0">Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype shown above. 
 <p class="level0">This function gets called by libcurl to seek to a certain position in the input stream and can be used to fast forward a file in a resumed upload (instead of reading all uploaded bytes with the normal read function/callback). It is also called to rewind a stream when data has already been sent to the server and needs to be sent again. This may happen when doing a HTTP PUT or POST with a multi-pass authentication method, or when an existing HTTP connection is reused too late and the server closes the connection. The function shall work like fseek(3) or lseek(3) and it gets SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END as argument for <span Class="emphasis">origin</span>, although libcurl currently only passes SEEK_SET. 
 <p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">userp</span> is the pointer you set with <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_SEEKDATA.html">CURLOPT_SEEKDATA</a>. 
 <p class="level0">The callback function must return <span Class="emphasis">CURL_SEEKFUNC_OK</span> on success, <span Class="emphasis">CURL_SEEKFUNC_FAIL</span> to cause the upload operation to fail or <span Class="emphasis">CURL_SEEKFUNC_CANTSEEK</span> to indicate that while the seek failed, libcurl is free to work around the problem if possible. The latter can sometimes be done by instead reading from the input or similar. 
 <p class="level0">If you forward the input arguments directly to fseek(3) or lseek(3), note that the data type for <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> is not the same as defined for curl_off_t on many systems! <a name="DEFAULT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DEFAULT</h2>

+This option only works for libcurl powered by OpenSSL or wolfSSL/CyaSSL. If
+libcurl was built against another SSL library this functionality is absent.
 
 Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype
 shown above.
 
 This callback function gets called by libcurl just before the initialization
-of a SSL connection after having processed all other SSL related options to
-give a last chance to an application to modify the behaviour of openssl's ssl
-initialization. The \fIsslctx\fP parameter is actually a pointer to an openssl
-\fISSL_CTX\fP. If an error is returned from the callback, no attempt to
-establish a connection is made and the perform operation will return the error
-code.  Set the \fIuserptr\fP argument with the \fICURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA(3)\fP
-option.

+library's \fISSL_CTX\fP. If an error is returned from the callback no attempt
+to establish a connection is made and the perform operation will return the
+callback's error code. Set the \fIuserptr\fP argument with the
+\fICURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA(3)\fP option.
 
 This function will get called on all new connections made to a server, during
 the SSL negotiation. The SSL_CTX pointer will be a new one every time.
 
-To use this properly, a non-trivial amount of knowledge of the openssl
-libraries is necessary. For example, using this function allows you to use
-openssl callbacks to add additional validation code for certificates, and even
-to change the actual URI of a HTTPS request (example used in the lib509 test

 <p class="level0">Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype shown above. 
-<p class="level0">This callback function gets called by libcurl just before the initialization of a SSL connection after having processed all other SSL related options to give a last chance to an application to modify the behaviour of openssl's ssl initialization. The <span Class="emphasis">sslctx</span> parameter is actually a pointer to an openssl <span Class="emphasis">SSL_CTX</span>. If an error is returned from the callback, no attempt to establish a connection is made and the perform operation will return the error code.  Set the <span Class="emphasis">userptr</span> argument with the <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA.html">CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA</a> option.

-<p class="level0">To use this properly, a non-trivial amount of knowledge of the openssl libraries is necessary. For example, using this function allows you to use openssl callbacks to add additional validation code for certificates, and even to change the actual URI of a HTTPS request (example used in the lib509 test case).

 <p class="level0">When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity.  Curl verifies whether the certificate is authentic, i.e. that you can trust that the server is who the certificate says it is. This trust is based on a chain of digital signatures, rooted in certification authority (CA) certificates you supply.  curl uses a default bundle of CA certificates (the path for that is determined at build time) and you can specify alternate certificates with the <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_CAINFO.html">CURLOPT_CAINFO</a> option or the <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_CAPATH.html">CURLOPT_CAPATH</a> option. 
 <p class="level0">When <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER.html">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</a> is enabled, and the verification fails to prove that the certificate is authentic, the connection fails.  When the option is zero, the peer certificate verification succeeds regardless. 
 <p class="level0">Authenticating the certificate is not enough to be sure about the server. You typically also want to ensure that the server is the server you mean to be talking to.  Use <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST.html">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</a> for that. The check that the host name in the certificate is valid for the host name you're connecting to is done independently of the <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER.html">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</a> option. 
 <p class="level0">WARNING: disabling verification of the certificate allows bad guys to man-in-the-middle the communication without you knowing it. Disabling verification makes the communication insecure.

 .SH DEFAULT
 There is no default URL. If this option isn't set, no transfer can be
 performed.
+.SH SECURITY CONCERNS
+Applications may at times find it convenient to allow users to specify URLs
+for various purposes and that string would then end up fed to this option.
+
+Getting a URL from an external untrusted party will bring reasons for several
+security concerns:
+
+If you have an application that runs as or in a server application, getting an
+unfiltered URL can easily trick your application to access a local resource
+instead of a remote. Protecting yourself against localhost accesses is very
+hard when accepting user provided URLs.
+
+Such custom URLs can also access other ports than you planned as port numbers
+are part of the regular URL format. The combination of a local host and a
+custom port number can allow external users to play tricks with your local
+services.
+
+Accepting external URLs may also use other protocols than http:// or other
+common ones. Restrict what accept with \fICURLOPT_PROTOCOLS(3)\fP.
+
+User provided URLs can also be made to point to sites that redirect further on
+(possibly to other protocols too). Consider your

If <a Class="emphasis" href="./CURLOPT_HEADER.html">CURLOPT_HEADER</a> is enabled, which makes header data get passed to the write callback, you can get up to <span Class="emphasis">CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER</span> bytes of header data passed into it.

+
+ Example, send two GETs:

+
+ If you use --data to POST to the URL, using multiple URLs means that you send
+ that same POST to all the given URLs.

+
+    curl --data name=curl http://url1.example.com http://url2.example.com
+
+
+ 3.4 Multiple HTTP methods in a single command line
+
+ Sometimes you need to operate on several URLs in a single command line and do
+ different HTTP methods on each. For this, you'll enjoy the --next option. It
+ is basically a separator that separates a bunch of options from the next. All
+ the URLs before --next will get the same method and will get all the POST
+ data merged into one.
+
+ When curl reaches the --next on the command line, it'll sort of reset the
+ method and the POST data and allow a new set.

 17.6 warning when setting an option
 
   Display a warning when libcurl returns an error when setting an option.
   This can be useful to tell when support for a particular feature hasn't been
   compiled into the library.
 
+17.7 warning when sending binary output to terminal
+
+  Provide a way that prompts the user for confirmation before binary data is
+  sent to the terminal, much in the style 'less' does it.
+
+17.8 offer color-coded HTTP header output
+
+  By offering different color output on the header name and the header
+  contents, they could be made more readable and thus help users working on
+  HTTP services.
+
+17.9 Choose the name of file in braces for complex URLs
+
+  When using braces to download a list of URLs and you use complicated names
+  in the list of alternatives, it could be handy to allow curl to use other
+  names when saving.
+
+  Consider a way to offer that. Possibly like
+  {partURL1:name1,partURL2:name2,partURL3:name3} where the name following the
+  colon is the output name.
+
+  See https://github.com/bagder/curl/issues/221
+
+
 18. Build
 
 18.1 roffit
 
  Consider extending 'roffit' to produce decent ASCII output, and use that
  instead of (g)nroff when building src/tool_hugehelp.c
