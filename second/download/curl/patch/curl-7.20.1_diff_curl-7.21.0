+Version 7.21.0 (16 June 2010)
+
+Daniel Stenberg (5 June 2010)
+- Constantine Sapuntzakis fixed a case of spurious SSL connection aborts using
+  libcurl and OpenSSL. "I tracked it down to uncleared error state on the
+  OpenSSL error stack - patch attached deals with that."
+
+Daniel Stenberg (5 June 2010)
+- Frank Meier added CURLINFO_PRIMARY_PORT, CURLINFO_LOCAL_IP and
+  CURLINFO_LOCAL_PORT to curl_easy_getinfo().
+
+Yang Tse (4 June 2010)
+- Enabled OpenLDAP support for cygwin builds. This support was disabled back
+  in 2008 due to incompatibilities between OpenSSL and OpenLDAP headers.
+  cygwin's OpenSSL 0.9.8l and OpenLDAP 2.3.43 versions on cygwin 1.5.25
+  allow building an OpenLDAP enabled libcurl supporting back to Windows 95.
+
+  Removed the non-functional CURL_LDAP_HYBRID code and references.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 June 2010)
+- Jason McDonald posted bug report #3006786 when he found that the SFTP code
+  didn't timeout properly in several places in the code even if a timeout was
+  set properly.
+
+  Based on his suggested patch, I wrote a different implementation that I
+  think addressed the issue better and also uses the connect timeout for the
+  initial part of the SSH/SFTP done during the "protocol connect" phase.
+
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3006786)
+
+Yang Tse (2 June 2010)
+- Added missing new libcurl files to non-configure targets. Adjusted
+  libcurl standard internal header inclusions in new files. Fixed an
+  SPNEGO related memory leak. Fixed several LDAP related compilation
+  issues, and fixed some compiler warnings.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (1 June 2010)
+- Igor Novoseltsev reported a problem with the multi socket API and using
+  timeouts and timers. It boiled down to a problem with libcurl's use of
+  GetTickCount() interally to figure out the current time, while Igor's own
+  application code used another function call.
+
+  It made his app call the socket API timeout function a bit _before_ libcurl
+  would consider the timeout to trigger, and that could easily lead to
+  timeouts or stalls in the app. It seems GetTickCount() in general often has
+  no better resolution than 16ms and switching to the alternative function
+  QueryPerformanceCounter has its share of problems:
+      http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=106
+
+  We address this problem by simply having libcurl treat timers that already
+  has occured or will occur within 40ms subject for treatment. I'm confident
+  that there are other implementations and operating systems with similarly in
+  accurate timer functions so it makes sense to have applied generically and I
+  don't believe we sacrifice much by adding a 40ms inaccuracy on these
+  timeouts.
+
+Kamil Dudka (27 May 2010)
+- added a new test for CRL support (test313)
+
+- Tor Arntsen changed the alternative definition of bool to use enum instead
+  of unsigned char.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (25 May 2010)
+- Julien Chaffraix fixed the warning seen when compiling lib/rtmp.c: one
+  unused variables, several unused arguments and some missing #include.
+
+- Julien Chaffraix fixed 2 OOM errors: a missing NULL-check in
+  lib/http_negociate.c and a potential NULL dereferencing in lib/splay.c
+
+- Howard Chu brought a patch that makes the LDAP code much cleaner, nicer and
+  in general being a better libcurl citizen. If a new enough OpenLDAP version
+  is detect, the new and shiny lib/openldap.c code is then used instead of the
+  old cruft.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (21 May 2010)
+- Eric Mertens posted bug #3003705: when we made TFTP use the correct timeout
+  option when sent to the server (fixed May 18th 2010) it became obvious that
+  libcurl used invalid timeout values (300 by default while the RFC allows
+  nothing above 255). While of course it is obvious that as TFTP has worked
+  thus far without being able to set timeout at all, just removing the setting
+  wouldn't make any difference in behavior. I decided to still keep it (but
+  fix the problem) as it now actually allows for easier (future) customization
+  of the timeout.
+
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3003705)
+
+- Douglas Kilpatrick filed bug report #3004787 and pointed out that the TFTP
+  code didn't handle block id wraps correctly. His suggested fix inspired the
+  fix I committed.
+
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3004787)
+
+Daniel Stenberg (20 May 2010)
+- Tanguy Fautre brought a fix to allow curl to build with Microsoft VC10.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (18 May 2010)
+- Eric Mertens posted bug report #3003005 pointing out that the libcurl TFTP
+  code was not sending the timeout option properly to the server, and
+  suggested a fix.
+
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3003005)
+
+Kamil Dudka (16 May 2010)
+- Pavel Raiskup introduced a new option CURLOPT_FNMATCH_DATA in order to pass
+  a custom data pointer to the callback specified by CURLOPT_FNMATCH_FUNCTION.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (14 May 2010)
+- John-Mark Bell filed bug #3000052 that identified a problem (with an
+  associated patch) with the OpenSSL handshake state machine when the multi
+  interface is used:
+
+  Performing an https request using a curl multi handle and using select or
+  epoll to wait for events results in a hang. It appears that the cause is the
+  fix for bug #2958179, which makes ossl_connect_common unconditionally return
+  from the step 2 loop when fetching from a multi handle.
+
+  When ossl_connect_step2 has completed, it updates connssl->connecting_state
+  to ssl_connect_3. ossl_connect_common will then return to the caller, as a
+  multi handle is in use. Eventually, the client code will call
+  curl_multi_fdset to obtain an updated fdset to select or epoll on. For https
+  requests, curl_multi_fdset will cause https_getsock to be called.
+  https_getsock will only return a socket handle if the connecting_state is
+  ssl_connect_2_reading or ssl_connect_2_writing.  Therefore, the client will
+  never obtain a valid fdset, and thus not drive the multi handle, resulting
+  in a hang.
+
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3000052)
+
+- Sebastian V reported bug #3000056 identifying a problem with redirect
+  following. It showed that when curl followed redirects it didn't properly
+  ignore the response body of the 30X response if that response was using
+  compressed Content-Encoding!
+
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3000056)
+  
+Daniel Stenberg (12 May 2010)
+- Howard Chu brought support for RTMP. This is powered by the underlying
+  librtmp library. It supports a range of variations and "sub-protocols"
+  within the RTMP family.
+
+- Pavel Raiskup brought support for FTP directory wildcard matching to allow
+  selective downloading. To provide that, a set of new options were added:
+
+   CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH
+   CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION
+   CURLOPT_CHUNK_END_FUNCTION
+   CURLOPT_CHUNK_DATA
+   CURLOPT_FNMATCH_FUNCTION
+
+  There were also a set of new tests added (574 - 577) to verify this.
+
+Kamil Dudka (11 May 2010)
+- CRL support in libcurl-NSS has been completely broken. Now it works. Original
+  bug report: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/581926
+
+Daniel Stenberg (7 May 2010)
+- Dirk Manske reported a regression. When connecting with the multi interface,
+  there were situations where libcurl wouldn't store connect time correctly as
+  it used to (and is documented to) do.
+
+  Using his fine sample program we could repeat it, and I wrote up test case
+  573 using that code. The problem does not easily show itself using the local
+  test suite though.
+
+  The fix, also as suggested by Dirk, is a bit on the ugly side as it adds yet
+  another call to Curl_verboseconnect() and setting the TIMER_CONNECT time.
+  That situation is subject for some closer inspection in the future.
+
+- Howard Chu split the I/O handling functions into private handlers.
+    
+  Howard Chu brought the bulk work of this patch that properly moves out the
+  sending and recving of data to the parts of the code that are properly
+  responsible for the various ways of doing so.
+  
+  Daniel Stenberg assisted with polishing a few bits and fixed some minor
+  flaws in the original patch.
+  
+  Another upside of this patch is that we now abuse CURLcodes less with the
+  "magic" -1 return codes and instead use CURLE_AGAIN more consistently.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (5 May 2010)
+- Hoi-Ho Chan introduced support for using the PolarSSL library. You control
+  this with the new configure option --with-polarssl.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (29 Apr 2010)
+- Ben Greear made telnet a lot better/easier to use by an application:
+
+  The main change is to allow input from user-specified methods, when they are
+  specified with CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.  All calls to fflush(stdout) in
+  telnet.c were removed, which makes using 'curl telnet://foo.com' painful
+  since prompts and other data are not always returned to the user promptly.
+  Use 'curl --no-buffer telnet://foo.com' instead.  In general, the user
+  should have their CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION do a fflush for interactive use.
+
+  Also fix assumption that reading from stdin never returns < 0.
+  Old code could crash in that case.
+
+  Call progress functions in telnet main loop.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (26 Apr 2010)
+- Make use of the libssh2_init/exit functions that libssh2 added in version
+  1.2.5. Using them will improve how libcurl works in threaded situations when
+  SCP and SFTP are transfered.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (25 Apr 2010)
+- Based on work by Kamil Dudka, I've introduced the new configure option
+  --enable-threaded-resolver. When used, the configure script will check for
+  pthreads and if around, it will build libcurl to use pthreads to do name
+  resolving in a threaded manner. Note that this is just a fix to offer an
+  option that can enable the code that already included. The threader resolver
+  code was mostly added on Jan 26 2010.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (24 Apr 2010)
+- Alex Bligh introduced the --proto and -proto-redir options that limit what
+  protocols curl accepts for the requests and when following redirects.
+
+Kamil Dudka (24 Apr 2010)
+- Fixed test536 in order to not fail with threaded DNS resolver and tweaked
+  comments in certain examples using curl_multi_fdset().
+
+- Fixed SSL handshake timeout underflow in libcurl-NSS, which caused test405
+  to hang on a slow machine.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (21 Apr 2010)
+- The -O option caused curl to crash on windows and DOS due to the tool
+  writing out of boundary memory.
+
+Yang Tse (20 Apr 2010)
+- Ruslan Gazizov detected that MSVC makefiles were using wsock32.lib instead
+  of ws2_32.lib, this generated linking issues on MSVC IPv6 enabled builds
+  that were done using those makefiles.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (19 Apr 2010)
+- -J/--remote-header-name didn't strip trailing carriage returns or linefeeds
+  properly, so they could be used in the file name.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (16 Apr 2010)
+- Jerome Vouillon made the GnuTLS SSL handshake phase non-blocking.
+
+- The recent overhaul of the SSL recv function made the GnuTLS specific code
+  treat a zero returned from gnutls_record_recv() as an error, and this caused
+  our HTTPS test cases to fail. We leave it to upper layer code to detect if
+  an EOF is a problem or not.
+
+- I reverted the resolver fix from yesterday and instead removed all uses of
+  AI_CANONNAME all over libcurl and made the only user of that info (krb5.c)
+  use the host name from the URL instead. No reverse resolving is a good
+  thing.
+
+- Paul Howarth made configure properly detect GSS "on ancient Linux distros"
+  by editing in which order we use headers to detect GSS.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (15 Apr 2010)
+- Rainer Canavan filed bug report #2987196 that identified libcurl doing
+  unnecesary reverse name lookups in many cases when built to use IPv4 and
+  getaddrinfo(). The logic for ipv6 is now used for ipv4 too.
+

 Version 7.20.1 (14 April 2010)
 
 Daniel Stenberg (9 Apr 2010)
 - Prefixing the FTP quote commands with an asterisk really only worked for the
   postquote actions. This is now fixed and test case 227 has been extended to
   verify.

This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received interleaved RTP data. This function gets called for each $ block and therefore contains exactly one upper-layer protocol unit (e.g.  one RTP packet). Curl writes the interleaved header as well as the included data for each call. The first byte is always an ASCII dollar sign. The dollar sign is followed by a one byte channel identifier and then a 2 byte integer length in network byte order. See <span Class="emphasis">RFC 2326 Section 10.12</span> for more information on how RTP interleaving behaves. If unset or set to NULL, curl will use the default write function. 
 <p class="level1">Interleaved RTP poses some challeneges for the client application. Since the stream data is sharing the RTSP control connection, it is critical to service the RTP in a timely fashion. If the RTP data is not handled quickly, subsequent response processing may become unreasonably delayed and the connection may close. The application may use <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLRTSPREQRECEIVE">CURL_RTSPREQ_RECEIVE</a> to service RTP data when no requests are desired. If the application makes a request, (e.g.  <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLRTSPREQPAUSE">CURL_RTSPREQ_PAUSE</a>) then the response handler will process any pending RTP data before marking the request as finished.

 9. Other protocols
 
-9.1 ditch ldap-specific select
-
- * Look over the implementation. The looping will have to "go away" from the

-10.1 RTSP
-
- RFC2326 (protocol - very HTTP-like, also contains URL description)
-
-10.2 RSYNC

  There's no RFC for protocol nor URI/URL format.  An implementation should
  most probably use an existing rsync library, such as librsync.

  Downloads a range or set of URLs using the remote name, but only if the
  remote file is newer than the local file. A Last-Modified HTTP date header
  should also be used to set the mod date on the downloaded file.
 
-11.3 glob posts
+11.2 glob posts
 
  Globbing support for -d and -F, as in 'curl -d "name=foo[0-9]" URL'.
  This is easily scripted though.
 
-11.4 prevent file overwriting
+11.3 prevent file overwriting
 
  Add an option that prevents cURL from overwriting existing local files. When
  used, and there already is an existing file with the target file name
  (either -O or -o), a number should be appended (and increased if already
  existing). So that index.html becomes first index.html.1 and then
  index.html.2 etc.
