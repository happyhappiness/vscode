+Version 7.7.2
+
+Daniel (22 April 2001)
+- Rosimildo da Silva updated the Makefiles for Borland/Windows.
+
+- Eric Rautman pointed out a problem with persistent connections that would
+  lead to broken Host: headers in the second HTTP request.
+
+Daniel (20 April 2001)
+- Added man pages for the curl_strequal() and curl_mprintf() families. Wrote
+  a 'libcurl overview' man page.
+
+- Spell-fixed some documents.
+
+- S. Moonesamy corrected mistakes in the man page.
+
+- Cris Bailiff fixed the curl_slists options in the perl interface, present
+  separately in the Curl::easy 1.1.4 package.
+
+Daniel (19 April 2001)
+- Linus Nielsen Feltzing removed the decimals from the size variables in the
+  --write-out output. We hardly ever get fraction of bytes! :-)
+
+Version 7.7.2-pre1
+
+Daniel (19 April 2001)
+
+- Albert Chin provided a configure patch for the AC_SYS_LARGEFILE macro.
+
+Daniel (18 April 2001)
+- Input from Michael Mealling made me add --feature to curl-config. It
+  displays a list of features that have been built-in in the current
+  libcurl. The currently available features that can be listed are: SSL, KRB4
+  and IPv6.
+
+- I committed Cris and Georg's perl interface work. They've got callbacks
+  working and options that receives those slist pointers.
+
+- Puneet Pawaia detected a problem with resumed downloads that use persistent
+  connections and I made a rather large writeup to correct this. It is
+  important that all session-data is stored in the connectdata struct and not
+  in the main struct as this previously did.
+
+Daniel (17 April 2001)
+- Frederic Lepied fixed a ftp resumed download problem and introduced a new
+  error code that lets applications be able to detect when a resumed download
+  actually didn't download anything since the whole file is already present.
+  Should this return OK instead?
+
+- I added 'curl-config.in' to the root dir and configure script. Now, a
+  curl-config script is made when curl is built. The script can be used to
+  figure out compile time options used when libcurl was built, which in turn
+  should be options YOU should use to build applications that use libcurl.
+
+  This *-config style is not a new idea, but something that has been used
+  successfully in other (library based) projects.
+
+- Phil Karn pointed out that libcurl wrongly did not always use GMT time zone
+  for the If-Modified-Since style headers.
+
+- Georg Schwarz pointed out an extra needed #include file needed in src/main.c
+  for curl to build on Ultrix.
+
+Daniel (11 April 2001)
+- Cris Bailiff pointed out two problems that I corrected. First, libcurl's use
+  of the environment variable HTTP_PROXY in uppercase may become a security
+  hazard when people use libcurl in a server/cgi situation where the server
+  sets the HTTP_*-variables according to incoming headers in the HTTP
+  request. Thus, a "Proxy:"-header would set that environment variable!
+
+  Then, invoking curl_easy_perform() without having an URL set caused a crash.
+
+- S. Moonesamy brought a patch that make curl use non-blocking connects on
+  windows when connection timeout is set, as it allows windows users to set
+  that timeout!
+
+- Hirotaka Matsuyuki wrote a Ruby interface to libcurl!
+
+- Cris Bailiff, Forrest Cahoon and Georg Horn work on the Perl interface.
+
+- I've written a first shot at a Java interface to libcurl. Many thanks to
+  Daniel Marell for tirelessly answering to all my basic Java questions. It
+  works, but it is still very basic.
+
+Daniel (10 April 2001)
+- The progress display could get silly when doing multiple file transfers, as
+  it wasn't properly reset between transfers!
+
+- Discussions with Cris Bailiff who writes a Perl interface to libcurl, made
+  me add CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION. It can be used to set a separate callback
+  function for writing headers. Previously you could only set a different FILE
+  * when headers are written from within libcurl.
+
+Daniel (7 April 2001)
+- Andrés García fixed a problem in curl_escape() and pointed out a flaw in
+  the curl_easy_setopt man page.
+
+Daniel (6 April 2001)
+- Adjusted the version code to properly display OpenSSL 0.9.6a. They sure
+  change their version define format often...
+
+- curl_formfree() now accepts a NULL pointer without crashing!
+
 Version 7.7.1
 
 Daniel (3 April 2001)

  Things to do in project cURL. Please tell me what you think, contribute and
  send me patches that improve things!
 
 To do for the next release:
 
+ * Make sure SSL works even when IPv6 is enabled. We just can't connect to
+   IPv6 sites and use SSL, but we should detect that particular condition
+   and warn about it.
+
  * Make SSL session ids get used if multiple HTTPS documents from the same
    host is requested.
 
- * Document the undocumented libcurl functions: the printf clones (like
-   curl_msprintf, curl_mfprintf, curl_msnprintf, curl_maprintf and
-   curl_mvfprintf) and the string compare functions (curl_strequal
-   and curl_strnequal).
-
 To do in a future release (random order):
 
  * Rewrite parts of the test suite. Make a (XML?) format to store all
    test-data in a single for a single test case. The current system makes far
    too many separate files. We also need to have the test suite support
    different behaviors, like when libcurl is compiled for IPv6 support and
@@ -88,8 +87,6 @@
 
  * IPv6 Awareness and support. (This is partly done.)  RFC 2428 "FTP
    Extensions for IPv6 and NATs" is interesting. PORT should be replaced with
    EPRT for IPv6 (done), and EPSV instead of PASV.  HTTP proxies are left to
    add support for.
 
- * SSL for more protocols, like SSL-FTP...

 Revision history for Perl extension Curl::easy.
 Check out the file README for more info.
 
+1.1.5  Fri Apr 20 2001: - Cris Bailiff <c.bailiff@devsecure.com>
+    - Add latest CURLOPT_ and CURLINFO_ constants to the constants list
+
+1.1.4  Fri Apr 20 2001: - Cris Bailiff <c.bailiff@devsecure.com>
+    - Fix case where curl_slists such as 'HTTPHEADERS' need to
+      be re-set over persistant requests
+
+1.1.3  Wed Apr 18 2001: - Cris Bailiff <c.bailiff@devsecure.com>
+    - Change/shorten module function names: Curl::easy::curl_easy_setopt
+      becomes Curl::easy::setopt etc. This requires minor changes to existing
+      scripts....
+    - Added callback function support to pass arbitrary SV * (including
+	  FILE globs) from perl through libcurl to the perl callback.
+	- Make callbacks still work with existing scripts which use STDIO
+	- Initial support for libcurl 7.7.2 HEADERFUNCTION callback feature
+	- Minor API cleanups/changes in the callback function signatures
+	- Added Curl::easy::version function to return curl version string
+	- Callback documentation added in easy.pm
+    - More tests in test.pl
+
+1.1.2  Mon Apr 16 2001: - Georg Horn <horn@koblenz-net.de>
+    - Added support for callback functions. This is for the curl_easy_setopt()
+      options WRITEFUNCTION, READFUNCTION, PROGRESSFUNCTION and PASSWDFUNCTION.
+      Still missing, but not really neccessary: Passing a FILE * pointer,
+      that is passed in from libcurl, on to the perl callback function.
+    - Various cleanups, fixes and enhancements to easy.xs and test.pl.
+
+1.1.1  Thu Apr 12 2001:
+    - Made more options of curl_easy_setopt() work: Options that require
+      a list of curl_slist structs to be passed in, like CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,
+      are now working by passing a perl array containing the list elements.
+      As always, look at the test script test.pl for an example.
+
+1.1.0  Wed Apr 11 2001:
+    - tested against libcurl 7.7
+    - Added new function Curl::easy::internal_setopt(). By calling
+      Curl::easy::internal_setopt(Curl::easy::USE_INTERNAL_VARS, 1);
+      the headers and content of the fetched page are no longer stored
+      into files (or written to stdout) but are stored into internal
+      Variables $Curl::easy::headers and $Curl::easy::content.
+
 1.0.2  Tue Oct 10 2000:
     - runs with libcurl 7.4
     - modified curl_easy_getinfo(). It now calls curl_getinfo() that has
       been added to libcurl in version 7.4.

 Curl::easy - Perl extension for libcurl
 
 =head1 SYNOPSIS
 
   use Curl::easy;
-  
-  $CURL = curl_easy_init();
-  $CURLcode = curl_easy_setopt($CURL, CURLoption, Value);
-  $CURLcode = curl_easy_perform($CURL);

+  $curl = Curl::easy::init();
+  $CURLcode = Curl::easy::setopt($curl, CURLoption, Value);
+  $CURLcode = Curl::easy::perform($curl);
+  Curl::easy::cleanup($curl);
+ 
 =head1 DESCRIPTION
-
+ 
 This perl module provides an interface to the libcurl C library. See
 http://curl.haxx.se/ for more information on cURL and libcurl.
+ 
+=head1 FILES and CALLBACKS
 
-=head1 AUTHOR
+Curl::easy supports the various options of curl_easy_setopt which require either a FILE * or
+a callback function.
+
+The perl callback functions are handled through a C wrapper which takes care of converting
+from C to perl variables and back again. This wrapper simplifies some C arguments to make
+them behave in a more 'perl' like manner. In particular, the read and write callbacks do not
+look just like the 'fread' and 'fwrite' C functions - perl variables do not need separate length
+parameters, and perl functions can return a list of variables, instead of needing a pointer
+to modify. The details are described below.
+
+=head2 FILE handles (GLOBS)
+ 
+Curl options which take a FILE, such as CURLOPT_FILE, CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER, CURLOPT_INFILE
+can be passed a perl file handle:
+ 
+  open BODY,">body.out";
+  $CURLcode = Curl::easy::setopt($curl, CURLOPT_FILE, BODY);
+
+=head2 WRITE callback
+
+The CUROPT_WRITEFUNCTION option may be set which will cause libcurl to callback to
+the given subroutine:
+
+  sub chunk { my ($data,$pointer)=@_; ...; return length($data) }
+  $CURLcode = Curl::easy::setopt($curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, \&chunk );
+  $CURLcode = Curl::easy::setopt($curl, CURLOPT_FILE, );
+
+In this case, the subroutine will be passed whatever is defined by CURLOPT_FILE. This can be
+a ref to a scalar, or a GLOB or anything else you like.
+
+The callback function must return the number of bytes 'handled' ( length($data) ) or the transfer
+will abort. A transfer can be aborted by returning a 'length' of '-1'.
+
+The option CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER can be set to pass a different '$pointer' into the CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION 
+for header values. This lets you collect the headers and body separately:
+
+  my $headers="";
+  my $body="";
+  sub chunk { my ($data,$pointer)=@_; ${$pointer}.=$data; return length($data) }
+
+  $CURLcode = Curl::easy::setopt($curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, \&chunk );
+  $CURLcode = Curl::easy::setopt($curl, CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER, \$header );
+  $CURLcode = Curl::easy::setopt($curl, CURLOPT_FILE, \$body );
 
+If you have libcurl > 7.7.1, then you could instead set CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION to a different callback,
+and have the header collected that way.
+
+=head2 READ callback
+
+Curl::easy supports CURLOPT_READFUNCTION. This function should look something like this:
+
+    sub read_callback {
+        my ($maxlength,$pointer)=@_;
+
+		....
+
+        return $data;
+    }
+
+The subroutine must return an empty string "" at the end of the data. Note that this function
+isn't told how much data to provide - $maxlength is just the maximum size of the buffer
+provided by libcurl. If you are doing an HTTP POST or PUT for example, it is important that this
+function only returns as much data as the 'Content-Length' header specifies, followed by a
+an empty (0 length) buffer.
+
+=head2 PROGRESS callback
+
+Curl::easy supports CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION. This function should look something like this:
+
+    sub prog_callb
+    {
+        my ($clientp,$dltotal,$dlnow,$ultotal,$ulnow)=@_;
+		....
+        return 0;
+    }                        
+
+The function should return 0 normally, or -1 which will abort/cancel the transfer. $clientp is whatever
+value/scalar is set using the CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA option.
+
+=head2 PASSWD callback
+
+Curl::easy supports CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION. This function should look something like this:
+ 
+    sub passwd_callb
+    {
+		my ($clientp,$prompt,$buflen)=@_;
+		...
+    	return (0,$data);
+    }                    
+
+$clientp is whatever scalar is set using the CURLOPT_PASSWDDATA option.
+$prompt is a text string which can be used to prompt for a password.
+$buflen is the maximum accepted password reply.
+
+The function must return 0 (for 'OK') and the password data as a list. Return (-1,"") to
+indicate an error.
