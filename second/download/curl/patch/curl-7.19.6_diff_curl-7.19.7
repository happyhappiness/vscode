+Version 7.19.7 (4 November 2009)
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Nov 2009)
+- As reported independent by both Stan van de Burgt and Didier Brisebourg,
+  CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD (the -w variable size_download) didn't work when
+  getting data from ldap!
+
+Daniel Stenberg (31 Oct 2009)
+- Gabriel Kuri reported a problem with CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD if the
+  download was 0 bytes, as libcurl would then return the size as unknown (-1)
+  and not 0. I wrote a fix and test case 566 to verify it.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (30 Oct 2009)
+- Liza Alenchery mentioned a problem with re-used SCP connection when a bad
+  auth is used, as it caused a crash. I failed to repeat the issue, but still
+  made a change that now forces the TCP connection used for a freed SCP
+  session to get closed and not be re-used.
+
+- "Tom" posted a bug report that mentioned how libcurl did wrong when doing a
+  POST using a read callback, with Digest authentication and
+  "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" enforced.  I would then cause the first request
+  to be wrongly sent and then basically hang until the server closed the
+  connection. I fixed the problem and added test case 565 to verify it.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (25 Oct 2009)
+- Dima Barsky made the curl cookie parser accept cookies even with blank or
+  unparsable expiry dates and then treat them as session cookies - previously
+  libcurl would reject cookies with a date format it couldn't parse. Research
+  shows that the major browser treat such cookies as session cookies. I
+  modified test 8 and 31 to verify this.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (21 Oct 2009)
+- Attempt to use pkg-config for finding out libssh2 installation details
+  during configure.
+
+- A patch in bug report #2883177 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2883177)
+  by Johan van Selst introduced the --crlfile option to curl, which makes curl
+  tell libcurl about a file with CRL (certificate revocation list) data to
+  read.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (18 Oct 2009)
+- Ray Dassen provided a patch in Debian's bug tracker (bug number #551461)
+  that now makes curl_getdate(3) actually handles RFC 822 formatted dates that
+  use the "single letter military timezones".
+  http://www.rfc-ref.org/RFC-TEXTS/822/chapter5.html has the details.
+
+- Fixed memory leak in the SCP/SFTP code as it never freed the knownhosts
+  data!
+
+- John Dennis filed bug report #2873666
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2873666) which identified a problem
+  which made libcurl loop infinitely when given incorrect credentials when
+  using HTTP GSS negotiate authentication. He also provided a small and simple
+  patch for it.
+
+- Kevin Baughman found a double close() problem with libcurl-NSS, as when
+  libcurl called NSS to close the SSL "session" it also closed the actual
+  socket.
+
+Yang Tse (17 Oct 2009)
+- Bug report #2866724 indicated
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2866724) that curl on Windows failed
+  when writing files whose file names originally contained characters which
+  are not valid for file names on Windows. Dan Fandrich provided an initial
+  patch and another revised one to fix this issue.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (1 Oct 2009)
+- Tom Mueller correctly reported in bug report #2870221
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2870221) that libcurl returned an
+  incorrect return code from the internal trynextip() function which caused
+  him grief. This is a regression that was introduced in 7.19.1 and I find it
+  strange it hasn't hit us harder, but I won't persue into figuring out
+  exactly why.
+ 
+- Constantine Sapuntzakis: The current implementation will always set
+  SO_SNDBUF to CURL_WRITE_SIZE even if the SO_SNDBUF starts out larger.  The
+  patch doesn't do a setsockopt if SO_SNDBUF is already greater than
+  CURL_WRITE_SIZE. This should help folks who have set up their computer with
+  large send buffers.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (27 Sep 2009)
+- I introduced a maximum limit for received HTTP headers. It is controlled by
+  the define CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER which is even exposed in the public header
+  file to allow for users to fairly easy rebuild libcurl with a modified
+  limit. The rationale for a fixed limit is that libcurl is realloc()ing a
+  buffer to be able to put a full header into it, so that it can call the
+  header callback with the entire header, but that also risk getting it into
+  trouble if a server by mistake or willingly sends a header that is more or
+  less without an end. The limit is set to 100K.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (26 Sep 2009)
+- John P. McCaskey posted a bug report that showed how libcurl did wrong when
+  saving received cookies with no given path, if the path in the request had a
+  query part. That is means a question mark (?) and characters on the right
+  side of that. I wrote test case 1105 and fixed this problem.
+
+Kamil Dudka (26 Sep 2009)
+- Implemented a protocol independent way to specify blocking direction, used by
+  transfer.c for blocking. It is currently used only by SCP and SFTP protocols.
+  This enhancement resolves an issue with 100% CPU usage during SFTP upload,
+  reported by Vourhey.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (25 Sep 2009)
+- Chris Mumford filed bug report #2861587
+  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2861587) identifying that libcurl used
+  the OpenSSL function X509_load_crl_file() wrongly and failed if it would
+  load a CRL file with more than one certificate within. This is now fixed.
+  
+Daniel Stenberg (16 Sep 2009)
+- Sven Anders reported that we introduced a cert verfication flaw for OpenSSL-
+  powered libcurl in 7.19.6. If there was a X509v3 Subject Alternative Name
+  field in the certficate it had to match and so even if non-DNS and non-IP
+  entry was present it caused the verification to fail.
+
+Daniel Fandrich (15 Sep 2009)
+- Moved the libssh2 checks after the SSL library checks. This helps when
+  statically linking since libssh2 needs the SSL library link flags to be
+  set up already to satisfy its dependencies. This wouldn't be necessary if
+  the libssh2 configure check was changed to use pkg-config since the
+  --static flag would add the dependencies automatically.
+
+Yang Tse (14 Sep 2009)
+- Revert Joshua Kwan's patch committed 11 Sep 2009.
+
+  Some systems poll function sets POLLHUP in revents without setting
+  POLLIN, and sets POLLERR without setting POLLIN and POLLOUT. In some
+  libcurl code execution paths this could trigger busy wait loops with
+  high CPU usage until a timeout condition aborted the loop.
+
+  The reverted patch addressed the above issue for a very specific case,
+  when awaiting c-ares to resolve. A libcurl-wide fix for Curl_poll now
+  superceeds this one.
+
+Guenter Knauf (11 Sep 2009)
+- Joshua Kwan provided a patch to pass POLLERR / POLLHUP back to c-ares.
+  This fixes a loop problem with high CPU usage.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (10 Sep 2009)
+- Claes Jakobsson fixed a problem with cookie expiry dates at exctly the epoch
+  start second "Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 GMT 1970" as the date parser then returns 0
+  which internally then is treated as a session cookie. That particular date
+  is now made to get the value of 1.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (2 Sep 2009)
+- Daniel Johnson found a flaw in the code converting sftp-errors to libcurl
+  errors.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (1 Sep 2009)
+- Peter Sylvester made a debug feature for Curl_resolv() that now will force
+  libcurl to resolve 'localhost' whatever name you use in the URL *if* you set
+  the --interface option to (exactly) "LocalHost". This will enable us to
+  write tests for custom hosts names but still use a local host server.
+
+- configure now tries to use pkg-config for a number of sub-dependencies even
+  when cross-compiling. The key to success is then you properly setup
+  PKG_CONFIG_PATH before invoking configure.
+
+  I also improved how NSS is detected by trying nss-config if pkg-config isn't
+  present, and as a last resort just use the lib name and force the user to
+  setup the LIBS/LDFLAGS/CFLAGS etc properly. The previous last resort would
+  add a range of various libs that would almost never be quite correct.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (31 Aug 2009)
+- When using the multi interface with FTP and you asked for NOBODY, you did no
+  QUOTE commands and the request used the same path as the connection had
+  already changed to, it would decide that no commands would be necessary for
+  the "DO" action and that was not handled properly but libcurl would instead
+  hang.
+
+Kamil Dudka (28 Aug 2009)
+- Improved error message for not matching certificate subject name in
+  libcurl-NSS. Originally reported at:
+  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=516056#c9
+
+Patrick Monnerat (24 Aug 2009)
+- Introduced a SYST-based test to properly set-up name format when dealing
+  with the OS/400 FTP server.
+
+- Fixed an ftp_readresp() bug preventing detection of failing control socket
+  and causing FTP client to loop forever.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (24 Aug 2009)
+- Marc de Bruin pointed out that configure --with-gnutls=PATH didn't work
+  properly and provided a fix. http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2843008
+
+- Eric Wong introduced support for the new option -T. (dot) that makes curl
+  read stdin in a non-blocking fashion. This also brings back -T- (minus) to
+  the previous blocking behavior since it could break stuff for people at
+  times.
+
+Michal Marek (21 Aug 2009)
+- With CURLOPT_PROXY_TRANSFER_MODE, avoid sending invalid URLs like
+  ftp://example.com;type=i if the user specified ftp://example.com without the
+  slash.
+
+Daniel Stenberg (21 Aug 2009)
+- Andre Guibert de Bruet pointed out a missing return code check for a
+  strdup() that could lead to segfault if it returned NULL. I extended his
+  suggest patch to now have Curl_retry_request() return a regular return code
+  and better check that.
+
+- Lots of good work by Krister Johansen, mostly related to pipelining:
+
+  Fix SIGSEGV on free'd easy_conn when pipe unexpectedly breaks
+  Fix data corruption issue with re-connected transfers
+  Fix use after free if we're completed but easy_conn not NULL
+
+Kamil Dudka (13 Aug 2009)
+- Changed NSS code to not ignore the value of ssl.verifyhost and produce more
+  verbose error messages. Originally reported at:
+  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=516056
+
+Daniel Stenberg (12 Aug 2009)
+- Karl Moerder fixed the Makefile.vc* makefiles to include the new file
+  nonblock.c so that they work fine again
+
+- I expanded test 517 with a bunch of more dates that originate from the
+  Chrome browser test suite. It turns out most of them get parsed the same
+  way.
+
 Version 7.19.6 (12 August 2009)
 
 Daniel Stenberg (12 Aug 2009)
 - Carsten Lange reported a bug and provided a patch for TFTP upload and the
   sending of the TSIZE option. I don't like fixing bugs just hours before
   a release, but since it was broken and the patch fixes this for him I decided

 If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to guess what
 protocol you might want. It will then default to HTTP but try other protocols
 based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for host names starting
 with "ftp." curl will assume you want to speak FTP.

 Curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so that
 getting many files from the same server will not do multiple connects /
 handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on files
 specified on a single command line and cannot be used between separate curl
 invokes.

+   MSVC 6 caveats
+   --------------
+
+   If you use MSVC 6 it is required that you use the February 2003 edition PSDK:
+   http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm
+
+   Building any software with MSVC 6 without having PSDK installed is just
+   asking for trouble down the road once you have released it, you might notice
+   the problems in the first corner or ten miles ahead, depending mostly on your
+   choice of static vs dynamic runtime and third party libraries. Anyone using
+   software built in such way will at some point regret having done so.
+
+   When someone uses MSVC 6 without PSDK he is using a compiler back from 1998.
+
+   If the compiler has been updated with the installation of a service pack as
+   those mentioned in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/194022 the compiler can be
+   safely used to read source code, translate and make it object code.
+
+   But, even with the service packs mentioned above installed, the resulting
+   software generated in such an environment will be using outdated system
+   header files and libraries with bugs and security issues which have already
+   been addressed and fixed long time ago.
+
+   In order to make use of the updated system headers and fixed libraries
+   for MSVC 6, it is required that 'Platform SDK', PSDK from now onwards,
+   is installed. The specific PSDK that must be installed for MSVC 6 is the
+   February 2003 edition, which is the latest one supporting the MSVC 6 compiler,
+   this PSDK is also known as 'Windows Server 2003 PSDK' and can be downloaded
+   from http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm
+
+   So, building curl and libcurl with MSVC 6 without PSDK is absolutely
+   discouraged for the benefit of anyone using software built in such
+   environment. And it will not be supported in any way, as we could just
+   be hunting bugs which have already been fixed way back in 2003.
+
+   When building with MSVC 6 we attempt to detect if PSDK is not being used,
+   and if this is the case the build process will fail hard with an error
+   message stating that the February 2003 PSDK is required. This is done to
+   protect the unsuspecting and avoid PEBKAC issues.
+
+   Additionally it might happen that a die hard MSVC hacker still wants to
+   build curl and libcurl with MSVC 6 without PSDK installed, even knowing
+   that this is a highly discouraged and unsupported build environment. In
+   this case the brave of heart will be able to build in such an environment
+   with the requisite of defining preprocessor symbol ALLOW_MSVC6_WITHOUT_PSDK
+   in lib/config-win32.h and knowing that LDAP and IPv6 support will be missing.

That parameter can be a <span Class="bold">long</span>, a <span Class="bold">function pointer</span>, an <span Class="bold">object pointer</span> or a <span Class="bold">curl_off_t</span> type, depending on what the specific option expects. Read this manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl to behave badly! You can only set one option in each function call.

 <p class="level1">Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed to the <span Class="bold">curl_socket_callback</span>'s forth argument, the userp pointer.

 <p class="level1">Pass a long set to 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Enabling pipelining on a multi handle will make it attempt to perform HTTP Pipelining as far as possible for transfers using this handle. This means that if you add a second request that can use an already existing connection, the second request will be "piped" on the same connection rather than being executed in parallel.

 Neglecting to use one of the above methods when dealing with a server using a
 certificate that isn't signed by one of the certificates in the installed CA
 cert bundle, will cause SSL to report an error ("certificate verify failed")
 during the handshake and SSL will then refuse further communication with that
 server.

+                      Peer SSL Certificate Verification with NSS
+                      ==========================================
+
+If libcurl is build with NSS support then depending on the OS distribution it
+is probably required to take some additional steps to use the system-wide CA
+cert db. RedHat ships with an additional module libnsspem.so which enables NSS
+to read the OpenSSL PEM CA bundle. With OpenSuSE this lib is missing, and NSS
+can only work with its own internal formats. Also NSS got a new database
+format:
+https://wiki.mozilla.org/NSS_Shared_DB
+Starting with version 7.19.7 libcurl will check for the NSS version it runs,
+and add automatically the 'sql:' prefix to the certdb directory (either the
+hardcoded default /etc/pki/nssdb or the directory configured with SSL_DIR
+environment variable) if a version 3.12.0 or later is detected. 
+To check which certdb format your distribution provides examine the default
+certdb location /etc/pki/nssdb; the new certdb format can be identified by
+the filenames cert9.db, key4.db, pkcs11.txt; filenames of older versions are
+cert8.db, key3.db, modsec.db.
+Usually these cert databases are empty; but NSS also has built-in CAs which are
+provided through a shared library libnssckbi.so; if you want to use these
+built-in CAs then create a symlink to libnssckbi.so in /etc/pki/nssdb:
+ln -s /usr/lib[64]/libnssckbi.so /etc/pki/nssdb/libnssckbi.so

 In theory you should be able to do an @defines followed by an
 @build_vms from this directory and it will create brand new .olbs and
 an .exe.  I say in theory because every release of cURL tosses in a
 new twist that has to be addressed by updating the config-vms.h*

-dependant stuff in this config file to keep from having to wade

 Other Notes:
 
 The test suites are not supported as of 7.11.0.
