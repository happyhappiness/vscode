"COOKIES\n"
"\n"
"  Cookies are generally used by web servers to keep state information at the\n"
"  client's side. The server sets cookies by sending a response line in the\n"
"  headers that looks like 'Set-Cookie: <data>' where the data part then\n"
"  typically contains a set of NAME=VALUE pairs (separated by semicolons ';'\n"
"  like \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2;\"). The server can also specify for what\n"
"  path the \"cookie\" should be used for (by specifying \"path=value\"), when the\n"
"  cookie should expire (\"expire=DATE\"), for what domain to use it\n"
"  (\"domain=NAME\") and if it should be used on secure connections only\n"
"  (\"secure\").\n"
"\n"
"  If you've received a page from a server that contains a header like:\n"
"        Set-Cookie: sessionid=boo123; path=\"/foo\";\n"
"\n"
"  it means the server wants that first pair passed on when we get anything in\n"
"  a path beginning with \"/foo\".\n"
"\n"
"  Example, get a page that wants my name passed in a cookie:\n"
"\n"
"        curl -b \"name=Daniel\" www.sillypage.com\n"
