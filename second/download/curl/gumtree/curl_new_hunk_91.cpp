"       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-\n"
"       tication, ftp upload, HTTP post,  SSL  (https:)  connections,  cookies,\n"

"       The  URL  syntax is protocol dependent. You'll find a detailed descrip-\n"

"\n"
"        http://site.{one,two,three}.com\n"
"\n"
"       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n"
