"OPTIONS\n"
"     -a/--append\n"
"          (FTP) When used in a ftp upload, this will tell curl to\n"
"          append to the target file instead of overwriting it. If\n"
"          the file doesn't exist, it will be created.\n"
"\n"
"          If this option is  used  twice,  the  second  one  will\n"
"          disable append mode again.\n"
"\n"
"     -A/--user-agent <agent string>\n"
"          (HTTP)  Specify  the  User-Agent  string to send to the\n"
"          HTTP server. Some badly done CGIs fail if its  not  set\n"
"          to \"Mozilla/4.0\".  To encode blanks in the string, sur­\n"
"          round the string with single  quote  marks.   This  can\n"
"          also be set with the -H/--header flag of course.\n"
"\n"
"          If  this  option  is  used more than once, the last one\n"
"          will be the one to be used.\n"
"\n"
"     -b/--cookie <name=data>\n"
"          (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It\n"
"          is  supposedly  the  data  previously received from the\n"
"          server in a \"Set-Cookie:\" line.  The data should be  in\n"
"          the format \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2\".\n"
"\n"
"          If  no '=' letter is used in the line, it is treated as\n"
"          a filename to use  to  read  previously  stored  cookie\n"
"          lines  from,  which  should  be used in this session if\n"
"          they  match.  Using  this  method  also  activates  the\n"
"          \"cookie  parser\"  which  will make curl record incoming\n"
"          cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this in\n"
"          combination  with  the  -L/--location  option. The file\n"
"          format of the file to read cookies from should be plain\n"
"          HTTP headers or the netscape cookie file format.\n"
"\n"
"          NOTE  that  the file specified with -b/--cookie is only\n"
"          used as input. No cookies will be stored in  the  file.\n"
"          To store cookies, save the HTTP headers to a file using\n"
"          -D/--dump-header!\n"
"\n"
"          If this option is used more than  once,  the  last  one\n"
"          will be the one to be used.\n"
"\n"
"     -B/--use-ascii\n"
"          Use  ASCII  transfer  when  getting an FTP file or LDAP\n"
"          info. For FTP, this can also be enforced  by  using  an\n"
"          URL  that  ends with \";type=A\". This option causes data\n"

"\n"
"     -C/--continue-at <offset>\n"
"          Continue/Resume  a  previous file transfer at the given\n"
